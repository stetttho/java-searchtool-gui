 The best parts of this, Delillo's tenth, novel come early on when the principal character's histories and current lives are being set up.  The four characters presented here serve as a contrast to earlier Delillo  novels in that there is a greater range of characters.  Previous books, at  least the four I'd read) featured either first person narration or third  person strictly limited to one character's point of view and this one  character seemed to encounter an absurdist world revolving in which  everyone else is oblivious to his quixotic journey.  This novel and  Delillo's latest suffer from the same malady... many interesting characters  are set up and then encounter the same thematic predicament.  What I'm  getting at is this - it's very hard to believe that four to six characters  would follow a theme that revolves around terrorism and Beirut and  communist China.  I find it impossible to except people on the streets of  New York all talking about Beirut and Mao at the same time as a young man  in isolation in America thinks of Beirut and Mao while another character  sits in a cafe near Beirut speaking of Mao.  Delillo's ideas were more  concise in White Noise, Libra and Great Jones Street where the world  drifted into madness, represented by one characters journey.  Here, the  world drifts into madness and everybody seems to be talking about it.  Mao  II is still too great a piece of writing (as Underworld) to give any less  than four stars.
