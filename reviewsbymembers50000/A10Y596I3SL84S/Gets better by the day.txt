 At the end of Redford's best film,  Quiz Show, one of the indignent producers of "21" says that (to paraphraze) 'the quiz shows will be back, they'll just make the questions easier because no one was watching  for a display of intelectual prowess, but they were watching the money.'   With the flood of big money, small brains quiz shows with multiple choice  questions that have hit the air waves in the past year, no one can deny the  prophetic power of the film.  And with great performances and a lack of  clear good guys and bad guys, theres nothing that stops this from being one  of the best film of the 90's.
