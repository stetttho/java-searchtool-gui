 This was the fifteenth DVD added to my collection and let me say, this is what I expected from the DVD experience.  I thought Three Kings was the best film of 1999 and I won't go into it's political and stylistic genius.  What is praiseworthy about the DVD is not only the picture and sound  quality but the wide range of features, which are often short but very  informative.  In a short "video journal" director Russell takes  us from through some of the casting, rehearsals, production meeting and  then to premier night.  David O. Russell is the star of this DVD, coming  off often like a kid in a candy store as an independant director breaking  into big time, studio film making, but his presence in the video journal,  the documentary "Under the Bunker" and full legnth commentary  through the film and deleted scenes is very insightful and allows the  viewer to become a film making insider.  Other features include a  commentary by the cinematographer and a "tour" by the set  decorator (two people who were robbed of oscar nominations along with the  director by the way).  The "Intimate Look Inside the Acting Process  with Ice Cube" is basically a two minute joke directed by Spike Jonze  and there is also a full legnth commentary with the films producers (which  I haven't found interest enough to watch just yet.  All around, it's a  tight package with DVD ROM features that I haven't even had the chance to  explore yet.
