 This is not a movie that one should think about after viewing it.  In the climax, the murderer comes completely out of left field and has psychotic motives that no sane person could have possibly expected (I heartily  disagree with the person who says he knew the killer from the trailer).   Being unpredictable is not always good. But despite all this, this movie  has a (albeit unintentionally) hilarious climatic sequence and enough  artificial tension to make it somewhat enjoyable on the first go around.
