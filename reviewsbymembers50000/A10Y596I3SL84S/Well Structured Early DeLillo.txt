 Great Jones Street is a wonderfully claire voyant novel that works sharply with themes that are of immense importance in the modern world.  It is about pop arts, consumerism, the American junk culture and all the things  that you can expect from DeLillo with the added element of dealing with  problems with celebrity.  Even when Bucky Wunderlick looks to escape from  "his" life to be alone, his isolation becomes more valuable to  others than it was meant to be to himself.  This book deftly explores how  the modern culture is dangerously obsessed with the lives of the few.   Above all else, this is a more tightly structured novel than the later,  greater works of DeLillo.  Its opening pages lead right to the crux of the  narrative and handles changes in time and place much smoother than Mao II  and Underworld despite its hazy atmosphere.
