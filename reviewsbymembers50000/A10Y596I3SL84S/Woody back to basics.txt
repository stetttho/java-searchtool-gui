 It's such a shame that Woody Allen's films just aren't opened to the large audiences anymore.  Sweet and Lowdown, Allen's latest comedic invention, is a film that seems to go back to style of comedic farce and character study  that Woody took on in his first major films.  At times a mock documentary  in the vein of "Take the Money and Run" and "Zelig",  Sweet and Lowdown is a more mature film that has a lot more notes to it  than the early movies.  This film also features something that no other  Allen film has had - a truly transformative performance from an actor.   Sean Penn and Allen paint such a quircky and complex character that I  actually left the theatre thinking Emmitt Ray must have been a real person.   Surely no filmakers and actor could come up with such a figure.  But alas  they did and this is the magic of this film which also features great  supporting work and good music to boot.
