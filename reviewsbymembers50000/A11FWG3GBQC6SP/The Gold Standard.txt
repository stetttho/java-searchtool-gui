 Someone once told Mark Twain that his works were classics.  He said, "Oh God, I hope not!"  "Why is that?"  "Because," he replied, "a classic is something that everyone praises and nobody reads."  Free To Choose is not only a true classic in the field but is a practical guide for setting public policy and understanding our world.  If you read and absorb this book you will understand more about economics than most people who have degrees in the subject.   Friedman makes his case clearly and with real world cases that are undenieable.  For example, he examines the causes and explains the conditions which existed on each side of the Berlin Wall.  He points to many examples from life to make his points, and as one with a bachelor's in the subject I can tell you that no education in economics is complete without having read this book.  It should be required reading for every high school economics course and every entry-level college course.  He makes the case for free markets by discussing trade, interest rates, education, consumer and worker protection, etc.  Those who are attracted to governmental solutions to all of life's ills will find this to be hard reading.  Though you may disagree with Friedman you must confront his arguments.  As John Adams famously said, "You are entitled to your own set of opinions.  You are not entitled to your own set of facts."
