 Ambrose began with some background on Lewis and Jefferson, the political circumstances of the time and how the expedition was organized.  He then told the tale of the trip itself and finished with a short aftermath touching on Lewis and Clark's post-expedition activities, Lewis' untimely death and Jefferson's frustrations at not having a final narrative of the journals. So many great stories here: the exedition's wintering in North Dakota (at 45 below zero); their close calls with grizzly bears and near starvation in the Bitterroots; their many interactions with the Indians; Lewis' discovery of the Great Falls of the Missouri; the first vote by a woman and a black man on the North American continent; Lewis accidently getting shot by one of his own men; etc., etc.  Too many vignettes to list and Ambrose brings each one to life. You can smell the smoke of their fires and feel the cactus punching through the soles of their elkskin mocossins.  The maps are first class too. I appreciated the clear layout of the topography showing where these events took place with respect to modern day cities and roads and have used them to follow parts of the Lewis & Clark Trail.  The fact that the Lewis & Clark Expedition was a passion of Stephen Ambrose really came through in this great book and made for some exhilerating writing. (Ambrose started camping along the trail in 1976 and maintained a home in Helena, MT.)  There are times I literally got goosebumps while reading and closed the book with a deep sigh, prompting my wife to ask, "What?!"   Fascinating - educational - very readable. Undaunted Courage gets my highest recommendation.
