 If you don't like Bill Bennett don't bother with this book.  If you are interested in understanding the conservative arguement for using force there is no better resource, including Augustine.  Ditto if you are a conservative who wants to hear someone defend what you instinctively believe. Many of the arguements against the use of force come from the religious left (we never seem to hear the term "religious left" for some reason).  Anyway, religious questions require religious answers and there is some of that in Why We Fight.  Other criticism of U.S. policy comes from the secular arena --the professoriate, the vocational protesters, those jockeying for political position and their henchmen in the press.  Each is addressed on its own terms. In typical Bennett style, this is a quick read but it packs a wallop.
