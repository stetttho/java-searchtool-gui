 When a friend or family member faces a crisis you don't have time to read a book. You need immediate, practical advice on how to help --and how NOT to help. Many crisis are covered (death of a child, miscarriage, unemployment, incarceration of a loved one, elderly vicimization, divorce, HIV, burglary, natural disasters, etc, etc.).     We often want to help but don't know how. Each crisis gets about six pages of coverage including a short summary of what people are facing with this crisis and several examples of helpful things to say, as well as specific things not to say. Then there are some recommended scriptures for each situation plus a short, appropriate prayer and a list of resources for further study.     The beginning of the book has a short section on crisis intervention and two other short sections on the grief process and the tool of forgiveness. It finishes up with a study guide on 15 of the most common types of crisis and provides a tool for a small group to learn about them in more depth.     When we got our copy my wife and I used it about five times in the first two weeks. I gave a copy to one of our pastors who says he has "worn it out." We have given it to other Christian friends of ours and a study has now sprung up at our church centered around this book. "Helping A Neighbor In Crisis" should be on the bookshelf of every practicing Christian, not just pastors and counselors. It is exceptionally practical, readable, and helpful. It gets a five only because there aren't any more stars.
