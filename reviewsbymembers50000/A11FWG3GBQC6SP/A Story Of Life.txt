 Humor. Tragedy. Beauty and depth.  Great characters. Middleton has a wonderful pen.  I thought it started out very slow, but the rest was good.  This is a story about life.  Although there were three of them the old men reminded me of Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon -they were quite humorous- and Starlight Creek reminded me of a place I go where no one can find me.    If you are a fly fisherman you will connect with the environment here; the ecosystem and oneness of life; the beauty of the landscape and our role in it.  Not in the wine sipper's hoity toity way, but in the way of our old grandfathers.  Real outdoorsmen.  Guys who drove old trucks, wore patched waders and took biscuits with them rolled up in kitchen towels.   If you aren't a flyfisherman perhaps you will be stirred by what it's like to get to the creek at daybreak, with hopes that a trout will rise.
