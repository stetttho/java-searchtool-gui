 News Flash: The people you work with are human beings.  Here's a great book on how to convince them that you're one too.  If you don't do a good job of recognizing others your organization is underperforming.  Period.  I like the fact that Encouraging The Heart is not the usual collection of little vignettes about how CEOs do it.  Those are good examples too, but CEOs make up such a small percentage of the population their experiences do not represent where the rest of us live.  Instead, Kouzes and Posner provide real-world examples of how "normal" people exercise this crucial aspect of leadership.  Lots of fun and interesting How-Tos, but more than that, a set of principles from which to think up your own ways of doing it.  Chapters 1-3 drive home the basic message that the best leaders care.  They present research, a good case-study, and an assessment index for you.  Chapters 4-10 explore the seven essentials in detail (setting clear standards, expecting the best, paying attention, personalizing recognition, storytelling, celebrating, and setting a good example.)  Great stuff here.  Chatper 11 is about finding your own voice and not operating out of someone else's vocabulary --a maturing process, and Chapter 12 has 150 ways to encourage covering all seven essential areas.  The best book on recognition I've found.
