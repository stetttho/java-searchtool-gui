 McCullough has done our country a great service by reintroducing us to Mr. Adams.  What a giant.  What integrity. And what sacrifices he (and Abigail) made for our country.   Most interesting were his years in Europe and all of his behind the scenes negotiations which kept our young country afloat.  There are wonderful stories of his meetings at Versailles, his appearance before George III, his visit to the church in Holland where the Pilgrims came from, and his long ride over the mountains in Portugal (on horseback, in winter).  Also, very candid and revealing tidbits about Franklin, and an unvarnished look at Jefferson. What Adams did for this country is unfathomable, and this book should be read by every American over the age of 16.  Too many other things to tell (his law practice, his defense of the British soldiers from the Boston Massacre, his insistence that Jefferson write the Declaration, the devesating losses of his son and daughter, his retirement, etc.)   Six years in the making, McCullough does Adams justice with his excellent research, and does a masterful job at weaving it all into a great story which gives Adams his due; he has been so underappreciated.  You owe it to yourself to read this book and have it in your library.
