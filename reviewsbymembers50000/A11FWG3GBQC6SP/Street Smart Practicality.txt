 Can't really improve on Robert Morris' review of this book.  He cover's it well.  My own observation is that this is a "real" book, not ivory tower fluff.  Stack is a guy that was grinding it out in the trenches and adapting as he went along.  You know he's someone who speaks from experience. An interesting footnote here is that I read in an airline magazine the results of a poll of people who "loved their jobs" and thought they had "the best jobs in the world."  One of the people quoted was a lady  who works for Stack at Springfield Remanufacturing.  She washes diesel engine parts.
