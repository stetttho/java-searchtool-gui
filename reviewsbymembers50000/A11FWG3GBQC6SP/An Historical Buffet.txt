 I can see him at his computer banging out this book, trying to get everything he wanted to say out there and tie up the loose ends before passing away.  This book covers a lot of ground (Vietnam, Women's Rights, the Indians, Theodore Roosevelt, Grant, the Founders, Nixon, Ike, WWII, etc.).  Loved his discussion of the creation of the D-Day Museum in New Orleans, and all of the stories of meeting and talking to the vets who participated in the action.  Each chapter is short, usually 10 to 15 pages.  So, you can start wherever you want to and skip around.  Makes for great reading when your available time is segmented.  I usually don't have hours and hours to just sit and read.  I was struck by things he'd say like (paraphrasing) "When I was a kid professor I taught the only thing I knew, which was what I myself had been taught. Now I know a lot of that was garbage."  Then he'd go on and set the record straight.  And he struck a great balance.  What I mean by that is the tone of his writing was appropriate and straightforward without being politically correct.  He said some things that will undoubtedly offend the post-modern mind but he tells it like it was.  And I disagreed with him on several things too.  For example, I thought he was pretty hard on the founders, particularly Jefferson.  But that's just a matter of opinion.  When you are on your deathbed you don't care what other people think.  You write honestly and plainly and I have enormous respect for that.  Dr. Ambrose has taught me a great deal and I am grateful for his life.
