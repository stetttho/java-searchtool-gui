 I was afraid that reading this book was going to be an exercise in plowing through a bunch of Civil War trivia, but it seemed too short for that and was. There's enough to make it interesting, but Foote doesn't bury you in all the trivia.  If you are the least bit interested in the Civil War you will love this book. Though not a true "buff" I bought and read it because I was about to go to Gettysburg and wanted to be able to know what I was looking at when I got there. That was a great decision.  It was a fine blend of the personalities involved, the politics at the time, the factors that influenced this or that strategy, and the impact the battle had on the outcome of the war as a whole. Indeed, on us as a people.
