 After ten or twelve pages my first observation was that Meier is very, very readable.  His style flows effortlessly and goes down without a lot of chewing.  He is also very transparent, using a lot of illustrations from his own life to make his points.  He is very much a "one of us" kind of guy who has struggled with the same problems normal people have.   This book will enable you to recognize "jerky" behavior in yourself as well as others and better understand where it comes from (and how to change it).  We run into jerks everywhere we go in life and the more skilled we are in dealing with them the smoother our journeys will be.  This book will be enormously comforting if you have any abuse in your background.   Meier cites many spiritual truths throughout the book and writes from that perspective.  If you are put off by spiritual things I recommend that you at least consider the wisdom of what he has to say.  I read so many little passages out of it to my wife that she read it when I was done and we have recommended it to friends and family.
