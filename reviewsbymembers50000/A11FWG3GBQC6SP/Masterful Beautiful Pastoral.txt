 Parkening is to guitar what Barishnakov is to dance.  I don't think it's an overreach to say that Parkening IS guitar.  Simple Gifts has been in my collection for a long time - it is magnificent, and refreshingly different.  Great classical interpretations of some of the old hymns --out of vogue these days, but if you love them you'll love this.  As far as classical pieces go I especially love Mozart's Laudate Dominum (from his Solumn Vespers) and Parkening does a masterful job on it.   The Englebert Humperdink piece from Hansel and Gretel is great too.  Very pastoral.
