 This book was cute, but all it really says is that change is going to happen in life and that you should try to predict it and plan for it.  Don't bury your head in the sand. Don't live in denial about it.  And don't try to blame everyone else when the winds of change blow and you are unprepared.  Stuff happens.  Learn to deal with it and get on down life's highway.
