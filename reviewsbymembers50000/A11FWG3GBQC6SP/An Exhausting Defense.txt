 Two stars for excrutiatingly detailed notes. However, the continuous stream of names is difficult to follow and makes for a cumbersome read.  Liberals will appreciate this book (we all like to hear what we agree with) and conservatives will find it an endurance test. The authors take great pains to establish the obvious. The fact that there are many people who don't like the Clintons is a given --no book was necessary to establish that. That there are also some unscrupulous operatives on the right side of the isle is also no big surprise. (Who on the left will cast the first stone?) Although it acknowledges Clinton is flawed, at the end of the day it's the OJ defense repackaged: The Clintons are the victims of a huge, corrupt, underground network organized against them.  Anyone whose character (as Bill Bennett put it) "manifests itself in patterns of reckless personal conduct, deceit, abuse of power, and contempt for the rule of law" is brought down by their own hand. As a conservative who reads "your" books, I challenge you all to read, as a contrast to The Hunting, Bennett's "The Death of Outrage." Unlike this book it is very short. It is also riveted on the facts and chases no rabbit trails. It will, however, be very uncomfortable for you and require some discipline. Regards, DEF
