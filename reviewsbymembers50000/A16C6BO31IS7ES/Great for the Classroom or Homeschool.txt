 This thematic unit is based on Roman history and includes a research project, creative writing activities, higher level thinking skills (fact vs. opinion, sequential thinking, evaluation and synthesis).   Students explore Roman geography and meet many famous and colorful Roman figures, including Cincinnatus, Julius Caesar, Augustus Caesar, Romulus and Remus, and many Roman emperors.  Junior high school students will also find the activities relating to gladiators, Roman soldiers and chariot races fascinating.  Aspects of Roman culture and life are also covered.  Students will learn about the class system of patricians, plebians and slaves and what life was like for Roman women.   The impact of Roman culture and government upon the American system is also part of this thematic unit.  Students are challenged to find connections between ancient Rome and modern America.   There are suggestions for further reading as well as a list of Roman-themed movies that might be suitable for viewing in the classroom. The activities in this book are indeed challenging and there's certainly more than enough material here for an outstanding Ancient Rome unit in a social studies class.  It would also be useful for a Latin teacher who wants to incorporate cultural material into the language curriculum.
