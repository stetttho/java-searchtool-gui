 This is a very good thematic unit for younger elementary age students.  It is reproducible and so suitable for classroom teachers.  Students will learn about the basic history, geography, government, and culture of Rome.  Fascinating stories from Roman history are retold and children are encouraged to find out more.  Story starters are provided to motivate creative thinking.  Children are introduced to some simple Latin words so that they can make the connection between the ancient language and modern English.  Young people are also introduced to Roman mythology and cultural achievements.  There are games, crossword puzzles, project ideas, word searches, research ideas, and maps.  Colorful time period stickers are included as well. The material is challenging and interesting, but it is also basic so as not to be overwhelming.  All in all, a nice introduction for elementary school students.
