 Based upon the Iliad, the story of the Trojan War, this is a wonderful activity book for young children learning about the ancient Greeks.  This book is based upon the second half of the epic.  What's really fantastic about this coloring book is that the art is culturally authentic, based upon real vase paintings from Ancient Greece.  The story of the Iliad is retold in captions that accompany rich black and white line art.   We see not only the characters we might expect: Hector, Achilles, Patroclus, Diomedes, Paris, Ajax, Neoptolemus and Menelaus, but the book also includes women from the epic: Helen, Cassandra, Creusa, Andromache, and Penthesilia the Amazon (think Xena the Warrior Princess, but not camp).  Professor Anderson also includes a picture of an African warrior from Ethiopia. Brief Greek quotations are scattered throughout the book and may interest young people in learning the Greek alphabet. These books are great because they are of excellent quality and very inexpensive and certain to excite the imaginations of bright young children!
