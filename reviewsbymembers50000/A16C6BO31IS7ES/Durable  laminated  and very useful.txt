 This is an extremely durable and laminated 8 1/2 X 11 card that contains nearly any grammar rule that you might need to know.  It is pre-punched so that you can carry it around in a three ring binder with you.  I have had my Latin Grammar Card for many years and it's still in great shape!  Yes, you can certainly find any of these grammar rules on the Internet for free, but can you condense them all down so that they fit on a 2 sided card?  It won't replace a good Latin grammar book, but it is definitely easier to carry and will certainly help you tell your declensions from your conjugations!
