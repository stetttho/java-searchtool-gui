 This is an outstanding book to add to your classroom or homeschooling library.  If you don't live near the British Museum or Museum of London, then this book is the next best thing!  See a Roman gladius (sword) and gold and silver scabbards.  Examine a Roman soldier's armor and impedimenta (baggage).  Find out what life was like for women and children.  There are photographs of actual children's toys, gladiatorial helmets, chariots, theater masks, even medical instruments and leather sandals.   The photography in this book is fabulous.  Students can use this book to get ideas for reports or designing models.  The pictures are bright and beautiful and really make the ancient Roman culture come to life!
