 I would especially recommend this book for homeschooling parents who want a lively and interesting introduction to Roman culture for their children.  Written in question and answer format, children will learn how modern culture compares and contrasts with the ancient world.   How do you put on a toga?  Did Roman women wear makeup?  How were mosaics made?  What was it like inside a roman house?  Did they have toilets?  Who and what were gladiators?  Did the Romans have zoos?   The color illustrations are terrific!  A great book for older elementary and middle school students!
