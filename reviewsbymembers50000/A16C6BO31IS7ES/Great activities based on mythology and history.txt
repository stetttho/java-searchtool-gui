 This is a thematic book with ready to use reproducible activities for the classroom or homeschool.  It is written for use with Connolly's "The Legend of Odysseus" but it would work well in conjunction with D'Aulaire's Book of Greek Myths or Bernard Evslin's series of mythology stories for young readers.  I am not familiar with Connolly's book, but I am acquainted with D'Aulaire's and Evslin's books.  There are hands on activities including games to play, mazes to design, pictures to color, writing activities, and an archaeology simulation and a research project.  The material crosses the curriculum into math, science, literature, government, geography, art, speech, even physical education.  Students are introduced to mythology, Greek geography, climate, the Greek alphabet, vocabulary derivation from the Greek language, columns and architecture, the Greek city-state, Greek art and culture, and the Olympics. Middle school students will really enjoy the activities in this book and will want to learn more upon its completion.
