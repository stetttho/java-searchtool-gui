 The authors and illustrators do admit that you are in for some "chills and thrills" in this dot to dot book.  For some reason, this book has been listed as appropriate for four to eight year olds, but it is probably more appropriate for 6 to 9 year olds.  Of course, parents will know whether or not their children will be able to handle the big and scary monsters in this book -- among them, beast from classical mythology, including Medusa, the Minotaur, Sirens and Cyclops.  But there are also some more modern monsters: Gollum (from Tolkien's "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings,"), Quasimodo ("Hunchback of Notre Dame"), the Beast (from "Beauty and the Beast"), the Phantom of the Opera (think of the opera), the Headless Horseman ("Ichabod Crane"), Count Dracula, the Bride of Frankenstein, werewolves, trolls, vampire bats, and King Kong. There are even monsters from nature: the Giant Octopus and Jenny Haniver (a South American sting ray). The content of this activity book is not bad and in fact might lead children to explore the literary origins of these beasts, but it is certainly better suited for older children than for preschoolers.
