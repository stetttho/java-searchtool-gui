 Printed on high quality paper with a glossy, foldover velcro cover, this is not a cheap, crummy coloring book that you'd find in a supermarket or discount store.   Each beautifully drawn and nicely detailed picture is accompanied by a short story from mythology.  Difficult words are glossed so that children can learn to pronounce the names of the characters and animals that they are coloring. There are 16 stories and over fifty pictures to color as well as a 17 X 22 ready-to-color poster.  The tales are adapted from Bulfinch's Mythology, a well-known classic retelling of the Greek tales.  Included are: Hercules, the Odyssey, Daedalus and Icarus, Orpheus and Eurydice, Pygmalion, Phaethon, Medusa and Arachne, Cupid and Psyche, Atalanta, Baucis and Philemon, Pegasus and others.  There are nice illustrations of many mythical beasts including the Hydra, the Cyclops, the Sirens and more.   When your child is finished coloring the pictures, the book is sturdy and high quality enough to take its place on his or her bookshelf to be enjoyed again and again.   An excellent introduction to the Greek myths for children.
