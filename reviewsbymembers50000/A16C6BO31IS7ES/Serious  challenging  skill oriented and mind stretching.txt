 This is a fine thematic unit based upon myths and fables.  It is challenging and rigorous.  Students first take a pre-test so that the teacher can find out what students already know about mythology in general.  After that, they are introduced to Greek mythology and given its context in time.  Students learn about the Greek and Roman gods.  Familiar myths such as Arachne, Echo and Narcissus, Phaethon, Io, Pegasus, Pygmalion, Icarus and more are presented to the students along with a plethora of extension activities to build upon language and vocabulary and higher level thinking.  The four focus areas of this unit are vocabulary, literal comprehension, interpretive comprehension and literary terms.  Critical thinking activities are presented: making inferences, characterization, compare/contrast, analogies, and distinguishing multiple meanings.   Interspersed throughout the unit are creative writing activities, hands-on games, artistic activities, mazes, crosswords, debate topics, dictionary and research activities and more.   There is a reproducible reading skills checklist provided at the end of the book for the teacher's convenience. This is an excellent resource for teachers who want to provide students not only with cultural and historical material, but also want to incorporate serious language and thinking skills into the curriculum. An excellent bibliography is provided which includes reading material of varying skill level.  There is also an answer key.
