 The Amelia Peabody mysteries are always a treat, and this is another satisfactory addition to the series.  My sole criticisms are that the pace was unusually slow up to about the last quarter of the book, and I would  have enjoyed a happier  ending.  Obviously, the ending of this book is  meant to set the stage for the next book in the series, but a bit more  positive closure in certain relationships would have been welcome.
