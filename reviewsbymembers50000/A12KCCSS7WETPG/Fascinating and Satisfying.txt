 Another fascinating installment in the series.  I found this book particularly satisfying in that it tied up several loose ends from the previous book.  Throughout the books, Gabaldon fleshes out her characters until they fairly glow with life. Her meticulous attention to historical detail gives one a true sense of what it must have been like to live during earlier eras in Europe and North America.  In order to refresh my memory, I reread the entire series before starting in on the new book.  That's a lot of reading, but I don't regret a minute I spent with Claire, Jamie, and their extended family!  This latest book is a wonderful addition to a truly outstanding series.
