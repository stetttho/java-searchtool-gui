 I don't know, maybe there's something about this movie that I just don't get. I didn't read the book because, quite frankly, the "cutesy" title turned me off.  However, when the movie came out I noted (as others have) that the cast was quite respectable.  I thought James Garner, Maggie Smith, and Ellen Burstyn weren't likely to waste their time appearing in a negligible vehicle.  Having watched the movie, I will say that I definitely don't get how such old pros got themselves involved in making it.  In fact, I would suggest a much more descriptive title for the movie (one that might help others understand what they are in for before they sit down to watch it):  "Southern Gothic Meets the Stoogettes in Self-Indulgence Land."  If that sounds good to you (and everyone is certainly entitled to their own tastes), you probably will enjoy this movie.  If not, you might enjoy Steel Magnolias, Fried Green Tomatoes, or Driving Miss Daisy a heckuva lot better--I know I did.
