 I used Memorex CD-RWs until I had a very disappointing experience with a spindle of 25--my XP system could not write to a single one.  I then purchased these Fujifilm disks, because I read a user review stating that their manufacturing standards were much higher than other vendors.  Not only did all the Fuji CD-RWs work flawlessly in my disk drive, my system also recognized them immediately.  Even with Memorex disks that worked, there was always a lengthy lag between the time I put the disk into the drive and the time when the computer recognized it was writable.  I'm sold on Fuji disks now!
