 Anyone who purchases third-party items on Amazon (like this watch, which actually is shipped from FansEdge) should be aware that they are going to be out of luck if they have any problems or need to adjust their orders in any way.  Amazon won't help you, and the third-party store probably won't either.  You don't know where the third-party store is coming from, and you may be faced with another problem that is becoming increasingly common with Internet stores--support people with very limited communication skills, especially when it comes to communicating in the English language.  That was my experience, and I will NEVER order third-party items from Amazon again.
