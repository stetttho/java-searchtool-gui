 Let me first of all say that I am NOT a Hemera employee--I have worked in military and public education for many years.  I make extensive personal and professional use of the Hemera Photo Objects collections for websites, newsletters, and presentation aids, and I'm very pleased to see that they are offering this new collection. In my humble opinion, Photo Objects are colorful and clean cut--the images of children are especially nice.  Perhaps the selection is somewhat generic and mainstream; but in my experience, they also are easily related to by a broad spectrum of people.  I find the Photo Object software very easy to use--I simply select an image from the thumbnails, choose the options I want (background, sizing, etc.), then save the image in the best file format for my needs.  I wouldn't presume to speak for anyone else, but the Photo Objects collections are a great, affordable graphics resource for me.
