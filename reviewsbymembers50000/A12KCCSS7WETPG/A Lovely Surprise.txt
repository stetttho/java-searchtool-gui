 Savage Garden is like a breath of fresh air--intelligent lyrics and an engaging sound. In an age of technology and interpersonal alienation, it's nice to hear music about real feelings and deep relationships,  presented  with sincerity and heart.  Thank you, Australia, for offering up this very  appetizing treat to jaded palates in America and elsewhere.
