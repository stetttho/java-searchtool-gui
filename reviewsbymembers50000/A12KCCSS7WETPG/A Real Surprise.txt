 I bought this book (from Amazon.com, of course) because the subject matter interested me.  I had never heard of the author, and apparently he hasn't written much of anything else, except a book on English composition.  What a wonderful surprise it was to find the book such a satisfying read!   It's a long book (almost 1,000 pages), but it never flags or drags.  The author alternates the text of old letters and accounts from people who lived through the 1811-12 New Madrid earthquakes with his fictional narrative, and also includes some fascinating factual information about earthquakes--especially nice for those of us who avoided taking geology in school.  :-)   The plot follows several characters who live through a new series of earthquakes in current times.  All the characters are very well developed and believable--this author KNOWS people and he knows how to write about them.  I especially enjoyed the interaction and relationship that develops between the middle-aged African American son of an Army general and the young white child of a "New Age" mother and lawyer father, who end up traveling down the Mississippi together after the first in the series of modern earthquakes.  There is plenty of action and a great deal of wry humor in this book.  Now I only wish Walter J. Williams had another work of fiction available to purchase and read.
