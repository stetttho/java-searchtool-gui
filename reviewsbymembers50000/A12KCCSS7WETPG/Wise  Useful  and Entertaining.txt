 While this is not a mega-sized collection of quotes (just one quote per page) it IS an amazing selection of time-tested wisdom, humor, and experience.  I collect quotations; and this book was an outstanding resource from that standpoint, since the preponderant majority of the quotes were "keepers."  I have collected 20,000+ in a personal database over more than a decade (an odd hobby, some would say, but I guess I'm pretty easily amused).  While a few of the quotes familiar to me, most were fresh and original, and the preponderant majority were "keepers."  But you don't have to be a quotation collector to enjoy this book; if you're looking for inspiration, "words to live by," (from folks who have "been there,done that"), or if you just enjoy reading books that give you something to think about and more than a few chuckles along the way, I believe you will thoroughly enjoy it.
