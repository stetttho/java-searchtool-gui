 At a time when many Americans are going back to their cultural roots with a renewed sense of appreciation, this CD really hits the spot!  Sure, Rod's voice has changed somewhat over the years and perhaps as a result of his recent surgery; but his charm and mature stylization seem uniquely suited to these selections.  My all-time favorite Rod Stewart CD is If We Fall in Love Tonight, which also showcases his softer side; this new CD ranks right up there with my previous favorite.
