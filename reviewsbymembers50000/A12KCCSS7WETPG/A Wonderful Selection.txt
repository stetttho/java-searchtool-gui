 This book features wonderful quotes, many by well-known, contemporary sources.  I would have given it a 5-star rating, except that some of the quotes are repeated several times throughout the book under different subject headings. Nonetheless, there still are an impressive number of unique quotes here--not just the usual selection, but some true rarities.
