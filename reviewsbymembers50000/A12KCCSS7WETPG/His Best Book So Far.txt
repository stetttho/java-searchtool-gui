 I am an unabashed Dean Koontz fan; I believe I have read every book he has written, even the ones written under a pseudonym.  I enjoyed them all, but Seize the Night comes out on top of the heap.  Together with Fear Nothing,  it speaks of the courage, love, friendship, and the experience of those who  live their lives on the outside looking in.  In his masterful way, Koontz  draws you into the world of the different and unusual as no one else does.   His portrayal of the dog, Orson, is especially touching. This book really  rates six stars!
