 While it is true that this book does NOT contain quotations from movies, what it does contain is something much better.  As a collector of quotations, I have found it strangely difficult to find quotes by  contemporary, non-literary celebrities.  What this book actually contains  is exceptional quotes from movie stars, directors, and others involved in  movie business--not only about film making, but on general subjects as  well.  A change of title and keywords would do this book a world of good.   I just feel fortunate to have stumbled across it.
