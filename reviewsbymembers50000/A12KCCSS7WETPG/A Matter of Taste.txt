 I think most of us here rate a book on the basis of our own tastes--what kinds of books we personally enjoy reading.  Sue Grafton's alphabet series really isn't about non-stop action or heart-stopping adventure.  What it about is one of the most quirky, engaging characters in modern mysteries:  Kinsey Milhone.  I've read the whole series to date, and in the process I have come to know and care about Kinsey. As each book comes out, I look forward to finding out what Kinsey is up now; and just as importantly, how she sees her life and the other characters that populate her world.  Sue Grafton has crafted Kinsey with a deft touch and a generous dollop of wry humor.  For my reading tastes, "N is for Noose" is another delightful installment in the series.  I just hope Sue Grafton will start in on numbers when she runs out of alphabet, so this series can go on and on.
