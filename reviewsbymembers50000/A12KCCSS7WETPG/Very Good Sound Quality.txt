 I would give this headset a 5-star rating, except for a few  things.  While the headset was rated for XP, when I installed it on my XP system, I got a security warning that the drivers were not properly signed.  I went ahead and installed them anyway, and haven't had any problems so far with the headset, but it did give me pause... The other thing is that it would be nice to have a button on the headset itself to turn the headset off when you're not using it.  There is a button on the cord to mute the mike, but not to turn off the headset sound.  And as previously mentioned by other reviewers, you have to go into control panel to switch back to your regular computer speakers--seems like there should be an easier way to do that, perhaps incorporating that change into an on/off feature that's readily accessible on the headset.  Other than that the headset does give great sound quality, which was my primary consideration in purchasing it.
