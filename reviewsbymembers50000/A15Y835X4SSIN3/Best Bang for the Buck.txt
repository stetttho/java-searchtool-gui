 After extensive research in the PDA market, I purchased the Helio 3 months ago and I can't be any happier. It comes with a huge 8mb of memory which is hard to find in other PDA's at this price level. Also another big plus is the voice recorder which comes with an amazing avg of 50 mins fo recording time. You can leave voice messages for yourself or even record entire meetings! The screen is also backlit which makes for easy operation in the dark. You can also choose from different colors which sets the helio apart from the boring PDA's out there. Don't let the lack of thrid party software scare you off because first Vtech seems to be working hard to create new software on its site (new progams have been popping up lately such as a program that lets you download websites to the helio). Second, ask yourself if you will realistically be using half of the excessive features found in PDA's twice as expensive? The Helio won't walk your dog for you but this is a great value with exeptional features for anyone who is looking for a basic scheduling, emailing, and organizational features.
