 I first stumbled upon this jewel at a Virgin Megastore listening station and I am lucky I did. Her music is infused with a Brazilian edge and is more upbeat than your traditional pop jazz. I've been waiting a few years for her follow up and I found it a few days ago.  FYI: NEW ALBUM IS AVAILABLE HOWEVER YOU CAN ONLY GET IT FROM HER WEBSITE.
