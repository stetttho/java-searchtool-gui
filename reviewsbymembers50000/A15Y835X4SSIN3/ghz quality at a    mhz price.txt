 This phone is comparable if not better than most 2.4 ghz phones out there. Most of this can be attributed to the Digital Spread Spectrum which really improves the distance that this phone can operate at and also provide maximum quality. I use this im my dorm room where there are about 100 other phones on the same floor and I can go from outside from the third floor and even into another building and get near perfect reception. I also compared the quality and distance with one of the Panasonic 2.4 ghz phones and this phone outperformed the 2.4 by about 10 feet. The three line display allows you to see the number  that you are dialing and also make programming numbers with names a breeze. The screen and the keypad is backlit so you can use it day or night. This is a great phone at a great price.
