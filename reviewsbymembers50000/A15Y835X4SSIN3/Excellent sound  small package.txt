 This system not only looks great, but sounds amazing. The small size makes it suitable for a dorm room, office or bed room but the sound can defintely fill an entire apartment easily. The speakers produce trmendous bass for its size. When cominbined with the sound virtualizing feature on the system, the speaker produce a crisp and undisorted bass sound. One hesitiation I had before buying the system was the missing cassestte deck but I am not missing it at all. The sound more than makes up for the obsolete deck. This is a great value and a great sounding system!
