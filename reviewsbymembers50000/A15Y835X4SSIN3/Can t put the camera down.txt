 This camera is a tremendous value for both the aspiring and expert photographer. It is packed with features such as fully automatic mode (can be switched back from manual mode at a touch of a button) to catch those unexpected picture moments and aperture and shutter priority modes. The multiple subject program modes (portrait, night, close up, landscape etc) make professional quality pictures possible at a touch of a button. Another great feature that this camera offers is the ability to take panoramic pictures at a touch of a button so you can get those long scenic shots with no problem. No need for the expensive Advantix systems. This camera is hard to put down because it is designed with an amatuer in mind and very easy to understand manual makes operating the camera a pleasure. It is lightweight but yet substantial enough to prevent shaking while holding the camera. I have gone through 5 rolls in 2 days and the quality of the prints are superb especially when using the potrait mode. Images are clear and precise in automatic mode. The lens is sufficient but if you can afford the telephoto lens, go for it. The balance between price and features makes the STsi a must have for anyone looking for a new camera SLR or point and shoot.
