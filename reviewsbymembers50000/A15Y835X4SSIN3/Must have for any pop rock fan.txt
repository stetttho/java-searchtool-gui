 Lifehouse is a refreshing break from all of the candy pop out now. The very popular Hanging By A Moment has climed the billboard chart but it does not do the band justice. The song is on the rather hard side of the wide spectrum of songs on this cd. Songs like Breathing and Somewhere In Between really capture lead singer Jason Wade's soulful and melodic voice. The CD is pop rock but is more easier on the ear than other similar band such as Matchbox 20 and Live. Lifehouse has made a CD that is radio friendly but will prove to be a very good buy for Matchbox and Live fans.
