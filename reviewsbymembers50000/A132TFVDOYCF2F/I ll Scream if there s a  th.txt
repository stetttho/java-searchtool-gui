 The only thing to scream about in this tired installment is Courtney Cox's bad wig!  The film is tired. Once again someone wants Sydney and will kill everyone she knows. The reason the fisrt Scream film was so great was that  it poked fun at Bad films . Now Scream has become a parody of itself. No  more please......
