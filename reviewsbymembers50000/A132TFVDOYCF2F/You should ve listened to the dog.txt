 Michael Pare' gives a good performance as uncle Ted. An explorer/adventurer who is attatcked by a werewolf on an expedition, he survives and heads back to the states where he moves onto his sisters property and begins a killing spree of his own. No one suspects a thing except the family dog, Thor, and no one listens to him. Good for it's type, The effects are campy and everyone plays it pretty straight. Best scene involves Pare' Peeing on the dog house to mark his territory.  Three and a half stars.  Could use some extra features.
