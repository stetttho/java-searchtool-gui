 How cool was Mickey Roarke? Check this film out and see for yourself. I love this movie. Micky plays Charlie a small time hood tryin to go straight in New Yorks little Italy, No matter how hard he tries he just can't escape  the neighborhood or his Lowlife cousin Paulie,wonderfully acted by Eric  Roberts. Yes at one time he could act too (See Star 80). Rounding out the  cast are Geraldine Paige, Daryl Hannah and Kenneth McMillon, But the movie  belongs to Rourke it was a springboard to things that never were to be. To  bad.
