 This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. That counts student films,All of the movies on IFILM. Every movie anywhere. This thing is not even a movie it's a collection of unfunny bits  With the actors standing on their marks not moving for fear of falling out of frame or stepping out of their key light if there were any key lights. (...). I hope everyone reads this and saves themselves the pain of sitting and trying to watch it.
