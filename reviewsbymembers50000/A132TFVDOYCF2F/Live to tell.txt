 The First time I saw this film in 1986. It bothered me for day I couldn't shake the feeling it left me with. 14 years later it's just as moving. Christopher Walken and Sean Penn are simply amazing as a father and son who have never known each other and only truly know each other after it is far to late for Penn's character to save himself or anyone else. Walken Plays Brad Whitewood Sr. A Career criminal in a small town Sean Penn Plays Brad Jr a nobody trying to become somebody and win his fathers approval at the same time. The result is disasterous. The film is beautifully photographed and directed by James Foley who also directed the brilliant "After Dark My Sweet". So if your looking for a film that you'll be talking about days after you've seen it. This is it.
