 Forget everything after this, If you like Rodney Dangerfield this is the only movie you need to own it gets funnier evrytime you see it. Rodney and Joe Pesci are hilarious as the try to keep Rodney on the straight and  narrow so he doesn't lose his inheritance. The Movie started the  "Regular Guy Look" if you've seen this film you know what it is  if you don't, check it out and you will be sporting that look. Excellent  performances all around.
