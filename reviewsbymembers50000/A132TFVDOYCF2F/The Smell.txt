 Hey What's that smell? Oh I know it's another rotten knockoff of Silence of the Lambs.  Now I'd like to start by saying the Effects are all that make this movie watchable, and that grows pretty tiresome by the 90 min mark. The story is pretty basic. The acting for the most part is uniformly BAD. Jennifer Lopez and her whisper are growing mighty tiresome, And what happened to Vince Vaughn?.......  I can only recommend this movie if you can smoke a Fatty And enjoy the imagary. If not skip it and Rent the Much Superior Collecters Edition of 7, or The Criterion Collection Version of Silence of the Lambs.
