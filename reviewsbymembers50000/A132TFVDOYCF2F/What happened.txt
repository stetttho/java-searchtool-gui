 I don't understand what went wrong with this movie. You take a really talented cast a very funny premise and you come up with this.  Mona Dearly was hated by all. Everyone has a motive, But it's not that hard to figure  out Who really did it. With all of the characters this could have been a  lot more fun. The ending is absolutly tacked on as if to say it was reshot  later and tacked on to try to save a confusing mess, Which isn't that  confusing. All in all Drowning Mona Is not Terrible but a huge  dissapointment. The Disc itself has some good extra stuff,but wouldn't it  be nice to say that about the film?
