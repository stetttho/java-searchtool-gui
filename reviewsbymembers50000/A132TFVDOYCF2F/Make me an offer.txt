 I give this Dvd 4 stars total. Both films are entertaining with "Terror Tract" Being just a little better.  "Terror Tract"  is kinda similar to Cat's Eye. While Cherry Falls is more along the Scream / Urban legend kind of teen horror. The sound and Picture are first rate and the price is great. If you like horror get this twin billing it's defiantly worth 14 bucks.
