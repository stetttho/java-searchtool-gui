 Probably the most overrated films of 1997. I watched this film with various degrees of interest. The acting was for the most part flat and uninvolving and the writing a little smug. I really believe that the ending  was a series of ides written on scraps of paper,thrown in a hat pulled out  and shot in sequence. Chasing Amy a criterion collection Dvd? No it should  be part of a giveaway Buy Mallrats get  a copy of Chasing Amy.
