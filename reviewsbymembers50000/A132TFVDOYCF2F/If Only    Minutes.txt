 I wish this film were only 15 minutes long because then I wouldn't be writing this. This Movie Is  Really BAD!  First off the acting is pretty terrible the Two Russians. Oh excuse me One Czech and one Russian Either way they both suck. One dimensional,scene chewers that they are they look like Oscar winners next to Ed Burns. How does this guy continue to work?  He is unwatchable.  I give this film Two Stars 1 for Robert Deniro Who is lucky enough to check out earl if you know what I mean. No big Surpise, and 1 star for Kelsey Grammer who does a nice turn as sleazy talkshow host.  If you have to see this movie. do it while you're cleaning you cat box or peel dead skin off of your feet or some other really exciting task you've been putting off. This way you will not completly waste two hours like I did.
