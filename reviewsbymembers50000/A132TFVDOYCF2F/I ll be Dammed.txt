 I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I finished Propecy III. The story for the first time in the series was actually easy to follow.Walken was Great as Gabriel he always seems to approach these roles very tongue in  cheek, none more than this one. The picture and sound quality are both  adequate. Although to many previews for upcoming Dvd's and no extras will  keep me from buying it. I think some commentary from Walken would have been  a selling point.
