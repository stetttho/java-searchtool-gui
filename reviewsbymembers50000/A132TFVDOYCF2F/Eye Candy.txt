 I didn't think this film was going to hold my interest the way it did.  The story centers on two Brothers Vincent And Clay, One White and one Black. When Vincent Sets up Clay for their fathers murder,but botches the job, Clay is then thrown into the world of wealth and fame as he is now thought to be Vincent.  Without giving anymore away. I will say that this film is beautifully photographed in black and white which adds to the overall effectiveness of the film  I give this film a 3 1/2 star rating.   Check it out if you are tired of the run of the mill action fare
