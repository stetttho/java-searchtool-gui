 First of all I'd like to say this is not a great film It is a B movie but it is a very entertaining B movie. It is full of great performances Alexis Arquette has never been better. Scott Leet is perfect as Ray Frye The Convict who gets a second chance at life after spending seven years in the joint for Manslaughter . Now out of jail and back on the street Ray is looking to redeem himself somehow, while being endlessly hounded By Two cops (Mickey Rourke,Peter Green). Ray hooks up with Arquette who gives him a job and a place to live. There Ray meets and falls in love with Arquette's Lovely and lonely wife played by (Nina Ofenbok) Before you know it Ray is tangled in a web of murder and mystrey. They're are several Great Cameos, Ed Lauter , Christina Applegate And Balthazar Getty.
