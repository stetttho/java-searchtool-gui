 I really wanted to like this movie, But I couldn't bring myself to say anything positive about the movie.The acting the direction and the computerized sharks had me reaching for the remote. I am a huge fan of Jaws  and I know it is really unfair to compare the two films, But I'll take the  rubber shark over BAD CGI any day of the week. The disc on the other hand  is loaded with extras and looks and sounds great. So I give the Film 1 star  and the Dvd 4 stars. If I were you i'd spare yourself the agony of watching  the film and wait for Jaws to be released in July. You'll be a lot happier.
