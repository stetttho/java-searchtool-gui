 What is with the end of the film? Is it a joke? Is Depp you know who? The  first 2/3 of the movie are as good as anything Polanski has ever done,but  the ending, What's up? If someone can explain it to me I'd give it another  1/2 star. The acting is for the most part is excellent,especially Lena Olin  and Frank Langella. The Transfer is flawless The Dvd Looks and sounds  great. The extras are a plus.
