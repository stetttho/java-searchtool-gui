 Hamlet set in the sleazy underworld of L.A. I saw half of  this on cable and thought what the hell, So I bought it and was pleasantly surprised. The Acting is Top notch, Great Character actors Maury Chaukin,Phillip Baker Hall. and Mary Louise Parker all do a fine job. The Alas poor Yorik Scene works really Well.  So if you like contemporary updates of the Bards work.  Check this one out. 3 and 1/2 stars.
