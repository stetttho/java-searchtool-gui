 This movie is bad. Now that having been said, This movie Rocks, Jon Voight is so damn funny i almost cry from laughing at him. The snake looks so fake all involved in the making of the film should run and hide in a cave,Yet  somehow it all works as an entertaing if not credible film.This is what  Deep Blue Sea should have tried to become once they saw the first week of  dailies. Too bad Renny Harlin doesn't have a sense of humor.
