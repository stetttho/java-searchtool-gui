 Simply put a great film. This in my opinion is the best film of it's kind ever made. The performances are all top notch.Steve Zahn almost steals the film as Glen the stoner who almost blows it for Jack Foley and Buddy. Smart  dialog adapted by Scott Frank from the Elmore leonard novel.Lopez has never  been better. The Disc is loaded with extras.It is definatly worth the price  of admission. Buy It!
