 Not horrible, Truly original, But BORING... I was very excited to see this film and wanted to like it, But it was so BORING. I usually like John Cusack and Cameron Diaz, And like them I did.  BORING. Did I mention the  film was BORING. Definatly not the best of 1999. Maybe I was expecting to  much. Different it was Entertaing sometimes, But always BORING
