 Add this to your collection. Though not as scary as the original, this movie is out there and great in it's own way. It picks up 15 years after  the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Dennis Hopper Plays the Uncle of Sally  and Franklin two of the Kids who were killed in the Original. So much for  the Plot. The Sets and the sheer lunacy make this film stand on it's own.  The Showdown between Hopper and the Family of Freaks will have you in  stiches. The Dvd is rather bland no extras really. The Picture and sound  quality are A quality. If your a horror fan. Check it out.
