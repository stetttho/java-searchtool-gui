 The Coca-Cola Kid gets by on it's off-beat charm of which it is loaded with. Eric Roberts is Perfect as Becker the hotshot trouble shooter who comes to bring coca-cola to the outback. Along the way he becomes a better person as he encounters a local soft drink makerwho refuses to be pushed aside by the American giant.  Greta Scacci plays Beckers love interest who has a few secrets of her own. Yes it is compareable to "Local Hero" but is original enough to stand on it's own. One of Roberts better performances.
