 Talk all you want about the blair witch project. If you are looking for a really scary movie this is it. Although shot in 1974 which seems like a million years ago the film is still very disturbing. This was my first  viewing in nearly 15 years and it was a hell of a lot better than I  remembered. No CGI no special effects no cheap thrills This movie is an all  out assault on your senses and well worth it. The Dvd has some great extras  definatly worth buying. For fans only
