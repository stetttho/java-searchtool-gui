 What a piece of work this is. Watching George Clooney run around with long hair and pretend to be a drug runner? Come on... No wonder this movie never recieved a theatrical release.Bad acting lighting and really bad camera  work sink this shipwreck. To bad the tides couldn't have washed this film  out to sea.
