 Ginger Snaps is one of the best teen horror movies of the past 20 years, After being force fed dreck like the (Scream Trilogy) and the (Last Summer )films it was refreshing to see a clever and truley blood soaked gorefest. This film does not go for the cheap hip laughs while compromizing the sheer terror that horror fans should  expect. The Acting is all first rate, The effects are Plentiful and pretty realistic NO CGI, Thank God. So if you are a fan of  The Howling, American Werewolf in London, or John Carpenters The Thing. Then check this out. I heard there is a Collecters edition of this in the works.  Including a Widescreen version, directors commentary, And some new scenes.
