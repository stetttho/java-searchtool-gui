 One of the funniest most twisted films ever made. This film is truley remarkable for it's intertwinings of absolutly everyone who comes onto the screen. Words can not do justice to this film. Just rent it you will either LOVE IT or you will HATE IT. There is no middle ground. I think this is Scorsese's masterpiece.  I can't say enough about this film. Griffen Dunne is amazing. See it NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
