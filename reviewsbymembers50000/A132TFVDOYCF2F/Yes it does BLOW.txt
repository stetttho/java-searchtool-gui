 This movie is the worst of it's type to date. More a series of classic rock music videos strung together than anything else, It never pulls you into the world it is trying to create. Donnie Brasco, Goodfellas, even Godfather III. Make this a film I think Johnny Depp should probably try and buy all copies and burn. Get the soundtrack instead. Long and boring non-involving, bad acting and bad wigs make this truly unwatchable.
