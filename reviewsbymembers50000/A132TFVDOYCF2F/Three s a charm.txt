 This follow up to (Out of Sight) is Actually the third of what I like to call The Soderberg Triology.This film along with (The Underneath) and(Out of Sight) Prove that Soderberg has no equal in this genre. The Limey is a  smart thriller with two brilliant performances at it's core. Terrence Stamp  was unjustly overlooked during the Oscar nominations.Brilliant I say. The  Disc is of the highest quality.The Commentary is very insightful and quite  entertaining. If you like This Genre this is the disc for you.
