 Okay let me start by saying this movie does not take itself seriously. Whew! Too many times a film of this kind can't quite figure out what it wants to be. Not a problem here. It's all tounge and cheek . William Zabka(The bully from the Karate Kid  and Just one of the Guys) Plays Deputy Greg, a Small town Deputy Sherrif Who just never left town to become that hotshot FBI agent. He's got bigger problems, seems a military flight carring a VERY LARGE and VERY HUNGARY  Experimental Snake has gone down in the woods surrounding the small town of Ruby. The rest as they say is history.  Robert England and Casper Van Dien also show up to hunt the Great and Hungary Beast The Dvd itself has some nice extras and a great 3D Menu. It looks and sounds great.  If you liked Anaconda you'll like Python.
