 Gene Hackman is surely one of the greatest living actors. Even in a film  like Narrow Margin, Hackman rises above the material. The Plot - Woman sees  murder, Woman flees. Hackman tracks her down and must bring her back to  testify. The Twist is it all takes place on a train. The tension is so  thick you can cut it with a knife. Hackmans character is a tough guy in the  best sense of the word, not like a Stallone or a Swartzenegger character.  We see and Feel Hackmans pain. Anne Archer is also fine as the Woman in  question. Also with J.T and  M.Emmett Walsh,And James B Seking. The Dvd has  no extras but for the price it's not bad.
