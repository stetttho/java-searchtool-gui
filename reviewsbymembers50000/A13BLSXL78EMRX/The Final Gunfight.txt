 In 1969, during the turbulent revolution of Mexico, amid the vanishing decade of the Gunfighter, master filmmaker Sam Peckinpah, created a masterpiece. Assembling what has been described as the most notable group of western actors of the period, namely William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, and Jamie Sanchez, otherwise known as The Wild Bunch, Peckinpah enshrined their epitaph on the silver screen forever. Daring to epitomized the final years of a group of aging outlaws, he created a most virulent, action packed and certainly destructive episode of an fading era. The story is that of a band of gunfighters looking for one final score, which would lead to their retirement. Instead, the deeds of their past pursue them into a final explosive confrontation with lawmen, bounty-hunters, and revolutionary Jurastias. What transpires in the final explosive minutes of the film creates such pistol packing, bullet tearing and machine gun ripping scenes as to numb the viewer's mind. It will become unforgettable and certainly most memorable as to compare all future western film to this one. A more fitting tribute to the gunfighter, there never was. A superb film if ever there was one. *****
