 In 16th century Europe, in a play entitled The Merchant of Venice, a young man (Joseph Fiennes) wishes to compete for the hand of a beautiful woman, named Portia. To do this, he needs money of which he is woefully absent of. Asking his best friend Antonio (Jeremy Irons), for the sum, he learns he too is short of funds, but is willing to risks his name and credit with a short term loan from a Jewish money lender named Shylock. (Al Pacino) In my opinion, this is one of his finest and most superb performances in his illustrious career. Despite the fact Bassino wins the hand of his intended, his friend Antonio falls prey to the vengeful and vindictive hatred of money grubbing Shylock who is hell bent on getting his "Pound of Flesh" in the courts of Venice. The court room scene is drama at it's very best. Pacino's performance and Irons' reaction is theater at its finest. There are many versions of this Shakespeare play, but with Pacino, Irons and Fiennes it becomes a masterpiece. *****
