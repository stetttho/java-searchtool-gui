 To movie goers everywhere, the remake of a classic film has always been one of colossal disappointment. The film King Kong which originated in the 1930's has stood the test of time. In 1976, a remake was offered with Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lang. However, despite Bridges' enormous talent, the film itself fell well short of the mark. In the original it was Robert Armstrong, Fay Wray and Bruce Cabot who challenged the might of King Kong. In this new version, director Peter Jackson combines the talents of Jack Black as Carl Denham, Naomi Watts, as Ann Darrow and Adrian Brody as the hero against the Eight Wonder of the World. Asides from the fantastic new animatronic scenes which adds towering adventure and blood curling excitement, the real 'special' effect to this new version is King Kong himself. Adroitly brought to life by Andy Serkis, the giant ape not only displays unbridled power, explosive terror, but a deep sympathetic quality which elicits long over due admiration for the creature. So much so, one wishes the ending would not finish like the original. All in all, this remake is truly a welcomed contender to the original, earning the director and his cast enormous applause for a film which not only hit it's mark, but does so with fulsome praise from audiences everywhere. Well done! *****
