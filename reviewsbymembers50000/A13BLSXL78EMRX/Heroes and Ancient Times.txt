 Achilles was known as the immortal created by the dark waters of the river Styx. His heroic story reverberates across the centuries and is illuminated in the film, TROY. Director Wolfgang Petersen draws well on his extensive talent and has created an enormous masterpiece for audiences for years to come. Combining the enormous talents of such notables as Peter O'Toole, Eric Bana, Brian Cox, and Orlando Bloom the setting awakens with true panorama of both spectacle and historical value. The few flaws wound within the beautiful tapestry of the film are only apparent to those who have any knowledge of the works of Homer or studied classic antiquity. The most obvious is the intimate relationship between Achilles and his lover Patroclus. Also noticeable is the Spartan soldiers allowing women at their feast instead of their traditional partners. Other minor flaws consist of squeezing the ten year siege war into the space of two hours and of course, for the more aesthetic among us, the unattractive "Trojan Horse." Nonetheless, the spectacular, panoramic fight scenes are impressive and magnificent. A classic film if ever there was one. ****
