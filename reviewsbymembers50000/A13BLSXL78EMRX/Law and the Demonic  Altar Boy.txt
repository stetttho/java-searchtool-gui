 The life of an altar boy is not an easy one. Worse, when the altar boy has been sexually abused, the anger embedded is deep and dark. Years later when the boy has grown to adulthood and can retaliate against the abuser, the black fury of the past results in a gruesome, violent murder. Thus the premise of Primal Fear is realized in the film of the same name. Richard Gere plays Martin Vail an attorney with superb legal abilities and an inflated ego. However, the motivating power of the movie emanates primarily from the demon plagued Aaron Stampler, superbly played by new comer Edward Norton. The heinous murder of an archbishop sets the stage for a media swamped sensational trial in which the prosecutor seeks the death penalty and the defense tries to explain how two distinct personalities exist within the torturous soul of the young man accused of the crime. Still, a very subtle and unsuspecting nuance snakes itself into the story line, like a threatening viper and if not detected will strike your soul as does the film's conclusion. Great movie and superior acting makes for a worthwhile reason to watch this film. ***
