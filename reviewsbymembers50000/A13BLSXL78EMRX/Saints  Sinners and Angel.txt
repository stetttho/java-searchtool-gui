 A Catholic school setting is the visual arena where-in director and writer, Pedro Almodovar, depicts his story of the troubled lives of two former school boys adroitly played by Gael Bernal and Fele Martnez with Daniel Cacho as Padre Manolo. In the 1970's an ambitious and somewhat avarice young man, having survived an unholy education at the hands of a hedonistic priest devises an elaborate scheme to blackmail him for a large sum of money. Recalling the unsolicited sexual advances and preteen experiences wrought upon him by his confessor father, he blatantly confronts the priest with his demands. His painful, literal memories are encapsulated in a manuscript entitled 'the visit' which have devastating implications for the priest, should they become grist for the media. Unaware to the priest, the visitor and blackmailer is not whom he seems, nor is he the only victim. The story snares both friend and foe alike within the twisting scheme which involves romantic betrayal, sexual themes and unfulfilled ambitions. In the end, the victor is the least likely to have counted on the outcome. All in all, a voracious screen triumph for both cast and director alike. Mild nudity adds to the visual images. *****
