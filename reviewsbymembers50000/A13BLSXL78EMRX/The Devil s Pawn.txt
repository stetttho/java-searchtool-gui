 The Medusa Touch is the fantastic story of a middle age English man tormented by the terrifying revelation, he is responsible for the the world's disasters. Richard Burton gives an unforgetable performance as writer John Morlar, who is brutally murdered and left for dead. Trouble is, his mind refuses to die. Convinced, from a young age, Morlar believes he has had the power to cause personal as well as world catastrophes. To prove his point, he snares a fully-loaded flying 747 jumbo jet and causes it to crash into a high rise apartment building, killing hundreds. The case is investigated by French Inspector Brunel(Supurbly played by Lino Ventura) who is convinced, Morlar's personal psychiatrist, Doctor Zonfeld (Lee Remick in one of her finest roles), is harboring a horrifying secret which eventually engulfs them both. The film is a masterpiece, combining the attributes of in your seat suspense and visual scenes which are further enhanced by a haunting musical score. With veteran actors like Harry Andrews, Alan Badel, Michael Hordern, and Derek Jacobi, the movie becomes a classic drama of unparalleled achievement. *****
