 Selecting the final segment in the life of author Truman Capote, the film "Capote", delves into the inner and certainly troubled soul of the American Novelist. The film itself, is a somber reflection of the price Capote paid to write what appears to be his most poignant work. The introduction of the book and the movie itself invites the audience into the real life drama of the Kansas family who were brutally murdered by two killers named Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins) in 1963. Along the way, one observes how adroitly, the writer is able to weave his tapestry between truth and fiction to achieve his ultimate goal. With the help of an assortment of great actors, such as Bruce Greenwood (Jack Dunphy) and Chris Cooper, Alvin Dewey) the film exhibits the enormous talent, and human flaws which made Capote a household word. Like an excellent novel, the movie is slow to build, but eventually achieves a touching tribute to the man.   This is your comment, you may delete or edit it.
