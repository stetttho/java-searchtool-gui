 Taking the classic children's story of "Chicken Little" by E.L.Easton and converting it into a visual treat for all ages, the Walt Disneys' studios has laid a golden egg. The talented voice of LaZach Braff as the voice of Chicken Little, is further enhanced by Garry Marshall as Buck Cluck, and the late Don Knotts as Mayor Turkey Lurkey, and even Patrick Steward bring to life the memorable children's story. The tale itself is of a little chicken who having been struck in the head by falling debris, is convinced the sky is indeed falling and runs about hysterically warning everyone throughout the town. Unlike the tragic ending in the popular book, the film version is colorful, comical and light hearted. A film for the enjoyment of both children and adults which lives up to parents' expectations of wholesome entertainment. **
