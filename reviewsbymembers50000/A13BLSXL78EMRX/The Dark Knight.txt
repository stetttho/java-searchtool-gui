 When the brilliant writer Bob Kane first created the Dark Knight of Gothom City in the 1930s, I'm sure one of his after thoughts was to picture his Dark Avenger in a live action movie. The dream has become fact in "Batman, the beginning." After viewing it, my first impression is, WOW! The film is a great combination of humanistic philosophy, explosive action, menacing criminals, and an excellent script with talented actors. Crafted in the mind of originator Bob Kane, his Capped Crusader rises from the panels of DC Comics and explodes onto the big screen with all the force of a true classic. As Par for the course, director Christopher Nolan has conscripted the superb performing talents of Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, and Michael Caine as Alfred. All in all, I encourage all viewers to prepare themselves for a action crammed film of legendary characters,explosive scenes and cinematic history
