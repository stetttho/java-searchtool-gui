   The world of imagination as created by Sir James Matthew Barrie is solidly entrenched in both children books and in films such as "Finding Neverland." Viewing the superb acting talents of Johnny Depp, portraying the 19th century English writer J. M. Berrie, is tantamount to watching a great artist at work. The film laces Barrie's life before, during and after meeting his wife Kate Winslet, with the Victorian views of the day. What is glossed over or at the very least dissipated by the delicate film are the circulating rumors, societal suspicions and vicious gossip regarding Mr. Barries' real reason for marrying the matron widow and her attractive family. The film proves witty, incisive and stocked with family values seldom found in other movies. Anyone seeking a glimpse of turn-of-the-century England will enjoy Depp's performance as he reveals the inspirational origins for his memorable story of Peter Pan. **
