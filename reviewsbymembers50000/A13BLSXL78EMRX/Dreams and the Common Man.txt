 There is very little that a determined individual cannot do. Cinderella Man is a case in point. Thought of as an 'over-the-hill' boxer, the fanciful story of James Braddock (adroitly played by Russell Crowe) is a movie which should be seen by anyone who needs a second chance in life. Director Ron Howard has revealed once again that his talent for encouraging actors to perform at their peak is still evident. The film itself is occasionally enhanced by tragic emotional segments which tends to argument the action sequences, but not so much as to diminish the overall structure of the movie. All in all, Crowe and his co-stars, Renee Zellweger, Paul Giamatti and Craig Bierko offer a remarkable segment out of the famous boxer's life and creates a landmark of excitement and entertainment destined to please audiences for generations to come. A fun and compassionate film for those with heart. ***
