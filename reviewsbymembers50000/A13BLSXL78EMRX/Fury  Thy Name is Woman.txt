 Baise-Moi is the story of an unlikely pair of discarded women who live life as mundane as anyone else. Yet their world is soon shattered by a gang rape which not only activates their pent-up frustrations and seething rage, but also shatters the bounds of taste and acceptability. What limits the film industry has establish, this dark film tears open with such graphic and violent scenes as to leave the viewer gasping for breath. Using actual porn actresses for their heroes, directors Virginie Despentes and Coralie, within the context of their film, they are able to integrate actual, factual sex scenes, which border on the pornographic. As a result, they unleash such explosive and virulent power which explodes with such rampant destruction as to illicit either excitement or revulsion in every viewer. In the context as Natural Born Killers and Thalma and Louise, Baise-Moi establishes for itself a true classical niche in the expanding genera of dramatic films.
