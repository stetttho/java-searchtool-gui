 Wars have always been an integral part of humanity's suicidal efforts to destroy itself. In the film, Lord of War, Nicolas Cage, plays Yuri Orlov, who's weapons, allow the process of death and mass murder to become an art form. The film is unapologetic and quite brutal as are the actors who portray the various waring dictators, soldiers and merchants of death participating in the gun-trade. Following his transformation from drug pusher to arms dealer, Yuri displays a genius for circumventing international law and becomes an expert at delivering death to any infant nation struggling for survival around the world. Chased by a persistent Federal agent from the U.S., as well as inter-pol agents, the film is set to the background of various conflicts around the globe. The film is a social statement which reminds us, there are many nations who's leaders would rather prostitute their country's resources and the lives of their people, than establish a future for them. Cage is perfect as the soulless arms dealer who learns there is a personal price in becoming a pimp. **
