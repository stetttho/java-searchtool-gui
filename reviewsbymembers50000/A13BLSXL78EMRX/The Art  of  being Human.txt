 The time, 1940. The place, an idyllic island setting somewhere in the Atlantic. England transports a plane load of prim and proper, school boys away from the horrors of a European War. The plane crashes and the boys are left stranded on a tropical island without adult supervision. William Golding' novel allows viewers to observe the transformation of even the most well behaved children when left to their own devices. Innocent at first, the boys contrive a make-shift hierarchy based on English society and parental mores. Soon however, a subtle inclination allows the more aggressive side of human nature to evolve and a split divides the once tranquil group. What follows is the natural tendency of mankind to revert to a more primitive and prurient structure resulting in animal dominance, religious fears and murder. Disturbing in it's accusations and terrifying in it's imaginary, the Black and white version is definitely a superb classic by any standard. Brief nudity. ****
