  I have always been a fan of Michael Keaton. His acting is of such superior quality that as one watches him ply his trade, it's nearly magical. His specialty is that regardless of role, he proves believable and convincing. Such is the case with his new film, White Noise. In this role, he plays Jonathan Rivers, a happily married and successful architect, who after losing his wife is visited by those who study EVP or Electronic Voice Phenomena. Seeking some way to communicate with his deceased wife, he struggles to understand and accept the premises that the living can indeed communicate with the dead. The film, like the script is palatable enough, but hardly worthy of Keaton's superior talent. One actor in the film who does enter a surprising performance is Raymond Price who plays Ian McNeice. However, the film itself falls short of conviction and therefore regulated to mediocrity. **
