 From the fertile, creative mind of fiction writer Frank Miller, arrives this powerful new comic-book turned movie entitled Sin City. The film itself contains the rare but measured ingredients of a true classic comic. What the viewer discovers is a crimson colored, black and white film jam packed with live action, special effect and and electrically charged 1950's comic drama from beginning to end. The extraordinary and exciting talents of Bruce Willis, Powers Booth, Michael C. Duncan and Rutger Hauer are further enhanced with the surprising, psychotic appearance of Elijah Wood as an super powered nearly unstoppable maniac. If this combination is not enough, there is yet, one other surprising feature in Sin City which nearly steals the show from all the other actors. This is the superb acting, extraordinary ability and super makeup of the multi-talented Mickey Rourke. Directing this fantastic assemblage of fine actors is multi-talented Robert Rodriguez, who has created in the words of this reviewer, a Cult Classic which will endure far into the future of films.
