 The movie War of the Worlds, (2005) is a case study of a dysfunctional family under fire. Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) plays a stevedore who returns home one day to greet his estranged wife, her new husband, his rebellious teenage son, a banshee-screaming daughter and invading Martians. Despite the explosive eruption, colossal growth, murderous rampage and vaporous populous, Ray reacts curiously as beings from Mars emerge to, destroy his city and systematically set out to conquer the world. Inhibiting clear thinking is his protective attitude, his chiding son who lambaste his father for personal failures, and his terrified daughter who's irritating screams prevent planning and implementation. The movie attempts to bring to life the classic novel by H. G. Wells and in many ways succeeds. However, Spielberg spent so much time on the bickering family, that he left the audience straining to see the cataclysmic confrontation between Earth's forces and the gigantic Tri-pod Martains, over the shoulders of Cruise and his problems. The original 1957 version had Gene Barry as a scientist and the audience easily followed him. In this version, Cruise is a common man who's innate curiosity becomes a hindrance. In addition, the great talent of Tim Robbins is wasted as a crazed survivor. In conclusion, the original had direction, the new version is hampered with family ties. Except for a few exceptional scenes, the film failed to live up to the original. ***
