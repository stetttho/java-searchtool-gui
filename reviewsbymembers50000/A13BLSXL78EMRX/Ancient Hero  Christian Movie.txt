 Oliver Stone has created an extraordinary classic with his film Alexander. Taken from the works of dozen of writers, his epic is the finest composite of the mythic hero as could be fashioned. Once completed, the film must now survive the gauntlet of criticisms, opinions and censorship. Although the story is as factual as could be put to cellulose, many historical inaccuracies appear. Still the result is incredible. The selection of Colin Farrell, Connor Paolo and Jessie Kamm, as Alexander prove inspirational. A host of notables, such as Anthony Hopkins, Brian Blessed, Christopher Plummer and Val Kilmer proliferate the historical saga with Angelina Jolie and Francisco Bosch whose handsome features adds legendary beauty to the masterpiece. Opting not to incur the wrath of Christian Hollywood, Stone allows ancient Hellenic boys who wrestled in the nude to wear loin cloths in the Greek gym and plays down the homosexual angle between Alexander and Hephaiston, for the romantic adore and a single kiss with the Persian Boy, Bagoas. A scene which got the film banned, in of all places, Greece. Nevertheless, the great scope of the battle sequences and fine casting and the beauty of the ancient world, combine to create a true classic. ****
