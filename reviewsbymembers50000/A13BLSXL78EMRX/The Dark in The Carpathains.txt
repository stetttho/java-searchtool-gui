 After a famous European scientist discovers a medieval cave deep in the Carpathian Mountains which promises to yield exciting new evidence of unusual underwater life forms, he sends for a team of scuba experts played by Cole Hauser and Eddie Cibrian. They in turn assemble their experienced teams who also happen to be expert climbers and spelunkers. Reaching the area, they begin exploring the dark depths and soon become prey to carnivorous creatures which date back to the Crusades. Although there is much to be said for the action oriented film, lacking is the sympathetic cohesion which allows audiences to identify with any particular character. Still the underwater drama and some rather terrifying moments in the underground labyrinth makes for an enjoyable movie. ***
