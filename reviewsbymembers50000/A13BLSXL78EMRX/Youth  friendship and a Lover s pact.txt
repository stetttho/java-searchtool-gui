 Director Michael Mayer and screen writer Michael Cunningham combined their formidable talents to create an emotional masterpiece which is seldom found in the world of film. This is the tearful story of Young Bobby Morrow (supurbly played by Andrew Chalmer) who is untimely separated from his older brother, but discovers that he is gifted with supreme insight. With it, he establishes a loving and emotional foundation with both his lifetime,companion (Harris Allan) and their triadic lover Sissy Spacek. From his early boyhood days when Love could be found in a kiss or shared at arm length, to the countryside estate which allows him to fulfill his fanciful dreams, the touching story is supremely crafted to illicit the most heart wrenching emotions and delightfully delivers hope and love as a divided. If the viewer possesses a heart, this film will touch it.
