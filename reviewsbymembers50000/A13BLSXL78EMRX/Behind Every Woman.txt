 The Constant Gardner is an extremely surprising film in which Ralph Fiennes takes the life of Justin Quayle and blends it into the globe-trotting secrets of his spouse, played by Rachel Weisz. The wife herself is on a secretive high speed mission to expose the deadly pharmaceutical business and uncaring corporations out to make millions on the bodies of dead Africans. With the wife surreptitious and "Accidently" removed from meddling into the affairs of their company, upper management believes that sufficient monies will keep the soft spoken and laid back life style husband out of their affairs. They are mistaken. Instead of holding him in place, all efforts by the corporations are unleashed when they learn that Justin will not rest until he exposes his wife's killers. Action based and moralistically implied, the film earned high praise for it's sympathetic approach to the plight of millions of starving and dying Africans. A surprising performance is offered by the extremely talented Pete Postlethwaite as Doctor Brandt. ***
