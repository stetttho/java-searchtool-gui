 In the film "What's Eating Gilbert Grape", anyone who has been cursed with a common family, will find a deep kinship with Johnny Depp. Playing Gilbert Grape, Depp does an admirable job of sustaining a sympathetic role for himself and his retarded brother, played equally superb by Leonardo DiCaprio. Included among his additional sufferings Gilbert must endure is his obese mother, who blames her huge weight problem on her husband's death. His two sisters add to his burden as does an unfaithful wife and traveling woman in a streamline trailer. Gilbert endures the given facts of his dull, uneventful and nondescript life with seemingly limitless patience. He further accepts the troubling circumstances of his half-wit brother who persistently seeks the summits of a city water tower. His world drifts from tedium to tedium until finally it explodes with an unexpected but understandable rage. Somewhere in the aftermath, Gilbert discovers a renewed compassion, a soul saving reason for continuing his existence and the dark root of his mother's weighty affliction. Gilbert saves her humiliation with a modicum of dignity. Regrets are forgotten, life must go on. **
