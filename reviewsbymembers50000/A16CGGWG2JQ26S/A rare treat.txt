 Bach's Magnificat, written to a Latin canticle Magnificat anima mea Dominum, occupied the composer's mind for about 5 years.  The first version was written following Bach's appointment as cantor at St Thomas' in  Leipzig.  The original key was e-flat, and the work's dedication to the  celebration of Christmas was very evident (it was first performed at the  Christmas vigil in 1723).  After a number of transformations, the final  version, which is presented on this disc, adopted the key of d-major and  dropped the obvious Christmas interpolations - in this form Magnificat  became suitable to any church occasion.  Incidentally, the original version  of Magnificat is available from New London Consort under Philip Pickett,  L'Oiseau Lyre 452 920-2.  Pickett's magic doesn't quite work in that  recording, but the AT duet "Et misericordia ejus" (Robson/Agnew)  is a real winner.  This duet is a show-stopper on the Herreweghe as well,  stunningly sung by Lesne and Crook.  "Esurientis" is also  magnificent (forgive me for being a bit one-sided, I'm a fan of male  altos).  Magnificat is, in essence, a cycle of arias: Bach dispenses with  recitative, and reintroduces the thematic material from the beginning of  the work in its final chorus.  Herreweghe's sensitive direction highlights  the structural elegance and humanity of this piece.  The CD also contains  BWV 80, a return to German Lutheran music.  This piece is noteworthy for  its incorporation of four verses from Psalm 46 paraphrased and set to  melody by Luther himself. gkolomietz@yahoo.com
