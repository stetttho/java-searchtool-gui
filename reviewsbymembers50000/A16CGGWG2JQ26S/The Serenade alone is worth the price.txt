 As an incorrigible "voice-freak," I admit I bought this CD for Bostridge.  One of these days I will learn to appreciate the horn concertos too, but for now all I play on this CD is Britten's Serenade.  I also have  this composition in the performance of the magnificent Peter Pears, for  whom it was written, and what a worthy heir to Pears Bostridge is!  Their  voices are beguilingly alike, but there is enough individuality in each  performance to cherish them both.  The voice of Pears was more robust, and  the voice of Bostridge is more fluid, more gentle by comparison.  What I  find the most remarkable about Bostridge is his ability to combine this  fluidity of tone with an almost declamatory clarity of expression.  His  intonation is superb.
