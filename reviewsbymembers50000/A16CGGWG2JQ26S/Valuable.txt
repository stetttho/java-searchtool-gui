 The Old Hall Manuscript is a major source of the 15th century English  sacred music.  The selection of works from this manuscript, presented on  this recording, follows the general layout adopted by the compilers of the  manuscript: first come the movements from the mass ordinary in their  logical sequence (Gloria, Credo, Sanctus and Agnus), interpolated with  liturgical antiphons, then come the settings of the last response - Deo  Gratias.  In addition, to make the source of plainchant in several  antiphons more clear, the Hilliard included four plainsong melodies  directly in front of the antiphons.  This recording is extremely valuable  because it brings back from oblivion many wonderful works with which the  listener is not likely to be familiar.  The Hilliard sing these pieces with  crisp clarity and energetic tempi.  My favorite pieces are Pycard's Gloria  , a queue of rapid imitative entries, fortified by the use of three equal  voices (tenors); and Anon. Agnus Dei (track 21), an example of the style  called English Discant (in its simplest form, a plainsong melody in one of  the voices, harmonized note for note in the other voices).  Recorded in  1990, this is the last Hilliard recording still featuring their founder -  the wonderful baritone Paul Hillier.
