 This was a surprise recording for me.  I've never considered McCreesh to be an opera conductor.  Not that I'm a major expert, but I do own a number of his recordings, and I've always thought of him as a conductor most  celebrated for his liturgical performances.  Well, it turns out that the  familiar McCreesh is equally at home in opera as in liturgy.  In fact, come  to think of it, McCreesh's extroverted ("congregational")  renditions of church music made him just the conductor to tackle the drama  of opera.  His expressive conducting elicits the best out of each  performer.  And what a cast!  Andreas Scholl turns in a wonderful  performance as Solomon.  I'm one of those people who sometimes find  Scholl's singing to be beautiful without passion.  But no such charge can  be levelled against him here.  His beatiful tone is combined with excellent  phrasing, aided by McCreesh's judiciouly chosen tempi.  I think this is one  of Scholl's best performances on disc.  Incidentally, I'm happy that  McCreesh opted for a countertenor in the role of Solomon - I'm really not a  fan of women in "pants" roles.  Two other singers clearly stand  out: Paul Agnew as Zadok (one of my two favorite tenors, if anybody cares)  and Peter Harvey as a Levite.  Luckily, Agnew's Zadok has more to sing that  Zadok on the Gardiner.  In Agnew's magnificent performance, no one can  claim that some of the arias he gets to sing are the proverbial  "deadwood!"  The female singers, especially the bright-voiced  Susan Gritton, are also memorable.  Bravo, Paul McCreesh!
