 As a rare one-voice-per-part recording (OVPP), this is a milestone in the history of Bach performances.  The close recorded sound will not be to everyone's liking (BBC Music certainly didn't appreciate this aspect of the  recording), but as Matthew Westphal's glowing review suggests, not  everybody will find it objectionable either.  I greatly respect Westphal's  insightful comments, so when a friend forwarded me Westphal's e-mail  suggesting other OVPP recordings of Bach, I went out and bought most of  them.  The comparison gave me a new perspective on this recording.  I had  bought this recording for the soloists, without knowing anything about the  raging OVPP debate (both Gramophone and BBC Music have recently featured  vigorous exchanges on the subject).  In fact, my first response to this  recording was incredulity.  I had heard OVPP performances of Renaissance  masses and Venetian vespers, but I had no idea that this approach could  also work in Bach.  Now, having heard a number of OVPP interpretations of  Bach, and having read the arguments in favor of the approach, I am a  convert.  As this recording demonstrates, performing Bach with solo voices  reveals hidden structural nuances and adds a more intimate dimension to the  genius of the score.  It also lets you enjoy the beautiful vocal timbres of  the individual soloists, if you're into that sort of thing.  In that  regard, this recording presents four voices about as beautiful as they get!   Their impressive vocal contributions, coupled with delightful instrumental  playing, make this recording a compelling testament to the merits of the  OVPP approach.  gkolomietz@yahoo.com
