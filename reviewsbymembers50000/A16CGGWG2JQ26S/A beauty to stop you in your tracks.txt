 I got this CD as a gift from Dan Taylor himself and he would be happy to know that it has become one of the most cherished CD's in my vast collection.  As much as I enjoyed Paul Agnew's wonderful recordings of  English lute songs, Taylor's raw sincerity and subdued eloquence in the  rendition of these songs probably surpass even Agnew's silken polish.  The  title line for my review comes from Gramophone, I just couldn't resist  borrowing it because it is so apt!  Most of the songs on this disc (in  fact, all but one) are plaintive and sentimental.  The choice is fitting  because the pure fluid tone of Taylor's voice seems ideally suited to slow  melodic lines such as these.  I find Taylor's voice to be absolutely  remarkable.  To my ears, it combines the platinum radiance of David Cordier  with the velvety opulence of Michael Chance - a rare combination indeed.   As if the beautiful voice was not enough to spark interest, Taylor's  singing here is also technically secure and lyrically expressive, ever so  lightly adorned with tasteful ornaments.  The emphases are all the more  potent because they are sparsely used.  For example, the second repetition  of "Learn to condemn light" in Flow my tears is startling in its  sudden roughness... I will never be able to listen to this song again in  anybody's performance without expecting them to repeat that same  modulation.  To me at least, this is how these songs should be sung.   gkolomietz@yahoo.com
