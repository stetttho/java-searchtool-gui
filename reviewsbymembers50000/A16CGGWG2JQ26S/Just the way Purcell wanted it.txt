 The first ode on this CD - Ye tuneful muses, was composed in 1686.  It combines several characteristical features of Purcell's style: vocal numbers over a ground bass followed by imitative choruses and string  ritornelli, and daringly low ranges for bass solos.  The ode even includes  an ingenious interpretation of a street song.  The presentation here, as on  the rest of the volumes in this series, is trim: the small numbers of  singers and instrumentalists are believed to be historically accurate.  The  next ode - Celestial music did the gods inspire - was commissioned in 1689  for the performance at one of London's schools (Dido and Aeneas was written  in the same year, but for a different school).  The best moment is the alto  solo accompanied by two recorders. The final ode - From hardy climes  (written to celebrate the marriage of the Prince of Denmark - is that a  "hardy clime?"), opens with a beautiful symphony, full of  inventive string writing.  Among several vocal solos is one of the most  beautiful Purcell melodies - The sparrow and the gentle dove, meltingly  sung by Charles Daniels.
