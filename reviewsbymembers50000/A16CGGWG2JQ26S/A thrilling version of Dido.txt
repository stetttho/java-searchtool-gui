 Since this is coming from William Christie, you won't be surprised to hear that this Dido is "frenchified."  No, not because most of the  singers are French - as the editorial review mentions, their English  pronunciation is generally quite admirable.  The reason I'm saying that  this version of Dido is frenchified is the stylistic choices made by  Christie, i.e. the presence of such French baroque features as  over-dotting, reverse dotting, inegalite, and Lully-esque  "agrements."  But you know what?  This just might be the way  Purcell wanted this work performed!  French influences on Purcell are well  known.  The interaction between French and English musical idioms is  evident from other examples as well (e.g., while the English never fully  shared the French aversion to castrati, no English boy was ever castrated,  and the need for high-pitched voices was filled domestically by boy  trebles, falsettists and high tenors).  So Christie's decision to produce  this lavishly embellished Dido is well within the ballpark of what we know  about the English aesthetics of Purcell's times.  This stylistic choice is  especially gratifying in Dido's final lament.  Christie approaches it with  a change of tempo - from brisk to almost dangerously slow - and the famous  lament unfolds with all the dramatic dignity and with all the stylistic  bells and whistles that can be packed into the slow pace.  The amazing  Veronique Gens executes the lament with heart-stopping embellishments -  runs, trills, turns, melismas, appogiaturas - trust me, once you hear THIS,  any other Dido will seem dull by comparison!  gkolomietz@yahoo.com
