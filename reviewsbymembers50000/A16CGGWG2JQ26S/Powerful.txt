 "The tears of St. Peter," an impressive cycle of 21 spiritual madrigals written to the poems by Luigi Tansillo, was Lassus' swangsong - he died just three weeks after dedicating the work to Pope Clement VII  (there exists a drawing of this event).  In this cycle, Lassus brought the  genre of madrigal to its perfection.  The music is uniquely suited to the  words - the cadences, rests, changes in the number of voices are calibrated  to reflect the semantics of the text; likewise, for the sake of the clarity  of expression, the music is freely composed: there are no repetitions or  digressions.  The spiritual import of the cycle is magnified by its  symbolism: 21 madrigals in 7 parts, yielding a no less symbolic number 3.   These connotations were intentional, since only 20 sections were written to  Tansillo's words.  The 21st section, added by Lassus himself, was a Latin  motet Vide homo quae pro te patior.  Herreweghe and his team give this work  the most exquisite performance imaginable.  I will list the soloists (note  that the SATB symbols here indicate a relative range of each part rather  than a voice type): 2S.2A.2T.B: Maria Cristina Kiehr, Johanna Koslowsky,  Simon Berridge, Gerd Turk, Herve Lamy, Peter Kooy, Adrian Peacock.
