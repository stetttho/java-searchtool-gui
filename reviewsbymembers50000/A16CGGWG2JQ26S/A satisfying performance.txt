 This CD is devoted to the feast of the Ascension.  Of the three works on this CD, one is an oratorio (BWV 11) and two are cantatas, but the oratorio is so short that it could have been called a cantata, and one of the  cantatas (BWV 43) is so long that it could have been called an oratorio.   Ultimately, however, terminology doesn't matter.  Bach's sacred music is  not an art for its own sake: the main determinant here is the spiritual  function of the music.  If Bach's approach to music wasn't functional, it  would have been unthinkable for him to reuse previously written material in  new works, but, as we know, Bach did so frequently.  On this CD, an example  of such self-borrowing is an alto aria "Ach bleibe doch" from the  Ascension Oratorio (Catherine Patriasz sings it quite well).  Bach reused  this aria as an instrumental accompaniment to "Agnus Dei" in  B-Minor Mass.  The Ascension Oratorio is structured as a  "historia," i.e., a narrative of an event.  Christoph Pregardien  is a marvelous evangelist.  You should also hear him doing the evangelist  on the recording of St. Matthew's Passion/Max.  BWV 43 also has an  interesting structure.  It is based on a lengthy six-stanza poem from the  scripture.  Bach adds variety to the lengthy piece by alternating short  arias and recitatives, binding them together by the symmetrical use of solo  voices throughout the cantata.  The third cantata, BWV 44, is remarkable  for its opening section, which combines an AT canon with a homophonic  choral line.  The soloists here are very good.  Christoph Pregardien and  Peter Kooy are as good as they get, but the female singers, especially,  Barbara Schlick, are also very competent.
