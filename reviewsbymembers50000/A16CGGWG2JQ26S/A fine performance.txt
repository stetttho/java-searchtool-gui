 Even though Christmas Oratorio is about 70% recycled, I really like it. In the process of creating this work, Bach freely borrowed from three previously written cantatas (BWV 213-215), but his genius succeeded in  transforming these discrete secular works into an interlinked whole, quite  suitable for religious content. Despite the adaptation, the music fits so  well that those who didn't know of its genesis would have never guessed.  For example, under Bach's magic wand, the same music that had served the  allegorical figure Sensuality in BWV 213 became the newborn Christ's  lullaby "Schlafe, mein Liebster!" Even though Bach reused many of  the arias, he newly composed most of the chorales and recitatives, as well  as the Pastoral Symphony which opens Part II. Christmas Oratorio has little  in common with other oratorios of the time: it is actually a series of  self-contained cantatas, linked together mainly by the Evangelist. The  narrative feature makes Christmas Oratorio similar to a  "historia" or a "passion." The role of the narrator is  very important (although small). I'm not sure Gura is entirely at home in  this role, but Jacobs likes him, and I don't much mind. If I could put  together my own Christmas Oratorio, I would pick the tenor from the  Christophers (Padmore), the alto from here (well, Scholl, obviously), the  bass from the Herreweghe (Kooy), and the soprano... hmm... turns out I  don't really have a soprano preference. Dorothea Roschmann will do. All in  all, this is a very strong release.
