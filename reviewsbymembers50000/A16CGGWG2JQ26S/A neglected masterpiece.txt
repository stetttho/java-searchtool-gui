 Unlike his more famous relative Giovanni Battista Draghi (a Purcell contemporary who worked in London), Antonio Draghi has been all but forgotten.  However, if this work is any indication, his output definitely contained some gems.  This is the first ever recording of La Vita nella Morte (Life in Death), but it definitely deserves to be heard.  La Vita nella Morte belongs to the genre of Italian sepolcro, a forerunner of oratorio.  As the name suggests, the main theme is the passion of Christ.  The evangelist of sorts is Humanita, an allegorical figure describing its path from the fall to redemption.  The lineup of characters includes Adam and Eve, but other than that all characters are allegories: Speranza (hope), Morte (death), Angelo (angel, obviously), Peccato (sin) etc.  Don't expect to be bored: despite the static libretto, a lot of the music is very lively and dynamic.  One ensemble ("Nome dolce, nome pio") is particularly stunning: it features two solo sections sung by the alto (Humanity), followed by two soprano-alto duets (Hope & Humanity), with a madrigalian SAB trio right in the middle (Death, Toil and Sin).  In this ensemble, when the voices of Hope and Humanity return after being interrupted by the ramblings of Death, Toil and Sin, the effect is both beautiful and uplifting.  The performances are extraordinary.  Special praises go to the high tenor Rodrigo del Pozo in the role of Humanita (note, this is an alto role, but you won't believe how well he sings it! - check out his solo CD "Sacred Songs of Sorrow").  --gggimpy@yahoo.com.
