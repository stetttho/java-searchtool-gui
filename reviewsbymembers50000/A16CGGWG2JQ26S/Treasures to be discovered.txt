 As much as I love Robin Blaze, I was a little reluctant to buy this CD,  thinking: yet another disc of lute songs? - I already have a dozen.  But as  soon as I saw the track listing, I had no further doubts.  The selection is  wonderful.  By combining the well known songs such as Dowland's In Darkness  Let Me Dwell with the rarely performed songs by Robert Jones, Matthew Locke  and John Banister, this disc is sure to satisfy both the connoisseur and  the novice.  Most of the songs are short - with one short melody following  another, 70 minutes seems to fly by in a blink of an eye.  Blaze's singing  is splendid.  His voice, with that inimitable woodwind quality and  sweetness, is so good that it would sound good even singing drones, but  there is more to it than just the beauty of tone.  Blaze shows himself  capable of a remarkable range of expression: from flamboyant (e.g., The  Delights of the Bottle), to dramatic (e.g., 'Tis Nature's Voice or Why so  pale), to lyrical (e.g., In Darkness Let Me Dwell or Can Doleful Notes), to  stately (Be Welcome Then, Great Sir).  In this regard, the selection here  is more balanced that the selection on Daniel Taylor's Tears of the Muse,  and the variety works to Blaze's advantage because, comparing the  melancholy pieces alone, Taylor comes out a winner (in my opinion, of  course).  The most magical piece on this disc is Henry Purcell's By  Beauteous Softness.  "Magical" is the word.  There is something  about Blaze's singing of Purcell that captures the very essence of  Purcell's style.  In fact, the best three minutes of countertenor singing  I've ever heard in my life was Blaze singing Purcell's Crown the Altar (no,  it's not included here - I wish).  In sum, this disc is a treasure.  --  gggimpy@yahoo.com
