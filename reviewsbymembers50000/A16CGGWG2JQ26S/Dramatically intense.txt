 This is a live recording from the 1999 Aix-de-Provence Festival.  As could  be expected, the live recorded sound is less than perfect: the voices often  sound distant or slightly muffled, and there are some stage noises.  On the  other hand, you can hear the singers clearly enough, and most audience  noises have been filtered out, so on balance the recording is quite  listenable.  Still, because this is a live recording, I can't give it five  stars.  Sound issues aside, I found the performance to be rather strong.  I  liked the fast tempi adopted by the young conductor Daniel Harding.  I was  pleasantly surprised to hear the fast, dramatically charged recitatives,  because from my (admittedly limited) perspective recitatives are usually  the dull part of Mozart operas.  The arias were sprightly but not unduly  fast.  By the way, BBC Music criticized the recording precisely for the  "relentlessly fast" tempi.  There is no accounting for tastes.   Of the soloists, I found the Don Giovanni of Peter Mattei to be absolutely  outstanding.  I also enjoyed the Don Ottavio of Mark Padmore, particularly  his stellar Dalla Sua Pace.  I was less impressed with Veronique Gens as  Donna Elvira - I used to like her more a few years ago when she didn't use  as much vibrato.  Still, her characterization of the role was wonderful.   The rest of the cast was generally up to the task.  This would not be my  desert island disc (nothing by Mozart would be, for that matter), but I  wouldn't want to be without it.
