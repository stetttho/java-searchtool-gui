 This is the first solo recital from the young Chilean tenor Rodrigo del Pozo.  It really deserves your attention.  The program is very well chosen.  These are songs by some of the "lesser" German composers - hence they are  not frequently recorded.  The relative obscurity of these songs is reason  number one to buy this CD.  Reason number two: the singer.  Rodrigo del  Pozo started his early music career as a lutenist.  It so happened,  however, that in 1990 he won a scholarship to study voice with the  celebrated British tenor Nigel Rogers, and so, luckily for all of us,  Rodrigo switched to singing.  Among tenors, Rodrigo's voice is one of the  most beautiful and easily the most unusual.  Not only is his voice  meltingly sweet and luminous, but it also boasts an unusually wide range,  spanning two adjacent registers - alto and tenor - with no register break.   The pieces on this disc (some of which are in the low alto range) show  Rodrigo's amazing vocal versatility.  All of the pieces here are sung with  elegant graces and, even more importantly, with keen attention to the  meaning of the text.  The most effective piece - by any measure - is Johann  Christoph Bach's Ach da ich Wassers g'nug htte, exploring the full  amplitude of human sorrow and hope, from the brooding beginning ("Oh, if  only I had enough tears to lament my failings), to the emphatically  pounding syllables on "denn der Herr hat mich voll Jammers gemacht," to the  slowly dying note on "Am Tage seines grimmigen Zorns," to the lyrically  floating repetition of the first stanza.  The result is haunting.  I can  practically guarantee you that this piece will be etched in your memory for  ever. --gggimpy@yahoo.com
