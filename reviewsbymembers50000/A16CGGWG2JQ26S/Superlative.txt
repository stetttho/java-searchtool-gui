 This marvelous CD canvasses two great examples of Ockeghem's genius: Missa Fors Seulement (recorded here for the first time! ), a texturally cohesive, deeply reflective work, probably dating from the last decade of  the composer's life, and Requiem, probably an earlier work, a texturally  diverse compilation of movements that seem to accumulate in complexity with  each passing movement - some say it's a pastiche from several Ockeghem's  requiems, but perhaps it was intended as an exploration of styles witnessed  and tried by Ockeghem during his life, from the most geometrical to the  most florid and melodic.  These amazing musical contrasts, all within 71  minutes of playing time, help one appreciate the reason Ockeghem was so  respected by his contemporaries.  The booklet mentions the poetic and  musical tributes to Ockeghem that were written on his death.  The most well  known of them is Josquin's Deploration on the death of Ockeghem (nymphes du  bois) which can be heard on The Hilliard's recording of Josquin's Motets  and Chansons - listen to it, it weaves two lines of Requiem into the  heart-rending secular lament by poet Molinet.  The "fillers" on  this disc are also remarkable.  One is a setting of Ockeghem's famous  rondeau Fors Seulement by Pierre de la Rue (Ockeghem's original Fors  Seulement is also featured).  The other is the darkly intriguing Du Tout  Plongiet by Antoine Brumel.  The Clerks vocalize all four parts, but, as  was observed by Gramophone, they owe their inspiration to the pioneering  recording of this work by David Munrow, on the Art of the Netherlands CD,  with Martyn Hill and Geoffrey Shaw, accompanied by two bass viols.  This  single piece, with two lines of thought moving simultaneously in perfect  counterpoint, is so beautiful that it alone is worth the price of this  disc.  Unsurprisingly, this disc won a Gramophone award.
