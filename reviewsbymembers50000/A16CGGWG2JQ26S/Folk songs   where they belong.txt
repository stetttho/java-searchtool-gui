 In the universe of singers specializing in song, Daniel Taylor takes a special place.  He really knows how to communicate emotion.  Even the simplest of songs come out memorable when Dan sings them.  Unlike many recordings of lute songs, this disc includes a fair amount of anonymous material, and the approach taken by the singer is very appropriate.  I think the point of this disc was to bring these songs home to their origins.  I think it worked.  The singing here is gentle, intimate, purposely unaffected: it evokes the image of a wandering 16th century bard singing his own songs to a bunch of villagers, plucking his own lute.  The simplicity is utterly beguiling because it communicates so much and because it makes falsetto sound like the most natural of voices.  The centerpiece of this disc is Robert Jones's melancholy Lie Down Poor Heart.  Clocking at more than 7 minutes, it never gets boring.  The lightly decorated stanza with which it ends is absolutely delicious.  Dowland's evergreen Sorrow Stay and I Saw My Lady Weep, interpreted through a folk lens, are striking in their freshness.  Of the folk songs, O Waly Waly and especially Black Is The Colour really stick in memory.  If there is anything about this disc that was not quite to my liking it was the playing of Sylvain Bergeron.  I do not profess to know much about lutes, but, to me, the lute often sounded like it was being played one string at a time.  For example, Bergeron's accompaniment to I Will Give My Love an Apple sounded like "boink - boink - boink..."   You won't be surprised that I thought that there were way too many solo lute pieces on this disc (11 of 24).  But I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this disc to anyone (just skip the lute).  -- gggimpy@yahoo.com.
