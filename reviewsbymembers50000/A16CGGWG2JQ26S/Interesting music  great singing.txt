 The music on this CD represents the style of composition prevalent in the mid-14th century, the so called ars nova.  This style was notable for "hocketing" (i.e. oscillation between short notes and short rests  in the upper voices), and even syncopation, but it also included a  technique quite different from the ones just mentioned - the so called  isorhythm (i.e. regularly repeating rhythmic and harmonic structures).   Machaut was a great master of both of these facets of ars nova, but he was  by no means the only one, as was demonstrated by a recent Clerks' recording  of music from the Ivrea Codex (and if you ask me, the greatest master of  isorhythm was John Dunstable).  As the in-house reviewer mentions, the  music on this disc is more idiosyncratic, less regular, more syncopated  than the typical 14-th century musical output.  Breaking the rules while  perfecting the style has always been a sign of genius, in any age.  The  Orlando Consort give this music the recording it deserves (I must commend  this group for carving out a niche for themselves despite the fact that the  idea of having an all-male quartet sing early music so smacks of the  Hilliard that it would seem to be a difficult act to follow).  The voices  blend exquisitely, combining the beauty of tone with an expert technique -  even Robert Jones, whose voice I normally find rather harsh, sounds  relatively mellow and seductive in this recording.  Charles Daniels is  great, as always: his solo piece, Liement me deport, is utterly delightful.   gkolomietz@yahoo.com
