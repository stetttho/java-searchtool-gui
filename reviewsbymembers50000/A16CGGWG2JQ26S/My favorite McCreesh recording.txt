 Even by Paul McCreesh' high standards, this recording is a marvel.  The  generous acoustics, the bass-heavy chorus, and the dark accompaniment of a  Spanish dulcian (called Bajon) create the hair-rising sonority that is so  symbolic of the profundity of death.  The choral sound is very open, in a  characteristically Spanish way; it comes close to being a "wall of  sound," but the textual detail remains traceable.  In fact, the more  austere the general mood of the work, the more effective are the sections  in which the intensity of individual lines is more evident (e.g.,  Offertorium and the Osannas).  The structure of the mass, with the highest  and the lowest voices being generally more static than the voices in the  middle, seems designed to highlight the value of fleeting human existence  in the middle of perpetual dichotomies.   As is usual with McCreesh, the  mass is placed in its proper liturgical context (and the quasi-improvized  choral chants are not even boring!).  The disc ends with Alonso Lobo's  magnificent motet Versa est in luctum, notable for its high-flying top  line.
