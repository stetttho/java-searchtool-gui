 The critics are right: this recording is remarkable.  This CD has won a Gramophone award, 4f Telerama, 10 Repertoire, and a Diapason d'Or.  It has also made the list of the 50 Best Baroque Recordings (BBC Music).  Listen:  I'm not even a particular fan of Andreas Scholl, but this is one of my most  favorite recordings (in a collection that numbers almost 1,000 CD's).   Scholl is uniquely suited to the repertory such as this.  His angelic voice  may not always rise to the occasion in opera (although his performance in  Solomon certainly challenges this assumption), but that same angelic voice  is always at home in sacred music - blending calm reverence with a hint of  emotion, in a manner that is both beautiful and heart-breaking.  Listen to  his Stabat Mater to know what I mean.  Scholl's voice is also quite at home  in the secular cantata Cessate Omai Cessate, a cry of unrequited love,  albeit more elegaic than passionate.  At the surface, this recording,  featuring some of the world's most beautiful melodies, is an easy listening  (is there a melody more ravishing than Larghetto from Cessate?). But the  listening is also revelatory and rewarding because it leads to new layers  of meaning and expression on each new listen.  gkolomietz@yahoo.com
