 I bought this CD after hearing this group's fabulous reconstruction of Cordoba Vespers.  Again, I am very impressed.  This again is a reconstruction - this time of the Requiem Mass as it might have been performed in Seville Cathedral to honor Guerrero's death in 1599.  Guerrero, whose own 1582 Requiem mass forms the backbone of the instant recording, was a native of Seville, but his music was well known as far as Mexico, Guatemala and Chile.  In fact, during his life, Guerrero may have been the most celebrated Spanish composer.  The reconstruction of the funeral service here is very convincing.  It begins with an instrumental processional, performed on sackbutts, shawms and cornetts, wonderfully accentuated by drums.  The main body of the mass unfolds in a well-integrated sequence of solo and choral plainchant (drawn from contemporary Spanish sources) and polyphonic movements elaborating on the plainchant, accompanied by either a solo dulcian, or a consort of wind instruments which frequently double solo voices in a very characteristic manner of the age.  The mass ends with a plainchant antiphon In paradisum fading beautifully into the distance as the imaginary funeral procession leaves the church.  The singing is superb.  Special mention goes to Josep Cabre and Simon Davies as plainchant soloists, who do such a wonderful job of binding professionally-written polyphonic movements with their anonymous liturgical roots.
