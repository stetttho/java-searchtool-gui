 I rarely disagree with Matthew Westphal, but this is one of those rare occasions where I must say that he's wrong.  This recording is NOT likely to disappoint, whether or not you are a dedicated fan of Bonney and/or  Scholl (I'm not).  Perhaps this recording was not urgently needed - there  are countless other versions of Pergolesi Stabat Mater in the catalogue.   So it may well have been that Decca arranged for this recording mainly to  cash in on its two brightest young stars (if you ask me, Scholl's Heroes  recital was probably the result of the same kind of marketing ploy).  But  the result is, nevertheless, wonderful.  The first aspect of this recording  that immediately stands out is the exquisite blend of the two voices.  Both  voices are similar in tone and warmth; and both seem to be best suited to  slow, contemplative music.  Some of the faster passages may have benefited  from more imagination (I dind't like track 4), but the slower passages are  outright hypnotic.  I particularly enjoyed tracks 9 and 12.  Maybe, in the  view of some people "hypnotic" will immediately translate into  "undercharacterized," but I meant this epithet as a praise.   There are moments in this performance that will simply stop you in your  tracks.  Scholl's voice is especially effective in the lower register - it  amazes me how low he can go without switching out of falsetto.  The  singers' interpretation of the material is not inventive, but it is  graceful and refined, in a way that will probably appeal to the majority of  listeners.  Hey, simplicity is not always bland!  gkolomietz@yahoo.com
