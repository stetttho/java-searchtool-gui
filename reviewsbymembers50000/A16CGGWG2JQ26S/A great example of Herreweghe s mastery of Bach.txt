 This 5-CD set collects some of the best recordings of Bach cantatas available on disc.  The title "The most beautiful cantatas" is undoubtedly subjective (other people might come up with a different list of  the most beautiful cantatas), but the name behind this subjectivity is  Herreweghe himself.  He has been quoted as saying that he records only the  works he likes the most.  So, these are Herreweghe's favorite cantatas, and  he does a wonderful job of making sure that they become our favorite  cantatas as well.  These are not new releases - the same cantatas are  available on separate CD's.  But buying them together makes sense.   Besides, it is a safe bet.  Chances that you'd get disapponted are next to  nil.  Herreweghe's conducting is sensitive and nuanced.  The voices in the  chorus are well-matched and accompanied by a skilled period orchestra.  The  soloists on each CD are trusted specialists.  In fact, I'll list them,  since Amazon doesn't currently provide these details.  CD1 Cantates pour  alto - well, no mention needed, Andreas Scholl, of course.  CD2 Cantates  pour basse - Peter Kooy (the same guy whose name is variously misspelled as  Kooj or something even stranger).  CD3 Cantates BWV 21 & 42 - SATBB  Barbara Schick, Gerard Lesne, Howard Crook, Peter Harvey, Peter Kooy.  CD4  Cantates 8, 125, 138 - SATB Deborah York, Ingeborg Danz, Mark Padmore,  Peter Kooy.  CD5 Cantates 198 & 78 - SATB Ingrid Schmithusen, Charles  Brett, Howard Crook, Peter Kooy.  Happy listening!  gkolomietz@yahoo.com
