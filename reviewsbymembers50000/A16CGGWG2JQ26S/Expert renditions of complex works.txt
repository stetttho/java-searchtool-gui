 The Franco-Flemish composer Nicolas Gombert is still not very well known.  But this is changing.  There are quite a few great recordings of his works, and this is one of them.  This recording collects some of Gombert's relatively small-scale compositions, including his best known work - Lugebat David Absalon. This piece was formerly attributed to Josquin, but Gombert's authorship is now widely accepted.  Incidentally, this piece is also known as Je prens congie, and can be heard in that version on, e.g., Cordoba Vespers/Cheetham or Music from the Court of Charles V/Huelgas Ens.  Lugebat David Absalon is an anguished lament of an uncommon complexity: opening with a solo voice, it quickly builds momentum until all eight voices participate, repeating and imitating the main theme.  It showcases many of the distinguishing characteristics of Gombert's style: intricate imitation, long themes, absence of rests, and an abundance of low voices.  The most peculiar and exciting characteristic of Gombert's writing, to me, is his precocious treatment of tonality.  An example of this can be heard most clearly at the beginning of O Beata Maria, or by comparing the treatment of the same melodic motive at the beginning of Lugebat David Absalon and the Eight-Part Credo.  By altering imitative responses to the introductory motives, Gombert achieves an unusual alternation between minor-sounding and major-sounding tonalities.  Henry's Eight give a very clean and persuasive account of these works.  --gggimpy@yahoo.com
