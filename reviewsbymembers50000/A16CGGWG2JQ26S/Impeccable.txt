 Most listeners probably associate Vespers with the name Claudio Monteverdi.  But in fact, in Renaissance Italy, liturgical sequences known as Vespers (performed in celebration of the virgin Mary) were second in  importance only to Mass; hence, every composer wrote them.  The  compositions chosen for this recording came from Musiche Sacre, a large  body of liturgical music for virtually every church occasion, published by  Cavalli in 1656.  While not attempting to reconstruct a full Vespers  service, Bruce Dickey and Charles Toet nevertheless arranged the individual  musical items in their proper liturgical context, complete with plainchant  antiphonas and instrumental canzonas.  Following Andrew Parrott's  groundbreaking one-voice-per-part (OVPP) recording of Monteverdi's Vespers,  Dickey and Toet adopted the same approach: they hired only eight singers  (exactlly enough to fill two SATB choirs), and used cornets to double the  voices in ripieno settings.  Like Parrott, Dickey and Toet also opted for  high tenors, rather than falsettists, in alto lines (although Rodrigo del  Pozo integrates falsetto with his natural voice so well that you may think  he is a countertenor).  The main feature I like about OVPP performances in  general is that they force directors to hire the best possible singers.   Since every voice is exposed, the quality of each voice is crucial.  This  recording is no exception.  The cast assembled here is superb by any  measure, and their musical instincts are impeccable.  The instrumentalists  are no less distinguished.  With all due respect for Paul McCreesh, the  Lauda Jerusalem on this recording is better than on McCreesh' award-winning  recording of Venetian Vespers.  Two psalms for three voices, Laetatus Sum  and Ave Maris Stella, are even more stunning  (incidentally, the notes to  Laetatus Sum confuse Markus Brutscher with Mark Padmore - but if that is  NOT Mark Padmore I promise to eat my hat).  gkolomietz@yahoo.com
