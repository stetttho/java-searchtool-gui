 At the moment, this is my favorite Bach recording.  I am a big fan of the one-voice-per-part approach ("OVPP"), and I truly feel that, where its use is appropriate, a small consort of voices offers better results than a traditional chorus (current evidence suggests that OVPP was likely used at least in Bach's early cantatas and in Passions).  If you listen to this recording with an open mind, you might be able to recognize the merits of this approach: clarity of lines, better balance between the vocalists and the instrumentalists, and a potential for a finer insight into the meaning of the text.  Some tempo issues aside, this recording is nearly as good as they come (besides, tempi are, to some extent, a matter of personal preference).  Andrew Parrott's direction is generally well judged, and the cast he assembled is superb.  I particularly enjoyed the contributions of Charles Daniels (one of my favorite tenors) and Caroline Trevor.  I have to admit to a bit of a bias in favor of male altos, but Caroline Trevor is so superb that few countertenors can compare.  Her Saget, saget, mir geschwinde, for instance, is definitely the best I've heard.   --gggimpy@yahoo.com
