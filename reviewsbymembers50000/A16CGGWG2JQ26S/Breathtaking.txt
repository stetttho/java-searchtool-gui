 I didn't think I'd ever be reviewing an instrumental recording.  I lack an intuitive understanding of instrumental music, so, resources being limited, I usually limit my collection to vocal genres.  But this recording was so wildly praised by critics (Gramophone award; BBC Music 50 best baroque  recordings of all time, etc.), that I decided to give it a shot.  I'm glad  I did.  The music is absolutely fascinating, and brilliantly performed.   The inventive melodies, full of varied nuances, leave a constant impression  of improvization - it is almost hard to believe that in fact every note is  captured on the printed page.  With the composer's virtuosity so vividly  imprinted in the music, Andrew Manze is careful not to over-characterize  these sonatas.  Every response is calculated to match the mood of the  material: from the mellifluous preludes, such as in Sonatas 2 & 3, to  the deft recitatives, such as in Sonata 5, down to the whimsical animal  effects in Sonata Representativa.  Although Manze's violing playing  definitely takes center stage, the other two musicians also need to be  lauded for their wonderful contributions.  I particularly enjoyed the  Passacaglia for solo lute played by Nigel North.  Interestingly, this lute  piece improvizes on the melody that is also heard in Sonata 6 - and in both  cases the melody is tantalizingly familiar.  It is no secret that Biber  didn't shy away from borrowing other people's music.  If you figure out  where this one comes from, please let me know.
