 This is a very important recording because Du Mont is not well represented on disc.  The performances on this recording are very good, yet I hesitate to give them five stars because I've heard better.  Specifically, I'm  referring to the wonderful disc of Du Mont's vocal and instrumental pieces  recorded by Christophe Rousset (Virgin Veritas 5 61531 2).  Unfortunately  (or maybe fortunately), Rousset's selection of pieces is very different  from the pieces collected on this disc (only Dialogus de Anima is present  on both recordings) - that's why, if you're interested in French baroque,  it's important to own both the Rousset and the Herreweghe.  The most  noticeable, although not necessarily the most important, difference between  the two approaches is their treatment of the haute-contre line.  People  continue to disagree about what haute-contre means, and there may be more  than one way to do it, but French baroque specialists such as William  Christie seem to have concluded that hautes-contre were high tenors rather  than falsettists.  Accordingly, Rousset gives the alto line to English  tenor Mark Padmore, while Herreweghe uses the late Henri Ledroit who was  more of a contralto than a high tenor.  Whether you find this significant  or not is up to you.  Based on the Dialogus, I also find Rousset's tempi to  be more appropriate, plus his recording benefits from a very generous  acoustics of a real church loft.  But, like I said, since only one piece  overlaps on both recordings, any more comparisons between them would be  unwarranted.  Both are very valuable.
