 Sebastien de Brossard is mostly known as a music theorist.  However, he was also a prolific composer (he composed about 60 motets, including "grands motets," i.e., motets for chorus and soloists, and "petits motets," i.e., motets for solo voices or combinations of solo voices).  Brossard's writing was influenced by his scholarly background: he makes great use of the word-painting attributes of various instruments, changes in tonality, and the expressive effects inherent in the alternations between soli and tutti passages.  His Grands Motets have a clean mathematical quality and a pan-European flavor, revealing his great fluency with musical features of three cultures - French, Italian and German.  The present recording underscores the pan-European flavor of these motets by performing them in "high," as opposed to local, Latin.  The soloists are excellent.  They are: Delphine Collot & Catherine Padaut, soprano; Jean-Paul Fouchecourt, haute-contre; Gilles Ragon, tenor; Olivier Lallouette, baritone; and Jerome Correas, bass.
