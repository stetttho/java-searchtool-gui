 I find it really puzzling when people write reviews only to complain about the inadequacy of packaging. I'm sure Gerard Lesne had nothing to do with the label's decision to reissue these recordings without texts - so he  shouldn't be getting three stars because of that (see one of the reviews  below).  These are wonderful recordings.  CD1 contains four cantatas and  two sonatas by the Venetian composer Antonio Caldara.  Until recently,  Caldara was barely represented on disc, but now there are two exceptional  recordings: this one and Maddalena ai Piedi di Cristo/Jacobs (don't miss!).   Although three of the cantatas on this disc are relatively conventional  pastorales, the fourth one, Medea in Corinto, is anything but striking.   Caldara demonstrates genuine dramatic skills, tracing Medea's famous  revenge from the moment she first realizes Jason's been unfaithful to the  moment she seals her decision to punish Jason by summoning the demons to  carry out the deed.  Lesne's superb intonation renders the character of  Medea almost jarringly real.  Who needs sleeve notes?  CD2 features five  motets by Alessandro Stradella, another relatively unknown Italian who  really deserves to be heard. (don't miss Stradella's oratorio San Giovanni  Battista/Minkowski, Erato 2292-45739-2, also with Lesne - buy it, you'll  thank me).  Each of the motets on this disc is structurally distinct, but  what unites them is Stradella's remarkable gift as a melodist.  Lesne is  joined here by soprano Sandrine Piau, his frequent singing partner.  They  make a memorable vocal combination. gkolomietz@yahoo.com
