 One of the first early music recordings to win a Gramophone prize (that was in 1983), this recording has lost none of its luster since.  The singers, occasionally accompanied by reed drones, but mostly singing a  capella, rise to the highest levels of tonal beauty and technical skill.   Star sopranos Emma Kirkby (appearing as a guest) and Emily van Evera (Mrs.  Parrott) head the cast which is also featuring Andrew Parrott as a tenor,  although now he is mostly known as a period performance conductor and a  scholar (his book on OVPP performance practices is coming out in February).   My pick of the entire Gothic Voices series, however, is the alto Margaret  Philpot whose mastery of the alto register is so remarkable for her gender.   She sings two solo pieces on this disc: Ave generosa and O presul vere  civitas.  Her presentation is flawless!  Gothic Voices sing the plainchant  melodies on this disc in a meditative, unadorned style, the way - as the  notes inform - the devout abbess may have wanted them sung.  I fully agree  with this stylistic choice.  gkolomietz@yahoo.com
