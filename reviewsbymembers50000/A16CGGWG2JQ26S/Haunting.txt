 This is my favorite Gothic Voices recording.  The program, entitled "Binchois and his contemporaries," is somewhat eclectic, combining secular and religious pieces of disparate qualities and purposes (including even a piece by Machaut, hardly a Binchois contemporary), but the singing is superb.  The singing here is unaccompanied, but the program also includes four songs played on a trio of lutes.  The highlight of the disc are two three-part songs by Binchois: Amoreux sui and Ay! doloureux.  As far as I'm concerned, these are some of the best love songs ever written.  In addition to being hauntingly melodic, these melancholy songs are also characterized by some very interesting chromatic alterations that create, in the words of Christopher Page, a "bitter-sweet" effect.  The poignancy of a lost love has rarely been so well captured.  Paul Agnew is spectacular as the cantus in Ay! doloureux.  Another piece on this disc that deserves a separate mention is Dunstable's three-part Beata Dei genitrix, with the top line expertly sung by Rogers Covey-Crump.
