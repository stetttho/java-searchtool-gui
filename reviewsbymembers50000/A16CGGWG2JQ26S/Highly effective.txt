 I have all of Herreweghe's recordings of Bach.  I am a fan of the balmy precision and spotless polish of Herreweghe's approach, but if you're  looking for edgier performances you may want to look elsewhere.   Herreweghe's recordings of Bach are organized thematically.  This CD,  featuring cantatas Bach wrote for the annual inauguration of the Leipzig  town council, is perhaps less momentous than Herreweghe's previous CD  exploring the Lutheran perspective on death ("Mit Fried und  Freud"), but it is delightful nevertheless.  The narrow municipal  purpose of these cantatas is transcended by the rich scoring of the  instrumental parts and the subtlety of the arias.  Other than Ingeborg Danz  (whom I don't consider to be the most appropriate Bach alto), the soloists  here would be my top choice for any Bach recording.  The marvelous Peter  Kooy doesn't get a lot to sing, but the few lines he does sing practically  steal the show.  Mark Padmore is nearly perfect in "Wohl dir, du Volk  der Linden" (although a bit less so in "Halleluja, Strk und  Macht").  Deborah York dazzles with "Gedenk an uns mit deiner  Liebe" - possibly the highest point of the entire Herreweghe Bach  series.  I'm looking forward to future Herreweghe Bach releases.  --  gggimpy@yahoo.com
