 As far as my personal opinion goes, Daniel Taylor is everything I want in a countertenor.  His singing combines a naturally sounding tone, a comfortably wide range, and an uncanny ability to convey emotion.  Critics  occasionally fault him for not being more dramatic (see, e.g., the  editorial review on this page), but to me, Taylor's subtle tools of  expression are much more appealing than the more overtly operatic style of  some other countertenors.  Besides, the absence of operatic drama is  irrelevant when it comes to a disc like this one.  This CD collects several  lyrical (or even melancholy) pieces by Henry Purcell.  Taylor's subtlety  works very well in this selection.  Two pieces are absolute gems: An  Evening Hymn (a remarkable combination of a treble-like sound and a mature  eloquence), and John Blow's Ode on the death of Purcell (Taylor runs  Michael Chance very close in this one!).
