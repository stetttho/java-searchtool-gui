 Paul McCreesh is a master of reconstruction: he takes discrete, sometimes well-familiar, pieces and places them in the context of church liturgy.  This endeavor requires formidable research, both into the performing  practices of the period from which the music came, and into the devotional  practices that coexisted with the music.  McCreesh' reconstructions of  Venetian services, masses by Praetorius and Morales, and now this Epiphany  mass have been praised by critics of all hues, including those who are  generally suspicious of the period performance scholarship.  This uniform  acceptance speaks volumes for the merits of McCreesh' approach to musical  reconstructions.  As a backbone for the Epiphany service on these two  discs, McCreesh uses the vocal music from Missa Brevis in F major and  cantatas "Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen" and "Schmucke  dich, o liebe Seele," as well as the organ music from Toccata in B  flat minor and preludes from several cantatas.  These pieces are  interpolated with congregational singing of hymns, recitations of prayers,  and even a sermon chanted in German at the end of the first disc!  If you  don't want to feel like you're attending a church service every time you  pick up this set, you can skip the devotional interpolations.  You will  still get more than enough for your money.  Both discs are filled to the  brink: CD1 is 80 min., CD2 is 79:59 min.!  This release features a  celebrated organist James O'Donnell and a number of world-class singers  such as Charles Daniels, Ann Monoyos and Peter Harvey.  As the editorial  review mentions, the choral forces are very lean and elegant.  The music  really breathes under their light touch.  Especially thrilling are the two  sections sung one-voice-per-part: Sanctus in D major from BWV 238 and the  opening chorus from BWV 180. gkolomietz@yahoo.com
