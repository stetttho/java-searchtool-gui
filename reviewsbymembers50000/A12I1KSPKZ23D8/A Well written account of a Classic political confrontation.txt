 ...I agree that the cost is a bit much but I believe that the reader will conclude as I have that it's well worth it.I would also concede that if you are not into British politics all of the talk about coalitions and cabinet reshuffles can be a little hard to follow. But Graham Stewart carries it off very well.This book is at bottom the story of an ancient political rivalry between two statesman that changed ultimately the course of history.Stewart traces it the way back to the fathers of the two men Randolph Churchill and Joseph Chamberlain who were at various times political allies and adversaries.What they both had in common was that neither made it to the top as Prime minister. Both died in the hope that their supreme ambitions would be realized in their sons. But the big question which Stewart effectively answers in this book is why was''nt Churchill instead of Chamberlain PM in the thirties? Churchill was smarter,He had a much wider experience in government.Had he been Prime Minister Could He not have promoted rearmament and other steps that might have headed off World WarII? Stewart shows us clearly why this did not happen. Why Churchill was seen in the thirties as a political has-ben and an adventurer who was totally out of touch with the times. While Chamberlain was seen in Lady Astor's memorable phrase as ''the coming man''.All of it makes Churchill's final dramatic acension to power at the crucial moment in the history of the world all the more dramatic and providential.Graham Stewart has written a superb book.
