 Forrest MacDonald never fails to give us a stimulating read and this book is no exception. In this book Professor Macdonald analyizes the concepts of union and states rights as they were understood by Americans from the formation of the constitution to the civil war and reconstruction periods.MacDonald takes us on a fascinating journey through the political thought of everyone from Jefferson, Hamilton and Madison to Lincoln and Thaddeus Stevens, It is a trip well worth taking. The author shows us why Lincoln's compact theory of the union,that the states were the creation of the union, simply will not survive an examination of our constitutional history. MacDonald points out that Jefferson and Madison responded to an egregious exspansion of federal power in the form of the odious alien and sedition acts by drafting the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions  which asserted that states had the right to refuse to obey federal legislation they considered to be unconstitutional. Taken from this perspective secession does not seem all that radical a response. I don''t agree with everything that MacDonald says in this book but I think everyone will find  reading it a challenging intellectual feast.
