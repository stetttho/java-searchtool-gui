 Ulysses  S. Grant is one of the most written about figures in all of history and one of the most surpassingly interesting. I have been reading about Grant for almost forty years now and I still don''t think that I know  enough about Him.Brooks Simpson has written a magnificent biography which  takes it's place among the classics of Civil War literature. Simpson is not  a Haigieographer. He clearly takes an objective view of Grant, which is  long overdue.The Author explores Grant's complex relationships with His  parents and His cantankerous Father-in-law, Colonel Dent and also the most  important relationship of Grant's life with His beloved wife Julia and  their children. Simpson shows us how Grant's failures in civilian life  prepared Him for success in war.Simpson clearly shows us that Grant was one  of the greatest military commanders of all time. He did''nt not prevail  because of superior numbers and resources, you will note that Lee did not  surrender to McClellan , Burnside or Hooker who also had superior numbers  and resources. No Grant prevailed because of superior Generalship. Simpson  shows us how the persistent allegations about Grant's drinking are overdone  at best. Certainly Grant did have a drinking problem but He was able to  control it. And there is no record of His drinking ever interfereing with  military operations.Simpson does not overlook Grant's shortcomings, some of  which were horrendous. I cannot reccomend this book highly enough. Even if  you are not a Civil War buff I believe you will find this a great read.
