 Robert Slayton has written a great political biography about a truly great,but sadly forgotten, Statesman,Al Smith. Professor Slayton is a master storyteller who writes with verve and humor. The best parts of the book are about Smith's Governorship and His wonderful family life.Smith was probably New York's greatest Governor and Slayton clearly shows us why.The book has two minor flaws; The account of Smith's failed 1928 campaign for the presidency is excellent except for Slayton's attempt to prove that Smith was defeated solely because of his religion.His attempt falls short.Clearly Smith's catholicism was an issue and it did hurt him. But Slayton fails to make the case that given the great prosperity of the twenties, for which the Republicans were generally credited, that any Democrat could have been elected that year.The book's other shortcoming is it's attempt to explain Smith's drift to the right in His final years. After clearly establishing the considerable ideological differences between Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt Slayton attempts to explain Smith's rightward tilt in psychological ,or should I say psychobabble terms. It is really very simple,some people become more conservative as they get older.But taken as a whole this is a great book, a fascinating biography of a statesman of vision and integrity that all of us should know more about than we do.
