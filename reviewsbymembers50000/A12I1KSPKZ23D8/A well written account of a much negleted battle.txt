 Cold Harbor is one of the least written about but yet  one of the most significant battles of the Civil war. It was the last Confederate victory in the eastern theatre.It was less a Confederate victory than a Union defeat or perhaps disaster is a better word. The disasters on Marye's Heights at Fredericksburg and Pickett's charge at Gettysburg should have convinced Generals on both sides of the fallacy of sending massed formations up against an entrenched line. But that is exactly what U.S. Grant did at Cold Harbor, not once but twice.The author says that Cold Harbor is the greatest blot on Grant's reputation and that had any other Union General committed a similar blunder He would have been sacked in short order.Yet other distinguished civil war Historians such as T. Harry Williams and Russell Weighley dismiss Cold Harbor as just another part of Grant's campaign of attrition against the Army of Northern Virginia which ended ultimately in victory for the Army of the Potomac.Yet it is instructive that Grant called Cold Harbor one of only two mistakes He made in the war. Ernest Furgurson is clearly anti-Grant but He is an excellent writer. He shows us clearly that the Cold Harbor disaster was rooted in the strained relationship between Grant and the commander of the Army of the Potomac George G. Meade. This is an outstanding book that well deserves a place of honor of the library of every serious Civil War student.
