 The Presidential campaign of 1948 is one of the most memorable in American history.Zachary Karabell is a competent writer who gives a lively and compelling account of this memorable election.He strips away much of the  mythology surrounding this election.He clearly shows us why Truman won and  why it should not be so surprising that He did.Truman waged a campaign that  can only be characterized as in the gutter.Dewey like Michael Dukakis forty  years later suffered because of His failure to respond to Truman's  attacks.Mr. Karabell's work falls short on a number of areas mainly in His  portrayal of Henry Wallace as sort of a lovable eccentric.In reality  Wallace was a leading apologist for Stalin and His party was  little more  than a Communist front. The author's comparison of Strom Thurmond to George  Wallace is on the mark but He makes a major factual error in saying that  Wallace''cut His teeth''on the Dixiecrat campaign in reality the future  Alabama Governor supported Truman. Karabell's central point that 1948 was  the last pre-tv campaign and that we had much more representative politics  then is probably accurate and that though Dewey lost He was the prototype  of candidates of the television age is also right on.I agree with a  previous reviewer that Karabell missed a great opportunity by not giving  more attention to election night and the reactions of the candidates.While  this book has many deficiencies it is still a good read especially for all  of us political Junkies.
