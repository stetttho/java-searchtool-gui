 This book has a very interesting premise, how fourteen men helped to shape  the Post Civil War era.But ultimately the author fails to establish just  how men like George McClellan, John Bell Hood and JohnS. Mosby helped to  shape the postwar era.As for those of His subjects who genuinely did help  to shape the era Dr. Jones has nothing new to say and what He does say is  pedestrian and superficial.The role of Robert E. Lee is overrated and that  of U.S. Grant is underrrated.At the conclusion of His chapter on Andrew  Johnson Dr. Jones concludes''Johnson may have been a racist.'' This is  rather like saying that Calvin Coolidge may have been a Republican.The book  is supposed to be about those who shaped the postwar era but their are no  chapters on Frederick Douglass, Thaddeus Stevens or Charles Sumner.The book  just does''nt live up to the premise of it's title. If Paul Harvey had  written this book it would be titled something like''The Civil War;The Rest  of the Story''Also if Paul Harvey were the author it would have been much  better written.If you are a Civil War Buff you will find this book pasably  interesting but certainly not to be ranked along side the works of Shelby  Foote, Bruce Catton and James McPherson.If you are not a Civil War Buff  this book is a waste of time and money.
