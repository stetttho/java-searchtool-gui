 Robert Conquest is one of the true Heroes of the twentieth century. In books like ''Harvest of Sorrow'' and the''Great terror'' He exposed the murderous evil of stalinism which for sheer numbers causes Hitler's holocaust to pale by comparison. Yet for all His trouble Conquest was denounced by the international media establishment and the Apostles of political correctness for ''overreaching''. His allegations against the ''Workers Paradise'' could not possibly be true. Well now the Evil Empire has fallen and the archives are open and the accuracy of Conquest's work is proven beyond all doubt.No man on earth has a better right to say ''I told you so''! This book is a series of essays about the twentieth century and the ideas that turned it into a slaughterhouse; Communism, Fascism and Utopianism. All of these ideologies are rooted in the idea that the state knows better than the Individual about how to solve society's problems.And that the state should have whatever power  necessary to solve those problems. Conquest shows us what the twentieth century should have shown us that this type of thinking is the slippery slope to Auschwitz and the Gulag.Sadly Conquest shows us that mankind appears not to have learned it's lesson. This is an excellent book which provides more than sufficient armor for the continuing culture wars of the 21st century. I highly reccomend it
