 This is one of those books that every person should  read. The book chronicles the crimes of all the Communist regimes from the Bolshevik  revolution to Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge.This book provides a welcome  antidote to all the leftist nonsense about Communism is a good idea gone  bad.It clearly shows that every Communist Leader from Lenin to Pol Pot was  committed to killing off a substantial number of it's own people that it  found undesirable. The very same things that Hitler and the Nazis did.In  reading the customer reviews I find it incredible that their are still  people who defend this evil system.But then maybe we should''nt be  surprised. If one believes in socialism or communism one must either  embrace Lenin, Stalin,Mao, Castro and it's other bloodthirsty Heroes or  admit the bankruptacy of their own ideology. I highly reccomend this book.  It is a sobering experience but also an enlightening one.
