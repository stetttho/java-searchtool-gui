 Theodore  Roosevelt once said something to the effect that a great Historian must also be a great writer.David McCulloch has always taken T.R.'s advice literally with such excellent books as ''Mornings on Horseback'', ''The Path between the Seas'' and His classic ''Truman''.Now He has given us a portrait of one of our greatest, but sadly forgotten Founding Fathers John Adams. The Life of John Adams is a testament to courage, honor, integrity and unshakable faith.From His bold defense of the British soldiers who carried out the ''Boston Massacre'' to His refusal to take America to war with France. Many ''Historians'' like Sean Wilentz just to name one have panned this superb book saying that John Adams is no hero because He signed the blatantly unconstitutional Alien and Sedition Acts.The actions of Adams in this time of hysteria is no worse than Abraham Lincoln 's suspension of the Writ of Habeus Corpus or Woodrow Wilson's signing of the Espionage Act or Franklin D. Roosevelt's signing of Executive order 9066 authorizing the imprisonment of the Japanese-American community after Pearl Harbor.Adams later recanted his misdeeds which these other Presidents did not.My favorite parts of the book are the accounts of Adams relationship with His ''proto-feminist ''wife Abagail. And His lively correspondence in His later years with Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Rush among others. Their comments have just as much resonance today as they did then.In His introduction to the book McCulloch says that we can never know enough about Adams and the other Founders. I agree, just one of many reasons for reading this superb book.
