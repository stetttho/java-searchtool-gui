 David Kennedy has written a superb book that is  definitely worthy of the Pulitzer prize it has recieved. Professor Kennedy treats the Great  Depression and the second World War as unified events that constitute the  seminal event of the twentieth century.Kennedy gives a lucid account of the  causes of the Depression and gives one of the most accurate accounts of the  career of one of our most misunderstood Presidents, Herbert Hoover. Hoover  was in fact a Progressive Republican in the tradition of Theodore  Roosevelt.Hoover very much believed in  using government to fight the  depression. A case can be made that the New Deal was simply the logical  conclusion of Hoover's policies.The author is clearly a great admirer of  Franklin Roosevelt who He believes saved America twice.But at the same time  He is not blind to FDR's shortcomings. He readily concedes that the New  Deal, which ended around 1938, failed to end the Depression.The New Deal's  primary achieve- ment was a series of economic reforms which gave the  American people real security against future economic downturns.The book  also shows us the treacherous political minefield that Roosevelt led the  nation through in the runup to our entry into World War II. This book is a  very lengthy one but well worth the time it would take to read it.  Professor Kennedy's achievement is an awesome one and deserves to take it's  place alongside the Historical literature of this crucial period. I highly  reccomend it.
