 This is a short book but one I predict you may want to reread.We all know the story of how Winston Churchill rallied the British people in their darkest hour when they stood alone against nazi tyranny.What we did''nt know was how close it all came to falling apart, untilnow.John Lukacs one of the best Historians of the world war II era has by using recently released British archives shown us how the most crucial five days in the history of western civilization occured between May 24-29 1940 when the ''men of Munich''the defeatists in Churchill's cabinet began pressuring Him to seek a negotiated settlement with Hitler. This book is the story of how Churchill by the sheer force of His will and personality resisted them and finally won the inner cabinet struggle to continue the war. Had anyone else been Prime Minister it is highly unlikely that they could have pulled this one off. And the world of today would be one that none of us could scarcely imagine. A great book.
