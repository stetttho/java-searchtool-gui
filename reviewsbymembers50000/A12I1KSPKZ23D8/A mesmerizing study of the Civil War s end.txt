 Jay Winik has written a penetrating and mesmerizing  account of the Civil war's final month. Mr. Winik is a master storyteller who not only tells us what happened but also what might have happened except for some quirk of fate.He shows us how Lee very nearly escaped Grant's final encircling movement and what might have happened if Lee's army had linked up with Joe Johnston' army in North Carolina.He describes the  pressures that were brought to bear on Lee to continue the war if need be by waging guerrilla warfare. But Lee rejected this as being something that ''Christian men could never countenance''.But what would have happened if someone like Nathan Bedford Forrest or John Singleton  Mosby had been willing to lead such a movement? Winik provides a ready answer with the example of the border slave state of Missouri which by april of 1865 very much resembled Bosnia or Rwanda today.Confederate guerrillas carried out massacres of whole communities and union troops troops carried out reprisals with equal ferocity.Then there is the matter of Lee's surrender to Grant, one of the greatest and most sublime moments in American history. Why is it that Lee and Davis did not end their days before firing squads like the losers of all other civil wars? But were instead enjoined by General Grant to keep their horses and side arms for the ''spring plowing''.Is it just an accident of fate that at this crucial moment in our history we were blessed with such noble and compassionate leaders as Lincoln, Lee and Grant? As Lincoln said in the final week of His life ''The almighty has His own purposes'' I cannot reccomend this book highly enough. Wheather you are a civil war buff or not you will find reading this book a richly rewarding experience.
