 Jeff Shaara's new novel''Gone for Soldiers'' is a great read but at the same time inferior to His two previous novels. This is partly because the Civil War is missing.Also with the exception of Winfield Scott who is  masterfully portrayed here the other characters are not as fully developed  as they might be. Robert E. Lee comes off like a teen-ager just out of West  Point when in reality  He was almost 40 and a twenty year veteran of the  Corps of Engineers. Also some of the other characters simply cry out for  more attention especially Grant, Longstreet, Beauregard, Pickett etc. But  despite these criticisms this is a basically good novel and it has  apparently led to some serious study of the Mexican war.An episode in our  history that most Americans know very little about.I eagerly await Jeff  Shaara's next novel.
