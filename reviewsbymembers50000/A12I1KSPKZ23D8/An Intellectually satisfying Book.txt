 This is one of the most intellectually satisfying books that I have ever read.Might have beens are always great food for thought. But in the hands of superb Historians like Alastair Horne,David McCullough,James McPherson, Stephen Ambrose and Sir John Keegan what could have happened is an absolute feast. My favorites are on the Civil War and the second world war.James McPherson gives us a quite plausible scenario of how a Confederate victory might have been achieved had it not been for the loss of Lee's special order no.191 before the battle of Antietam.Tom Wicker gives a sobering picture of what might have happened if Lee had been persuaded by His artilllery commander Porter Alexander not to surrender but to wage guerilla warfare instead, Picture the U.S. like Lebanon or the Balkans or Northern Ireland.Stephen Ambrose shows us how close the D-Day invaision came to failing and how that might have changed the whole course of the war. But most fascinating and sobering of all is Sir John Keegan's analysis of how a slight change of direction in Hitler's  invaision of the Soviet Union could have resulted in a Nazi victory. It is a fascinating book and I highly reccomend it.
