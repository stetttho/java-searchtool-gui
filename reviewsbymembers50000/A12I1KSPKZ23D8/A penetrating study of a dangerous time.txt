 In the Dark valley Piers Brendon gives us a panoramic view of the 1930's and of the leaders and events that led the world inexorably toward World War II. The sweep of the author's wit and analysis remind one very much of Paul Johnson's  classic ''Modern Times''. Brendon clearly sees the Great depression as the seminal event of the era, the event which produced everything else. The thing that stands out most strongly in the book is the moral blindness of the world's leading democratic statesmen. With the exception of Winston Churchill they seemed oblivious to the threat posed by Hitler and the other Dictators. All of this is best summarized by a quote the author gives from George Orwell; Upon the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Orwell said''History is over and the age of propaganda has begun.''The most memorable chapter of the book is the one about the Stalinist purges of 1937-38.Brendon has left the madness and the evil of Stalin and His regime exsposed for all time. This book is not only a great read but also a cautionary tale that in our own day our belief in the essential goodness of man seems to have caused us to question the very exsistence of evil. That was the same mistake that was made in the thirties.
