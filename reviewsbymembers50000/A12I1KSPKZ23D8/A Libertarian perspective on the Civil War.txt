 Jeffrey Hummel has given us a concise and well written Libertarian's eye view of the Civil War.Professor Hummel's central thesis is that the civil war was the fruition of one of the principles of the American Revolution Human Freedom, but that it was a repudiation of the Revolution's other principles; self-determination federalism , limited government. The first part of the book gives an excellent survey of the causes of the war. Hummel is not a neo-Confederate.He makes it clear that slavery was an abomination and one of the war's central causes along with states rights vs. federal encroachment and the pursuit by both sections of economic self interest. Hummel believes that the war  was not inevitable had both sides been willing to live and let live.The book is well written and well researched with massive notes at the end of each chapter.But on a  number of points the author is simply not persuasive. He contends that without the war slavery would have died out by the end of the nineteenth century. I would like to believe this but something tells me it would not have happened. Also His assertion that the U.S. would be just as important a nation today minus the Confederacy does not ring true and ditto His Constitutional defense of the right of secession.But having said that there is more positive than negative to be said about this book.His documentation of Lincoln's massive assault upon civil liberties in the name of preserving the union is enough to cause one to rethink the Great emancipator.Hummel is certainly correct that the war brought on a massive exspansion of federal power which continues to this day and the jury is still out as to wheather that is good or bad.In the final analysis this is a thought provoking book. Wheather you agree with Hummel's arguments or not you cannot ignore. I would reccomend this book  only to those who want to be challenged to think about the seminal event in our history and all that has flowed from it.
