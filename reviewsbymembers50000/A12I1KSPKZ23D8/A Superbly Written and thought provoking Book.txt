 This is one of the best books about the Civil War to be written in a very  long time. It is literally food for the mind.Professor Weigley calls His  book a political and military history.But it is mainly a military history  and a brilliant one.Probably Weigley's most provocative statement is that  the South lost basically because of a failure of will.That is the Leaders  of the Confederacy both political and military were ambivalent about  secession and failed to do certain things that might have helped them to  prevail.He pronounces as the War's greatest illusion the Confederacy's  hopes of European intervention and shows why this was never in the cards.  Weigley comes to the defense of Generals like McClellan and Meade for their  failure to pursue the enemy after costly victories at Antietam and  Gettysburg by pointing out that no victorious General on either side ever  did this for very obvious reasons.In His analysis of the Battle of  Gettysburg the author says the major factor in Meade's victory was that the  Federal commander exercised sound judgement in His choice of subordinate  Generals to carry the battle,Reynolds,Hancock, Warren etc,while Lee  exercised very poor judgement in His choice of subordinates;Longstreet who  did''nt believe in the plan, Ewell who was entirely too cautious and Jeb  Stuart who simply was''nt  there.And of course Weigley indulges in the  mandatory comparison of the Generalship of Lee and Grant.He concludes that  Lee was the last of the Napoleonic Generals. Like His Hero Lee believed  that the purpose of war was to bring on battles and ultimately the one  great battle in which the enemy's army would be destroyed.Just as Napoleon  did at Austerlitz. So Lee spent the entire war in search of His own  personal Austerlitz and He never found it, though He came close at  Chancellorsville. Grant on the other hand considered Napoleon's strategy  obsolete and believed the purpose of war was to fight campaigns. A series  of battles in which the enemy's strength was gradually stripped  away.Weigley thus concludes that Lee's strategic concepts belonged to the  past while those of Grant belonged to the future. In other words Grant  would have been quite at home in the two world wars or any of the other  wars of the twentieth century.And finally as a son of Arkansas I am happy  too see that some notable Historian has finally given the Battle of Pea  Ridge some due recognition. Weigley calls it the war's most underrated  battle, The Gettysburg of the west.Again this is a superb book, a  magnificent reading experience.
