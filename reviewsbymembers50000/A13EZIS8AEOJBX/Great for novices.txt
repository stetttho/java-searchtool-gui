 Wish I'd bought this when I first started researching home theaters.  I was a novice, having purchased only a couple of 27" analog sets in the past 15 years.  Rather than starting with a book like this, I researched mine the time consuming way:  talking to knowledgable friends; wasting time with sales droids at electronic stores, reading home theater magazines.  About two months later things reached critical mass and I could finally make an informed decision. My advice: buy this book, read it, and afterwards *still* do what I did.  Only save the sales droids for last (by then you'll know more than they do), and look but don't buy.  Then go home and buy what you want at Amazon.
