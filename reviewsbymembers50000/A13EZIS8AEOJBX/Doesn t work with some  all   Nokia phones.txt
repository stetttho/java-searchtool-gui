 Some or perhaps all Nokias use a different incompatible 2.5m jack.  I didn't realize this until I bought this unit, which actually bears a sticker on the package saying it doesn't work with Nokia phones.  If you have a Nokia, I believe the correct unit is: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000059ZSL/ Beware the compatibility claim above that says it works with all phones!  Close to all, but not all.  :-)
