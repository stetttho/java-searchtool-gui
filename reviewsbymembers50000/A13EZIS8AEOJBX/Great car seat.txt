 I bought two of these units for my twin babies.  They are excellent car seats!  After the usual 20 minutes to figure them out the first time (standard for any new car seat), they install easily and quickly even when moving them from car to  car.  I can now move one from one car to the next in about a minute.  They also seem to have all the safety features that are advocated these days, including a tethering harness for autos that have the corresponding feature (see your car manual).  The tiltback adjustment is also nice for when baby wants to nap. I have also used these on airplanes and they are as nice there, except a bit harder to install (which is more the airlines fault than the car seat manufacturer).  It's easier for my wife who has smaller hands and arms to do the airplane installs.
