 This book isn't bad, but neither does it reach its mark.  My biggest complaint with it is that it is filled with hundreds of isolated and nonsensical "hello, world" type of examples.  Readers would have been better served with practical examples, especially ones chained together (i.e., exercises that build on previous ones). Also, for some odd reason the fairly straightforward concept of arrays isn't covered until mid-book.  As a result the first half of the book contains many gloss-overs like "it'd be cool to show you this nifty feature using arrays, but we won't discuss them until a later chapter."   Also conspicuously absent was a summary chapter at the end that brought together most of the ideas on the book, in a nifty sample application.   That said, of the 600 pages in this book, about 200 or so serve as useful references.  Perhaps you'd be better off buying a reference book though.
