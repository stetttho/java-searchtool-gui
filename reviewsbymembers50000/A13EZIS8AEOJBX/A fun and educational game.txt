 Ever wonder why we're not just happy - we're happy as a clam? Or why we don't just make an effort - we pull out all the stops? Why is it called a Caesar Salad or a Polka Dot? What does M.A.S.H. stand for? Why "Bikini?" Why "Oscar" or "Emmy?" Who said, "If you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen"?  Derivation is the modern, fresh, new game that centers on words, phrases, quotes, abbreviations (and more) that we use all the time. You'll get "hooked" because consciously or not almost everyone is fascinated about why we say many of the words and phrases that are a part of our everyday banter.  Playing is a snap. Players write down the origins of a word, phrase or name, the author of a quote or what an abbreviation stands for on the included "Suggestion Sheets." But you don't need to know the answer -- the game is even better when you invent fake derivations to try and fool your friends. Players earn a letter by knowing the correct answer, by choosing the correct answer and by creating the most believable fake answer!  The icing on the cake about buying Derivation is that Entspire donates some of its proceeds to very worthwhile charities.  Play and enjoy!
