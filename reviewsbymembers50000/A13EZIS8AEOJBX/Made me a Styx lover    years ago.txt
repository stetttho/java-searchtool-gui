 Sometimes a rare group cuts a rare album that is as good as a greatest hits album.  Styx pulled off this feat with Equinox, their first and in my opinion their overall best work.  Suite Madame Blue still gives me goosebumps each time I hear it.  This is classic 70's rock through and through.  Listen to the downloadable samples, and you'll end up buying it!
