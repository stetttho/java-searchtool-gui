 This is a cute book which dads, moms, and kids alike love.  It pokes a little gentle fun at us dads, but what the hey!  The cute sound effects from this watch-battery powered book make for an  intriguing tale that keeps baby at rapt attention.  My  favorite part is the stunning climax, in which Dad....well, you better buy it and find out.  :-)
