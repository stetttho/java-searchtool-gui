 I grew up in an Italian neighborhood in Chicago, and for the past 25 years since I moved away, I've pined to find great ethnic Italian sandwiches like those I was weaned on.  Nothing else I've tried outside Chicago comes as close as Salumi's.   I'm fortunate enough to work 2 blocks away, and I eat there twice a week.  Most sandwiches on the menu are superior.  I highly recommend getting whatever you order on what they call baguette (not what we Italians called it in Chicago :-) rather than the round flat bread.   Don't be intimidated by some of the exotic sounding sandwiches like oxtail (it's just delicious beef) or porchetta (it's delicious slow-cooked pork in a delicious juice).   Hot soprosato is a delicious and slightly spicy salami.  Ask the friendly workers to explain a menu item or recommend something. Don't forget to add cheese.  They charge $1.50 (at the time I write this) to add cheese, but it's worth it.  The mozorella is homemade, and the others are imported. I've referred dozens of people to Salumi's and not one has been close to disappointed.
