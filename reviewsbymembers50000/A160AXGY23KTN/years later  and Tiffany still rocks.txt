 I was 14 when this album came out. I can still remember how my female classmates went ga-ga over "Could've Been"....I still remember Tiffany performing I Think We're Alone Now on some talk show in December  1987.  This is a great eighties pop album by a girl who has a great voice  but was never allowed to grow as an artist.
