 ...Gone from this set are the cuts that would've rounded it out, such as live tracks, some hits, some MORE English songs that didn't come from the crossover CD, et cetera. Also, the CDs themselves could stand to be a little longer. Each one is about 30 minutes long - not like the people who put this together were hurting for space to put some more songs into this set.  Now, the good stuff: You can tell how old Selena was by the phrasing in her Spanish songs on this set. She sounds lovely as always, and this set is worth the money you'll spend. Some of the remixes on this set are worse than the originals; some are better. It's a mixed bag. However, I am not the typical Selena fan, so you won't get any gushy sentimentalism about how wonderful this set is simply because it's Selena. It is great, and it is Selena. ... it's actually very good. Buy it and judge for yourself.
