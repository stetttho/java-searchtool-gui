 This CD is the only Spanish-language CD that I own other than stuff by Selena Quintanilla Perez. It's different than Selena in that it is puro dance music.  I can only tell you that my least favorite song was the dance remix of Yo Quiero Bailar. I loved each and every song on this CD, I purely did. If you want a dance CD in Spanish, get this one, you won't be disappointed. I wasn't. It is money well spent.
