 Normally I do not like books by Diane Carey. She has done novelizations in the past which I have read, and I have thought them too short with not enough detail. However, this one book would turn me into a Diane Carey fan. I loved this book. I know, from reading a lot of the reviews before mine, that there are a lot of people who hated it because there wasn't enough TNG crew involved, they didn't like the ending, etc. Well, "Cause and Effect" is one of my favorite STTNG episodes (I have it on tape) and I always wanted to know what had happened to Captain Batesman (played by Kelsey Grammer) and his crew. One gets a glimpse of him in the Peter David book "The Captain's Daughter," but we see none of him in any other book. He is an engaging character that I would love to see in more books.  Simply put, I began reading this book a few minutes after I bought it, and I didn't put it down until I was finished with it (two hours later). I love it, I love the ending, I love his crew, and the biggest thing I love about this book is that it didn't have a bunch of characters that we already know in it. We got to meet a lot of new people with new stories. If you have a hankering for a ST book that doesn't have a lot of ST characters we already know in it, pick up this book. If you like quirky, smart characters, pick up this book. If you are looking for more Picard & Co. action, best leave it alone. But at least read it once.
