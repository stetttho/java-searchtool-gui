 I got introduced to Grupo Bryndis when one of my very nice Mexican neighbors lent me one of their CDs, the one with Mentiras on it. Fell in love on the spot. Well, I bought, without hearing any of the songs on it, En El Idioma Amor. Turns out, I love this CD too. It's a nice mix of ballads and cumbias and one "merequetengue." My favorites on this CD are Vas a Sufir; Te Amo, Te Extrano; Se Marcho; Felicidad; La Pregunta, the title track...okay, the whole CD. I admit it; I'm hooked. This is just a plain great CD. Get it any way you can and listen often. :-)
