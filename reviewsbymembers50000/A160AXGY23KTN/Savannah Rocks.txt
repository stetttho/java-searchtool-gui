 Hiya! One usually sees me reviewing Selena material, this time is a change. Another change is that this one is going to be short and sweet.:) Savannah's sound is great if you like 80's music. I especially like the title track for this album. :)) I also have one small complaint, and it's not about the album, it's about the "content" at the beginning of this page. It is taken verbatim from my friend Carol's site, which happens to be Savannah's official site.
