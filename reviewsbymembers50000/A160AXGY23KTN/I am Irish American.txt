 This book proved to me what I am. It's very, very strange to read about yourself/find yourself in a book written by a complete stranger who lives across the country from you. The difference, and the ONLY difference between the subject of the book and myself is that half of my half-Irishness is Anglo-Irish and the other half is Irish Catholic. However, if you've read this book, you know me and my family.  No, I don't drink, but I am the daughter of a CIA. I love drama, hate poetry. Since I'm female, I try to take care of everything, that's the way it is. My mother's that way, her mother was that way, my father's mother was that way... You probably get the picture right now without further explanation. The fact is this: I AM IRISH-AMERICAN.  Want to know more, read the book.  PS there are NO swollen heads in my family, and I have never forgotten where I come from.
