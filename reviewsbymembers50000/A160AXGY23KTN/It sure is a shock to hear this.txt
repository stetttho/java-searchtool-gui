 after hearing all the Anglicized versions of a lot of these songs. It is also a shock for those not used to real Tejano, as most of the songs on this CD are...someone once described Tejano as "polka with Spanish lyrics," and they weren't far off the mark. This CD goes along nicely with Todos Mis Exitos and Todos Mis Exitos II as Selena primers, for those who have never heard any Selena at all. The songs I love on this CD are "Costumbres," "No Quiero Saber," "Yo Fui Aquella" (which is a real shocker if you've only heard the version on Anthology, as I had before buying this CD--you will not expect this!), "Besitos," "Mentiras," "T Eres," and a sweet Spanish version of "Sukiyaki." If you like Selena and want to know what music she did before "Dreaming Of You," BUY THIS CD!! I love it :)
