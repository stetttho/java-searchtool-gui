 For real, it is. Here's why it is: Only one remix, and it rocks. 19 non-remixed songs, only remastered for better sound clarity. All the tracks on this CD, from 1-19, are all on Selena albums recorded while she was still alive - Ven Conmigo, Entre a Mi Mundo, Live, Mis Mejores Canciones, Amor Prohibido. Including "Buenos Amigos," which was NEVER before on a Selena CD. If you wanted it, and you lived in the US, you either had to download it or order Alvaro Torres' album, "Nada Se Compara Contigo," which is an import. If you've never heard a thing by Selena, and you're curious enough to want to buy a CD of hers, buy THIS one. You will not be disappointed...unless you're looking for rancheras, which are NOT on this CD. Looking for rancheras, then see her CD "Mis Mejores Canciones - 17 Super Exitos."
