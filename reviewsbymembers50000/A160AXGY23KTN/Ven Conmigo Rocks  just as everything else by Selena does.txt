 I bought this CD for a few reasons: (1) I heard "Yo Te Amo" on Live and it became one of my favorite songs by Selena (2) I run what is arguably the #1 Selena site on the internet, and I needed the CD because of that. Ok, so I love Selena. This CD is great for being one of her early CDs with EMI-Latin. It showcases Selena's beautiful voice on originals such as "Enamorada de Ti," "No Quiero Saber," "Aunque No Salga El Sol," etc. I like almost all the songs on the - it is great. If you're a Selena fan, get this CD (either that, or you probably have had it for years, I just got it yesterday). Selena once again proves that she can perform Tejano just as well as what could be classified as old-fashioned pop/rock (No Quiero Saber, Enamorada de Ti, Aunque No Salga El Sol). Like my banner says, SELENA ROCKS.
