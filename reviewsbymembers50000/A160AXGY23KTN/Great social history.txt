 this book recounts the history of a few groups in the US. One of them is the Irish, to which I belong. In this respect, it's a great book...one of the reasons I think this is because this book tells you why the Liberty Bell that we were all told about in school was rung for the first time, only to crack. Correction of one of Mr Sowell's statements: Tsar Nicholas II was not the tsar that freed the serfs of Russia. It was his grandfather, Tsar Aleksandr I, the "Tsar-Liberator," who was murdered by revolutionaries in 1881. Great book - interesting, factual, a great window on how various ethnic groups changed America, and how America changed them.
