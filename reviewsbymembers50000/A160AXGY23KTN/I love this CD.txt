 I just got the new Selena Live CD, The Last Concert, from [Amazon.com] Friday after watching the mail for days with baited breath to get it. I popped it in the DVD Rom and cried (literally) as I heard her record-breaking live appearance at the Houston Astrodome. On this CD, you will NOT hear Cumbia Medley, which was touted in the Selena Soundtrack CD cover as "recorded live at the Houston Astrodome" because it was not recorded in its eventual form at the Houston Astrodome, it was pieced together from the songs Selena performed at that concert and other performances. You will also notice that the "Disco Medley" sounds A LOT different here than it does on the Selena Soundtrack. (it's way better!...) It is also 7 seconds longer on this CD. My favorite song on this CD is Si Una Vez...which, if you've seen "Selena," is performed near the end of the movie by Jenniefer-Lopez-as-Selena. Oh, and by the way...you guys at EMI Latin are wrong about the timing of Como La Flor on this CD - you have it listed as being seven minutes, thirty-six seconds long, when it is actually six minutes, forty-one seconds long. ok, I will stop complaning...this CD is GREAT! If you even remotely like Selena, you should buy this CD and play it for everyone you know...they will then know why Selena is so popular, 6 years after her death, and why she would have been a huge star had she lived.
