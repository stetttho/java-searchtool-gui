 I first read 'Nicholas and Alexandra' in 1987 on a sick day from school. I loved it immediately and it began for me a lifelong interest in Russian Imperial history. I now have many books on the subject, but this is still one of the best, and it could also be considered the sequel to 'Nicholas and Alexandra.' It starts by describing how the grave was found, how it was excavated, what was done to the bones in the coroner's office in Ekaterinburg where they were stored. It describes the purely idiotic way that the team that eventually identified whose bodies they were were chosen (in such a way as to seriously offend the goverment of the US). Apparently the Russian team thinks that the missing daughter's body is Maria Nikolaievna, the American team thinks it's Anastasia Nikolaievna. (In 1918, a couple of days after the grisly execution, Yurovsky determined that two of the bodies, Alexei and his mother, should be dug up and burnt. Anastasia's body was burnt by mistake instead of her mother's. Decomposition had bloated the body to appear as that of a middle-aged woman.) Then the book describes how Anna Anderson, the woman who claimed since 1920 to be HIH Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaievna, was, once and for all, identified as the woman she was accused of being back in the '30s. Then it goes on to talk about the current Romanov family, and the current pretender to the non-existant Russian throne.  It is a must-have for any Russian Imperial history buff, and should be at least mildly interesting to people who like history.
