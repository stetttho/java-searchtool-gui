 The first time I read this book I was 9 years old. I was fascinated with  the heroine, Erienne. The poor girl has nothing that her father won't take  from her, and her father wants to marry her off to the richest guy he can  find. She sees Christopher Seton and gets a huge crush on him. The one man  she can't have because of troubles with her father. So she is sold on the  block to the highest bidder to a man whose face she does not see til the  end. A man who is good to her, buys her all kinds of clothes, and is  ultimately the man of her dreams. The fascinating thing for me now is  this: Have you noticed that most of KEW's heroines are Irish or of Irish  descent? Hmm... I have read almost all of KEW's other romances, and this  one, the first romance I ever read, remains the best one of all. Hey  Kathleen, will ya write a sequel like you did for "The Flame and the  Flower"?  I want to know what happened to Erienne and her love after  they were able to settle down and enjoy their life together. I want to know  what happened to Farrell and his girl. I want to know what happened to Lord  Saxton's people. Please, write a sequel!!
