 In this review, my intended audience is the proverbial choir. I am now watching the DVD of "V," which I first saw as a nine-year-old girl way back when. Back when "V" was originally aired, everyone I knew was floored, awed, and immediately "converted" by this very, very good story about an alien race infiltrating our lives and what the ones who don't like it do about it. This is a very, very great mini-series presented in movie format almost 20 years later. If you liked it when it first aired then this DVD is a must-see. Unfortunately, the DVD could have included the entire second mini-series and a ton more features than it does have (such as being able to choose Dolby Surround instead of being stuck with 5.1, which doesn't sound quite right when one doesn't have a 5.1-capable sound card in their computer). This is why I only gave four stars instead of five, considering that the whole movie deserves about eight stars. However, considering the rare quality of what amounts to a two-part made-for-TV movie (the story, the music, the acting, and the extraordinary special effects for the time period and format), buying this DVD is money well spent, for science fiction freaks as well as those who just like a great,...movie.
