 "My rider of the bright eyes, what happened to you yesterday? When I bought you your fine clothes, I thought you a man the world could not slay." I'd have never read those words had it not been for buying and reading this book. It is the story of how the Irish embraced Christianity and set about copying every book they could get their hands on...basically out of a educational greediness. Either way, they preserved the learning of centuries before for all of us, regardless of race or color. They did us all a big favor simply because they loved it. This book is loaded with poetry used to make a point. Look for the one about Pangur Ban the cat. People may not like this book because they say it's historically inaccurate, but so are the depictions of the Irish as apes and drunkards. I, and my family, are neither. (However, all of us are crazy.) It is entertaining, funny, sweet, sad. It's a good start into Irish history. It will make you laugh and cry at parts. I recommend it as an enjoyable, semi-educational read.
