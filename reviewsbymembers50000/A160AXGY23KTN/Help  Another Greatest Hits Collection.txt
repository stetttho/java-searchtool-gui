 This CD typifies the releases EMI has been subjecting us Selena fans to the past few years. Load a CD with Selena's greatest hits, one unreleased track and maybe a remix or two. I had twelve Selena CDs when I bought this one, and I wish I could have taken this one back as soon as I heard the alleged "new" stuff. I did not like this Selena CD at all. I already have three Greatest Hits compilations, I didn't need a another new one. I myself could have made a better Selena CD than EMI has just released to the unsuspecting public, nine years after her death.  It seems that EMI and the Quintanillas are still trying to profit from Selena's popularity long after they have run out of unreleased material.  If you already have "Ones," "All My Hits Vol. 1," and "All My Hits Vol. 2," don't buy this CD; you will be wasting your money. The "new" tracks are just not worth the money that you will be paying for it.
