 I usually rate ST: DS9 books pretty highly, but this one is an exception. The only reason I gave this book any stars at all is because I cannot submit this review without starring it. Here's why I feel this way: You would think that Mr. Friedman had never seen any episodes of Deep Space Nine. The characterizations of characters I feel I know personally are bloody awful. You would not recognize Jadzia Dax, Captain Benjamin Sisko, Major Kira, or any of the other characters from his characterizations of them. For example, Mr. Friedman has turned Jadzia Dax into a giggling, immature, bubble-gum-snapping, almost Valley-Girl speaking high-school chick. His portrayal of Captain Sisko is even worse. It makes me wonder if he hates the show. The actual story is very thin/flimsy. If you can get past the rotten depictions of the main characters, the story grabs your interest for about half of the book then fizzles out. And that, fellow readers, is generous. Speaking of thin, this book is very short and the lines of text are spaced far apart, no doubt to make the book appear have more pages than it would if the book was printed like all the other DS9/ST books I've read and own, and to make it appear to be longer than it actually is...or maybe that's just the copy I bought, I don't know. I have never, ever said this in any review I have ever written on Amazon.com (but there is a first time for everything): This book [is bad]! ...
