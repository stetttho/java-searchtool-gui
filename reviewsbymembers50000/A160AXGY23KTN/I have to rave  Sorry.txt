 Note: I usually review Selena items, but...well, just read this, okay? You'll understand why I had to recommend this to anyone who looks up this CD on Amazon.com. I haven't actually bought the soundtrack CD, just downloaded it in the glory days of Napster. However, I'd seen the movie when it was in theatres in 1993 and fell in love with the instrumentals. My favorite is "Happy Birthday Maggie," and it's my favorite instrumental of all time. I'm about to buy the CD from Amazon.com, because I desperately want a copy for myself. The instrumentals are just so beautiful and haunting that I have to have this entire CD.
