 This book will successfully clarify any queries that you have with regards to the correct usage of the verbs ser and estar, which traditionally present difficulty for learners of the Spanish language. When I bought this book a few years ago I was quite surprised with the level of detail and the approach of the authors used to clarify this grammatical difficulty. The explanations are in English with examples in Spanish. The approach of the logic of usage is from Spanish to English rather than from English to Spanish which most textbooks use and perhaps that's where the confusion begins. It does clarify the notion that Ser and Estar are sometimes interchangeable (and they are not) and using one or other will definitely change the meaning of a phrase. This is the only book that I have come across thus far dedicated to the analysis and usage of these two verbs. If you are looking for an accurate and concise clarification of the usage of these verbs this book is highly recommended and not to mention is very economical.
