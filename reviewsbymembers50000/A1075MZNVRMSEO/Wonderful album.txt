 I think Elvis Martinez has finally come into his own as a bachatero with great potential. With his new style carried over from his previous album this bachata has a little of everything to offer even to the most resistant bachata fans. This bachata is very contemporary sounding with a hint of some fusioned rhythms. Very danceable, very enjoyable to just listen to. Sit back and relax to this smooth sounding bachata by Elvis Martinez.
