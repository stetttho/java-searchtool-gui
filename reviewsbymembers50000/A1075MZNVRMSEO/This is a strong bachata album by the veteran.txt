 "La sangre llama" is quite an impressive cd by the veteran Luis Vargas. This album is full of charisma, sentimental lyrics and smooth bachata rhythms. I listened to it for the first time two days ago and I was impressed from the get go. This album is similar in style to his album titled "En persona" which I considered as Luis Vargas' change over to  a new style of bachata not characteristic of his older recordings. I can't give anything less than five stars since it was great through and through and the lyrics are very powerful. I think Luis Vargas is back and more competitive than ever. This is a beautiful album for bachateros.
