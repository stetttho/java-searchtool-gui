 Beyond a shadow of a doubt Medicina de amor is Raulin's landmark album. He is my favorite bachata artist among many that I listen to. However, I always seems to pull out of one of his when I want to listen to bachata exclusively. Raulin who writes his own music is one of best representatives of modern bachata and definitely is unique in style. This album has the forever popular "Medicina de amor" but the beauty of this album does not stop there. All the songs are terrific and the lyrics really hit home. Maria Luisa and Que vuelva are also true examples of bachatas that are sung from the heart. With the surge of bachata music and bachateros like Raulin Rodriguez Dominican culture from a music perspective should get the recognition that it deserves. That is where bachata originated with a requinto or a guitar and bachata from anywhere else is a poor imitation. I hope you enjoy this cd and I encourage you try some of his others: Soledad, Corazon Corazon, Sin Fortuna, and Arrancame la vida just to mention some other wonderful albums in his collection.
