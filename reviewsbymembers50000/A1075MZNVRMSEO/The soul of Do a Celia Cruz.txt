 It is a great joy to be able to say a few words about this CD and the late Celia Cruz who left behind her heart and soul in the name of "salsa" and"son" two genres of tropical music that she mastered over an incomparable fifty year musical career. Regalo del Alma is a true gift. The gift of soul, cubanismo, sentimentalism and showcase of  true love for tropical music and rhythms. I expected this album to be a platinum production just because of the circumstances under which it was initiated and finished. Once again Celia dared to be different but yet contemporary at the same time. Undoubtedly this is a salsa album but as usual Celia's albums always incorporate songs with other rhythms which shows her diversity across the genres. I liked the whole album. This is another one of hers where you can listen to whole cd and hit repeat afterwards. However, I would like to highlight a few songs that really made me laugh and just reminded that life is to be enjoyed (which is her philosophy). They are: Me huele a rumba, No ests amargao and Pa'la cola. In terms of the musicality just like "La negra tiene tumbao" this album has a lot of sounds that are more associated with Cuban salsa in particular. Especially the noted use of the "maracas" and la "clave" two instruments that distinguish Cuban salsa. This album is a treasure and not because I am a loyal fan of Celia Cruz but because this is just downright terrific salsa. Celia has left her footprints and this final album has a message from Celia which is: Re y Llora because that's what life is all about. I will always be a fan of her music- high respect!
