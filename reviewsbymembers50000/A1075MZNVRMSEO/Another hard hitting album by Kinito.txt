 When I discovered this new album by Kinito Mendez instinctively I new that it would be to my liking. This merenguero already has a fifteen year musical career and they have been fifteen years of success. This album, his latest production is no exception. I listened to it for the first time last week and what pleasure it was for me. The album contains all the components of good merengue. Teasing lyrics, catchy rhythms, creative sounds and distinct nuances which include the fusion of merengue and bachata which sound quite good. All of which will leave you with inkling to do one thing: dance like never before! I guarantee you, once you listen to the cd, you will let it play until the last song and possible repeat the cd. The album is truly wonderful. This one by Kinito Mendez is a special tribute to his most loyal fans and with this album he will continue to be "the man of merengue". If you like merengue Kinito Mendez style purchase this new release.
