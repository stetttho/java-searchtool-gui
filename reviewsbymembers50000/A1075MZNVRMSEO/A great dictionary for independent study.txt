 I stumbled across this dictionary in a Cuban bookstore in Miami last month, which appeared to be old when I was browsing through the contents but I decided to buy it nevertheless. It has truly been helpful and it gives a broad range of Cuban vocabulary, examples of usage and where possible the origin of the word or expression. This dictionary, which is one in a series of many, is a lasting resource, as expressions, slang and colloquial speech never completely become extinct in a language. This dictionary is arranged alphabetically thus making the vocabulary easy to locate. It's quite detailed and definitely will shed some light and clarify understanding of words if you are unfamiliar with Cuban colloquial Spanish. If you can purchase it from Amazon great, otherwise there are plenty of similar dictionaries on the market. This is a helpful reference for those who want to understand and know Cuban colloquialisms. This dictionary is terrific for independent study.
