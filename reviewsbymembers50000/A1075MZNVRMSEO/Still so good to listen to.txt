 This is a wonderful edition of the Salsa en la Calle 8 series and is still so nice to listen to if you want to hear relaxing salsa. This is a fine line up of "good pure salsa" from various artists who each have a very unique style. It's a very good mix as well because there is not one song that really dominates over the other. All can be listened to as background music and some are definitely more danceable than others. For example: Anhelo, and Mi Libertad but overall these salsas are for those who wish to listen to this genre rather than dance to it. There is a recording error however. Song # 5 by Tito Rojas is not "Te quedaras conmigo" but rather "Cuando estoy contigo" from his album "Por derecho propio". So if you are expecting the former it is not on this album. Once again this is a great recording. Try to ascertain a copy while you can and most of all enjoy it!
