 This book is very up to date, well organized, concise and details a wide variety of expressions, phrases and idioms that are used in Latin America with examples of its usage. I would recommend this book to Spanish speakers at any level both native and non-native since the Spanish language is so diverse. It would serve as handy reference guide to understanding everyday speech, colloquialisms and slang. The second half of  the book details common English expressions with the equivalent Spanish interpretation, thus enabling the speaker to authenticate his/her Spanish speaking capabilities instead of attempting to translate word for word. Both teachers and students will learn frequently used expressions as well as the intended meaning thus enhancing their ability to understand speakers from various countries, as well implement the use of these idioms in their everyday speech.  I am a Spanish teacher and strongly recommend this book of expressions to anyone who wishes to bring their competencey in Spanish to the next level.  This is a  worthy purchase and a quality language reference.
