 This salsa is all that it's expected to be. Typical Sonora Carruseles all the way. High energy, fast rhythms, excellent percussion, fusion of beats and most of all their trademark of "boogaloo" style salsa is noted throughout the album. I never had a doubt about this album when I purchased it but I was quite surprised. Not because of how great the album is but because how they are able to maintain the high quality of salsa that they produce. If I were to compare this album to another one in their repertoire I would say this one is similar to their previous production "De una vez gozando".  Several songs caught my attention. I especially enjoyed #1- La salsa la traigo yo, #3 La Comay, #6 Repica el tambo, #7 Lo que pide la gente, #9 Rumba de mulatos, #10 Me goce el bongo, #11 Puras mentiras and #13- Amor mexicano- a beautiful, top notch cumbia. As you can see I almost listed all thirteen songs as my favorites. In a nutshell, if you know Sonora Carruseles style salsa or if you own their other albums: Heavy Salsa, Con todos los hierros, De una vez gozando or The Best (greatest hits compilation) shall I say no more. Just buy the album because as the title states "Sonora Carruseles te trajo la salsa" and it is to be enjoyed!
