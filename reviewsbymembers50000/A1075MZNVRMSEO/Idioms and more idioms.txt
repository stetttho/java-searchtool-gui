 This book should be part of a student's essential reference material collection. Idioms are difficult to grasp in any language and Spanish is no exception. This resource has many of the most commonly heard idioms in day to day speech and those learning Spanish must eventually learn the meaning and use them when speaking Spanish. Understanding and learning fixed expressions authenticates one's usage of the language and brings an individual one step closer to native competency. I seriously recommend this resource for Beginners and Intermediate level students. For advance speakers I think a more challenging resource would be more beneficial to their development in the language. I recommend the McGraw-hill Diccionario del Argot: El Sohez for advance level students.
