 This compilation by Platano Records can be easily considered a collector's item. Once again they have compiled the best of the best bachatas of our time thus creating a fantastic production and a fine display of musical talent. If you are familiar with the "bachateros" of today you will appreciate hearing some of the finest of all on one cd and if you are new to bachata this is an excellent intro to a musical genre that has it roots in the Dominican Republic but is now gaining international popularity. This volume is very similar to "Aqui esta la Bachata vol 7." in the sense that it is a very romantic compilation of bachatas and it has songs from the greatest singers of this genre. All the songs are bachata except for "El Colin" which is merenbachata typical of Antony Santos. I think that "Aqui esta la Bachata vol 8." is an outstanding compilation worthy of any music lover's patronage. I highly recommend this cd.
