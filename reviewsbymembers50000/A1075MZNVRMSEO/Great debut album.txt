 Frankely, unknown to the world of bachata presents his first album which definitely has potential without a doubt. I bought it not knowing what to expect and I must say I am not disappointed. The album contains very melodic and danceable bachatas all with very sentimental lyrics. I was also surprised by the above average acoustical arrangements which stand out in every song. This is definitely a worthy purchase. The cd contains great bachatas, some very danceable by a bachatero who without doubt has a great future singing this genre of music. The cd also includes two merenbachatas- # 6 & #12 which could have been omitted without reducing the quality of this album. In summary this cd is a great debut for this artist.
