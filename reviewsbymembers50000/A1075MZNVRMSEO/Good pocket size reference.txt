 This is a handy pocket size dictionary of Spanish synonyms and antonyms. It has a wide variety of words and an extensive selection of synonyms and antonyms, which gives the student, reader or researcher an ample choice of alternate vocabulary. It does give reference to figurative and familiar usage and where possible countries where the particular word or words are used. The dictionary does not give examples of usage in sentence, which is vital to ensure that the reader understands how to use the word in the proper context. I would recommend this dictionary to strong intermediate students, advanced students, Spanish professionals and those who are pursuing independent study in Spanish. Overall, it's a handy reference and you will definitely expand your vocabulary by using it.
