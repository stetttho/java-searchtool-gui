 This DVD of el Mayimbe en vivo is the next best thing to being at the concert. First of all I like the line up of songs. It is a nice mix of old and new Antony Santos bachatas. As well, the artist has charisma. From the get go the crowd was enthusiastic and el Mayimbe kept his followers happy by giving an inspirational performance. I am not sure where the location was. I assume somewhere in the Dominican Republic. I am looking forward to the DVDs of other live performances. The on screen view is very clear and the audio is very good as well. In a nutshell, he was awesome ...but then again from el Mayimbe, I would expect nothing less.
