 I purchased this cd with the anticipation of it being a tremendous compilation of great bachata music and once again J & N records has out done themselves. Bachatahits 2003 is a fine display of the best of bacahta throughout 2002 and some surprise selections have been included as well in the cd that really makes the compilation a special treasure. If you like bachata you will immediately take note of the line up of artists- Monchy & Alexandra, Aventura, Alex Bueno, Rauln Rodrguez among other greats. These artists have become popular among fans everywhere and all I can say is prepare yourself for a nice "bachata listening session" because there will be no need to skip or pause once you start listening to this album. Every song has been carefully selected thus making the cd a bachata lover's delight. If you do purchase Bachatahits 2003, I assure you, you will enjoy every inch of it! Other great compilations: Bachatahits 2001 & 2002.
