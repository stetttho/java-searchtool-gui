 This group is always upbeat, jovial, lively and in this album they really have taking this style of merengue of theirs to the next dimension. This cd is just pure fun- that's the best way I could describe the line up of songs. Ranging from the lyrics to the acoustics, Rikarena has put together an album that is suitable for all types of merengue followers. This group is "los potros" de Kinito Mendez and believe me when they say "sacudete que tiene arena" you will be with shaking it because these merengues are "locos". All the songs are good but my personal favorites are : #1,5,6,8,9,10. As you can see almost the whole cd. I would say that this group is a cross between "Zafra Negra" and "Rokabanda". Try to purchase this one while you can.
