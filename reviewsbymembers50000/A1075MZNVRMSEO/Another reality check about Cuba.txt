 El Rey de la Habana is one of the many books that have become increasingly popular about the portrait of the "real Cuba" that most tourists and outsiders do not see nor hear about. This book is raw and spares no expense when it comes to describing the life of Rey, a young Cuban street boy who struggles to survive life on the streets by stealing, abusing his body and basically prostituting himself (for fun and natural desires only not for money) as he moves from town to town just hoping to beg for enough money for at least one day's meal. The Cuba portrayed here is representative of the urban street life of many young Cubans both male and female who are forced to adopt this life style at a young age when faced with numerous adversities. A Cuban himself wrote the book so the picture could not be more real. Prepare yourself for some harsh and vulgar language, drug abuse and unlimited female encounters. Out from his ability to clean up streets and women he is know as "El Rey de la Habana". This is a sad portrait but a very true one in country that has forced its citizens to live impoverished and destitute lives. This is a well written novel in my opinion because the author did write the book using the everyday speech of these "street people". I suggest reading the book in Spanish only and purchasing a dictionary of Cuban colloquialisms because there are plenty and the meaning can not be assumed. Otherwise it is a great read and I don't think a translated version can retain the rawness and crudeness of the language.
