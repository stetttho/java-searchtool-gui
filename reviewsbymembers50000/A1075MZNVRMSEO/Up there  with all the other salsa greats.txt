 This is another great production by Miles Pea as he has now come into his own and has developed a style of salsa that is really unique, rhythmic and melodic. In this album and in his previous recording "Mis ideas", Miles has created what can be called "blended tropical rhythms" because one can clearly hear the blend of traditional salsa along with cuban sounds and a contemporary "sonero" style in his salsa. I think Miles Pea's music is underrated by those who promote salsa however hopefully not underrated by his listeners because his music is definitely "up there" with the other more popular salsa artists such as: Victor Manuelle, Mark Anthony, Pedro Jesus, Cesar Aviles & Dominic. His music definitely falls into the category of "romantic salsa" but with a cuban touch which can be heard in all the songs. Although this salsa album is predominately romantic in nature they all are quite danceable songs and can be enjoyed by salsa followers, those who enjoy dancing to salsa music as well as those who are new to tropical rhythms. Overall this is a wonderful production. Don't hesitate to try it. Some of the key songs are: "Solito, solo", "Me pasa igual a m", "Lejos de ti" y "Mentiras" (tremenda cancin para los bailadores). Do enjoy!
