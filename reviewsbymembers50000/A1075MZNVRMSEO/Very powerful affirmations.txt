 I discovered this book three years ago and the passages are very inspiring. They force one to reflect upon life and the world in general. Although the book is directed toward the black race I am really opposed to that aspect. I think it should be directed toward the "human race". One's religion, race and beliefs have no bearing when it comes to "Actos de fe". The book has affirmations and spiritual messages that will uplift anyone in the pursuit of successfully managing a crisis and day-to-day ups and downs of life. Moreover, it's a guide to managing and facing crisis on a personal level. The passages in the book are convincing and are the perfect remedy for a destroyed soul, for a person who is feeling down, for those who are ill and hope to recuperate their health and simply for those who need a little uplifting so that they can survive and face life. It's a great motivational tool that is appropriate for any human being. This book is available in Spanish and English.
