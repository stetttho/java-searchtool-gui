 Just like all his other albums this one is terrific but I seriously doubt that it received the recognition that it deserves because this production is from before most bachata followers knew Frank Reyes. The album that instigated his popularity is Vine a decirte te adios but this one definitely is of high quality. All the bachatas are good which is not an easy task; all are danceable and basically are just love songs. If you are fan of Frank Reyes I am sure you understand the unique talent of his that I am describing.  There are three merengues (the last one is not on the cover). I really like Cantos a los ninos. What a beautiful merenbachata. This album can definitely mesmerize you quite fast; the rhythms are catchy with a steady tempo.  The hit bachatas on this album are: A quien tu quieres, no te quiere, A mi retorno, Regreso mi amor bonito and No es una locura. If you are fan of Frank Reyes and you like romantic bachata this album will definitely please you.  He is definitely el Principe de la bachata.
