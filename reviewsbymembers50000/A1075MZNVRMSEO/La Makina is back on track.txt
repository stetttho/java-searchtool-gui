 In a nutshell, this is a terrific album. I was fortunate to hear "Celosa" on Merenhits 2003 and I became very curious about the rest of the album. This is the best I have heard from La Makina in a while. This album is full of rhythmic and very catchy tunes. These are all components that made La Makina a popular and competitive group in the merengue market. This album has two types of merengue: PR caribbean style with very nice traditional sounding acoustics and secondly merengues "suaves" . This subtle blend of styles is very impressive leaving you with the option to dance or simply enjoy the beauty of the more romantic merengue tracks on the album. I was particularly captivated by "Maria Maria Maria", "Celosa" and "Cul es tu orgullo" -what a song! Basically, it is safe to say that La Makina is back on track...sbete, sbete con La Makina.
