 This edition of Salsa Hits will definitely please all types of salsa enthusiasts. The cd has a very impressive beginning. Meaning the first five songs are fast, up beat, high energy salsas which are suitable for those who are looking for a compilation with contemporary salsa for dancing. Then from song #6 onward the album slows down completely with a series of romantic to mid tempo pace salsas which are great for those who prefer to listen to this genre of music. I think the selection of songs is representative of the contemporary hits and many have become popular over the past 2 years. If you are a regular follower of salsa music you will recognize at least half of the songs due to popularity. The oldest one being "Micaela" by Sonora Carruseles which came out in 1998. I think the sequence of songs could have been more carefully contemplated meaning not grouping most of the fast songs sequentially and then slowing the cd down tremendously which definitely breaks the flow. Otherwise Salsa Hits 2003 is a great cd for dancing, listening, relaxing and can be enjoyed by all who are keen about salsa music. Please do enjoy this great compilation cd. Believe me the good ones through and through are scarce and hard to find. Don't miss out on this one. I also personally recommend Salsa Hits 2002.
