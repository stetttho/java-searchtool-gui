 Just have to say that Bachatahits 2005 is a must have compilation cd for all bachata fans. The best of best in 2004 and into 2005 is part of the line up of songs. This a fine display of bachata artists who have proven their talent over the past few years i.e. Monchy & Alexandra, Yoskar Sarante, Wilbert Manuel and of course fan favorites and regulars Raulin Rodriguez, Joe Veras and Frank Reyes. This is one is a keeper. You will not be disappointed.
