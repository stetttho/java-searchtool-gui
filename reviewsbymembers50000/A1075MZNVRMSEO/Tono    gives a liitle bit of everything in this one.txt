 Out of all Tono Rosario's albums this one is the least listened to of my collection although it's a good album. I think Tono included too many rhythms in one album including a salsa track for the first time and I must say this is not his genre or area of expertise. However, as expected the merengues are sweet and for dancers are just a delight. The two that really stand out are "Tu va vei" and "Estoy contento de estar en mi pais" but there are many other great ones as well. Tono knows how to catch your attention and this album will do just that for the variety that it has to offer. Tono included a merengue apambichao which is the most tradicional you can get in terms of merengue. This album a true example of "el cuco's" diversity but is not one of his bests. I think he has out done himself so many times that it becomes a greater challenge for him to rise above his great work. Nevertheless this is a tremendous album. Other vintage classics are: Amor Jollao, Seguire and Quiero Volver a Empezar.
