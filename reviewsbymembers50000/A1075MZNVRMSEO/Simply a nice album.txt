 Admittedly I was never a fan of or familiar with Enrique's Iglesias's music however I became interested in purchasing this cd because of two songs, Rhythm Divine and Bailamos both had much radio popularity. I must say I was presently surprised with all the songs in this album. I presume it's safe to place this type of music under the category "latin pop" which is a genre that I traditionally stay away from but this album from Enrique Iglesias has the potential to be everlasting in the sense that the album does reveal some talent and because this album is predominantly English, Enrique has become more internationalized whereas before he was more common among a smaller group of chosen fans. The songs on this album are simple and mellow. The album is suitable for listening or can be used as relaxing background music in an appropriate setting. If you already have this album, thanks for reading this and if don't I hope you will consider buying it. It may just be one of the best ones that he has produced thus far in his career.
