 Although I do not listen to this genre of music as often as before and have not for many years, I must say at any given time I were to begin listening to R&B/soul again seriously, Anita Baker's music would be one of my first choices. This album Sweet Love is the essence of "everlasting" contemporary soulful music sung by a singer whose voice is like no other. After being in the market for years which seems like a lifetime but definitely over fifteen it's still so good to listen to. This is certainly an album that's timeless, priceless, precious, inspirational and soulful. If you are looking for modern, soulful R&B give this one a try. R&B albums are certainly not of this caliber anymore. It's seems like Anita Baker is on a permanent career hiatus but she sure left her legacy behind. Thank you Anita, your talent has not gone unrecognized!
