 This edition of the Merenhits series is a good compilation of merengues that were popular in 2000 & 2001. I bought the cd to maintain the collection that I have starting with Merenhits'94 and thus far J & N records has not disappointed me. This particular cd can be listened to non stop and you will enjoy it thoroughly especially if you like contemporary merengue. Many of the popular groups and their hit song have been included in this cd and coincidentally some of the songs have similar rhythms. The merengues are very upbeat but mid-tempo and fall into the category of nightclub style merengue. I particularly like this cd because of it's variety. I have always been a fan of hard hitting merengue but over the years I have come to appreciate "romantic merengue" and there are some nice tracks on this cd such as "Pgame tu vicio", Jams podr olvidar" and "Cuando el amor se daa". I liked Andy Pea's "Burro"-a very unique mixed rhythm of bachatamerengue. "Advina", "No me digas que no" and "Dile" are some nice merengues to dance to as well. There is one surprise bachata and a nice one too-Llora alma ma. Once again if you are fan of contemporary merengue and are looking for a nice nightclub style cd for listening and dancing this edition of Merenhits is a worthwhile purchase. (Anda y cmpratelo).
