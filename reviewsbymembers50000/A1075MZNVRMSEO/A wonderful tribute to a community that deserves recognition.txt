 I wanted to be the first person to review this book however the first reviewer wrote a wonderful review so I will gladly take second place. "Cuban time" is a wonderful tribute to Cubans and the Cuban culture that has been maintained by the exile community predominately in Miami. This book captures the essence of what Cubans left behind in search of a "free" life outside of Cuba. The book is tribute to their music, food, dance, language, soul and spirit. If you don't know about Cuban Americans purchase this book, which will enlighten you about the beautiful aspects (that we don't hear enough about) of Cuban culture. The book is bilingual side-by-side therefore you can choose to read it in English or Spanish. This book is truly a celebration of Cuban Life in America as the title states and for once it's the positive side that is portrayed of a community that has contributed tremendously to the city of Miami and to the USA in general. Pa'lante mis hermanos cubanos.
