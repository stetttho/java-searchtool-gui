 Monchy & Alexandra are truly talented singers. This album in my opinion is somewhat more mellow than their previous two but nevertheless a very romantic and a heart felt bachata cd. The vocals are very strong and the lyrics are meaningful. There were a few songs that caught my attention like "Perdidos", "Hasta el fin","Los recuerdos no abrazan" and "Baby, Olvidame". This is a great album for romantic bachata fans.
