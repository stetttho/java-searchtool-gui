 Undoubtedly this is the best book that I have ever read about this theme. Meaning, Cuba itself, prostitution, balseros, sentiments about the Cuban revolution and the desperation that Cuban's feel to better their life. The book presents the above-mentioned themes in a captivating way via the two main characters, Daniel and Aneylin. "La noche de la jinetera" is about the love affair of Daniel Pos, a journalist and writer who travels to Cuba to investigate the murder of Estanis Marimon, a journalist as well who was doing a report on Spaniards in Cuba. The story slowly develops via the two protagonists Daniel and Anyelin, the prostitute who falls in love with him with the hopes of being able to leave Cuba and have a better life. The book also deals with three other related events related to the Cuban revolution that develop in the midst of Daniel's investigation. There's a protest against the Cuban regime, an attempt against Castro and the Cuban runaway crisis. For me the book is a portrait of modern Cuba, we see the lives of the prostitutes and convincingly we get a glimpse of the daily life of Cubans who are struggling to survive in an oppressed country. The story was heartfelt because it made me think if these prostitutes or jineteras as they are now called can really love someone without people thinking that they have an ulterior motive and that they are just taking advantage of the Spaniards who come to enjoy unlimited pleasures with women. I enjoyed the book but it also left me with a very disturbing feeling about the way these young Cuban females are forced to live.  I recommend this book if you would like to know more about their world that is totally different, sad and risky but for these prostitutes it is just a way life.
