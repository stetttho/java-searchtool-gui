 Platano Records  put together a superb sixth edition of this series titled "Aqui esta la bachata" . I am proud to say that volume 6 is just as great as all the others. After listening to the album, I would say the theme of this compilation cd is "romantic bachata" from the best of today's bachateros. The cd has songs from well known artists such  as Anthony Santos, Raulin Rodriguez, Luis Segura and from younger upcoming sensations such as Willy Castro and Reidy "el torito".  For those who like the sound of merengue "tipico", the cd contains two nice tracks- one by Bartolo Alvarado and the other by Agapito Pascual. The only downfall in this album is first song, it totally does not belong in compilation but if you like romantic bachata, strong beats and a taste of the different styles, I recommend the purchase of this cd. It can be enjoyed by all bachata fans without a doubt from start to finish. Overall it is a great production!
