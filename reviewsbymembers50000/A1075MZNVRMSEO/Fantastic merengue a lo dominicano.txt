 This album is a display of talent by one of world's most renowned merengue bands who over years have reduced in size, down to a three man group but have not reduced in quality. Over the many successful years of their musical career Los Hermanos Rosario have dominated the style of merengue known as "merengue puro" and this album is one of if not the best example of this style merengue that has sensationalized the Dominincan Republic and fans from all over the world. The group is lead by the powerful voice of their lead singer Rafa Rosario and accompanied by many other backup vocalists of high caliber. The album will definitely remind you of the pure sound of merengue that is not part of the musical components of today's merengue but definitely a sound that's specific to its roots and is so typical of the true dominican rhythm. In this album Los Hermanos Rosario also display their musical flexibility by dazzling us with a well sung bolero "En cuarentena" and a very danceable salsa "Otro ocupa mi lugar". This album is a classic and if you can still obtain a copy it would be a worthy addition to your music collection. It is a just a wonderful reminder of how beautiful "true merengue" is and best of all by Los Hermanos Rosario. Que se respete.
