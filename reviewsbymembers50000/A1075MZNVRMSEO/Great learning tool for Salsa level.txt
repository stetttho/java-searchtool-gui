 This video is great for intermediate-advanced level salsa dancers who want to learn or sharpen their salsa variations. The video features Josie Neglia and her assistant who are excellent at breaking down each step both male and female and once completed they dance the variation to music at least twice. The moves are classified as level III & IV salsa and indeed they are intermediate to advance steps. The video goes through each routine clearly and concisely which prevents the viewer from being overwhelmed. This video can meet the needs of salsa dancers who are at the intermediate level and wish to perfectionize their moves and beginners who are ready to try more difficult steps. I strongly recommend this video as it displays great choreography, coordination and is well organized from start to finish.
