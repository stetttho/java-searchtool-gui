 When I purchased this book I thought it would be similar to many on the market that just tend to be superficial and not really helpful. Surprisingly, however, it contains many illustrative details and plenty of helpful tips for couples that are experiencing difficulty in their relationship on an intimate level. The chapters are clearly defined, thoroughly discussed and provide some valuable suggestions for improvement that could be beneficial even to couples that are not encountering problems of this nature. Myths are discussed and challenged and throughout the book male and female sexuality differences are constantly mentioned which seems to be the basis for most problems that couples experience with regards to intimacy. I read the book just to read it and it turned to be realistic and quite informative.
