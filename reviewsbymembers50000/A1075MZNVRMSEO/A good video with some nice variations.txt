 My first reaction after watching the video was positive. I thought that Josie and her partner demonstrated useful and advanced salsa variations that can be learned in time and with practice. Before considering learning some of the variations, I watched the video a second time and I was still pleased with the moves, the presentation, breakdown and execution of the salsa variations. Many of them are common, meaning I had already learned them, currently dance them and regularly see the variations executed by salsa dancers here in Toronto. If you are not looking for a flashy background in the video, background salsa music and high energy you will be please with it. It's simple, the steps are well executed and broken down and the variations are advanced moves because you have to have excellent rhythm, timing and body control to dance them properly once learned. This a great video for those looking to continue learning more salsa moves and for those who need a refresher from time to time.
