 Once again J & N Records has outdone themselves with their yearly compilation of merengues under the well know series "Merenhits". Well, hits they are indeed because the cd is filled with best-sellers from some of the most popular merengue artists today. What I like about the Merenhits compilation is that it presents a diverse mix of groups as well songs therefore each one is unique while offering a different musical element that enhances the cd. Merenhits 2002 has merengues from every category ie. fast, slow, nightclub, bachata-merengue and traditional style. This is a great cd for dancing or for listening but however you look at it they are "merengue hits". I highly recommend this compilation cd. You'll enjoy it from start to finish.
