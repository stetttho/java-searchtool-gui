 I saw this dictionary last month at Borders and I had to own it. The only deterrent was the price. Without giving up hope I decided to purchase it from Amazon and not only was it half the amount but I was happy to know that I would be able to ascertain this fantastic resource. This dictionary is unilingual, diverse, and provides examples of usage of every word in the dictionary. This dictionary is from the University of Salamanca which is the oldest university in Spain and the most reputable in terms of preserving the Spanish language. It also classifies the words where applicable. For example, if the word has a restricted use, regional use, considered vulgar, pertains to medicine etc. which is extremely helpful when trying to choose the most appropriate word. Also with adjectives it indicates whether it is normally used before or after a noun in some cases both positions are acceptable in Spanish. I own a version of the Real Academia about the same size as this dictionary and this one is better by far. The definitions are clear, concise with examples and idioms that really clarify the meaning. You can't go wrong with this dictionary. Not only is it a great reference to research the meaning of words but you will definitely expand your vocabulary by using it. This is one of most thorough dictionaries that I own. I sincerely recommend it.
