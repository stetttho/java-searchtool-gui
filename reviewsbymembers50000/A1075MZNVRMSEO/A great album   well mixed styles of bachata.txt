 This was the first bachata cd I purchased many years ago and it had an impact on me. These songs will never grow old because the artists are great and some the songs have become all time favorites. This series by Platano records always start off with one song by el Mayimbe- Antony Santos and the second by Raulin Rodriguez; two bachata giants. The rest of cd includes other popular artists who are  also fine representatives of this rhythm that is exclusive to the DR. The whole album is good, the non bachata rhythms could have been omitted but over all this is a terrific compilation cd. It includes the big hits of the day such as: Por mi timidez, Medicina de amor, Que vuelva and Corazon Culpable.
