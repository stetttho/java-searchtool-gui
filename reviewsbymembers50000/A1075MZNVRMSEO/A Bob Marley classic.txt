 This album in my opinion is a Bob Marley classic. His music transcends many cultures and as usual tells a story and many generations to come will be able to relate to what is being told. Bob Marley is a pillar of classic reggae music that has slowly changed over the years but this genre of reggae is still best exemplified by this great legend. This one is one of the best of his originals and what a great production it is. The lyrics are so strong and the political message is will sent. If you really listen to what is being said it still applies to what is happening around us today. The songs have great rhythms, tremendous acoustics and classic reggae beats through and through and as a result this album can be played in completion and repeated. My favorites on this album are: Who the Cap Fit and Rat Race (for it's strong message to humanity) but all in all this album is well polished (until the color of man's skin is of no more significance than the color of eyes...powerful lyrics).
