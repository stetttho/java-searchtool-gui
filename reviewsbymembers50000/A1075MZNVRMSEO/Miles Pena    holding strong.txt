 This is a lovely album by Miles Pena. This Cuban salsero is in form and this cd complements the previous two. In this one he repeats the formula that has lead him to success, which is blending contemporary salsa with a touch of Cuban son. No surprises here this is typical Miles Pena salsa- not too fast but upbeat enough to enjoy. This cd is great for listening and surely would appeal to the most diverse salsa tastes. A recommended cd if you are a Miles Pena aficionado.
