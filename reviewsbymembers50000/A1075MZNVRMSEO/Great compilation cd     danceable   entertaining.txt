 I must give credit where credit is due. J & N records are the masters of compilation music in the three most common tropical music categories: salsa, merengue and bachata. I own many compilation cds from this record label and they consistently produce compilation cds that display the best of the best in the category of music being offered. Salsa Hits 2002 is no exception. I bought the cd last week with hopes of enjoying at least half the songs however, it turned out to be complete enjoyment. I listened to the cd in completion without interruption because every song enhanced the cd in some way and was quite danceable. There is a variety of salsas offered in this one. Some are romantic salsas such as: "Quiero" by Jerry Rivera and Rey Ruiz's "No". Others are more commercial and danceable like "Comerte a besos" by Frankie Negron and "Amor asi" by Tito Nieves. There's a classic old style salsa which is totally a treat and a well known song "Cuero Na'ma" and one more in the category of a ballad is "Yo si me enamore" by Huey Dunbar. You can't go wrong with this cd. It will meet the needs of the most diverse salsa tastes. Be it fast, romantic, traditional or classic whatever you prefer there's a song or there are songs for you in this wonderful compilation cd. High recommendation given. This is another great one by J & N records. Other great compilations by this record label: Bachata hits 2001 & 2002, Merenhits 2000, 2001 & 2002. Do enjoy!
