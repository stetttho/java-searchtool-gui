 I liked this album by Antony Santos the first time I listened to it and with no doubt I labelled this one as his most mellow production. First of all I like the fact that all the merengues are at the end, which gives the listener the option to listen to them, or not. The bachatas have good lyrics, good rhythms and are sentimental but none of them are showstoppers. This is very uncharacteristic of Antony Santos because all his albums usually have a "hit song". My personal favourites on this one are: Te di mi amor and Ya no me quieres querer (I think this is one of the most sentimental bachatas that he has ever produced). Song # 6 is a balad and the last four are merengues. This is a good album, depending upon what you are looking for but definitely not one of his best.
