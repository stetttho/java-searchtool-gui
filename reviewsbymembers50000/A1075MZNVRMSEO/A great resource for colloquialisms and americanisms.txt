 I purchased this dictionary at a Spanish book festival three years ago and it has been a useful reference material thus far. The dictionary is geared towards speakers and learners of Latin American Spanish just judging by the vocabulary throughout the dictionary. It includes plenty of colloquialisms as well.  The dictionary is arranged alphabetically in Spanish with the equivalent English word or phrase. This dictionary can help clarify many inquiries you may have about the terminology, words, phrases, anglicisms that are so diverse in Latin America and even in the USA. It contains approximately 5000 entries and here are some examples: 1)	chotear= mofarse de alguien. =to make fun of somebody 2)	chamuchina= populacho=riffraff 3)	palanganear= fanfaronear=to brag, show off 4)	pinche= maldito=lousy 5)	cucar=molestar=to provoke These are just some of the many examples of the type of vocabulary that is included in this dictionary. Of course this is selective vocabulary, which one may deem not important to know but it won't hurt to understand what these words means since they are part of the colloquial Spanish spoken by many.
