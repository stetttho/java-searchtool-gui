 I must admit this album took me by surprise because I was expecting something comparable to "Mi Tierra" which by far is one of the best tropical albums of all time. I think the title of this album is where the deception lies. "Alma caribea" leads one to believe that the album is soulful, upbeat and possibly danceable. However, the album cannot be described as such. It is rather mellow, nostalgic and  slow paced with a few tropical songs which definitely uplift the production. I found it hard to rate this album at first because I did not want my perception of what I expected to hear influence my assessment of what the album really has to offer.  No question about it's definitely a tropical album but contains mostly boleros with four songs that can fit into the category of salsa more or less or "tropical music". The musical arrangements are creative and the cuban influence and elements can be heard. In a nutshell expect a a very mellow slow-paced album with balads/boleros in a tropical rhythm. This album is good for easy listening and background music. Instead of "Alma caribea" maybe it should be called "Alma diferente". Overall it's a solid production.
