 This book is from the collection of four such books by the author Pedro Juan Gutierrez in which he reveals the sordid details about Cuba that still are unknown to many around the world. The life of Pedro Juan G in Cuba in the 90's was full of repression, day-to-day struggles, strife and female encounters. This book -El insaciable hombre arana- is just a series of episodes chapter by chapter each not necessarily relating to each other but reveal episodes of his life as he struggled to survive in Cuba post the decline of the Soviet Union. There is no real plot. Reading the book was once again very enlightening however, I did not find this book as illustrative as the other two that I read which are: Trilogia sucia de la Habana and El rey de la Habana. Perhaps it could be that by this being the third on this subject matter it was no longer an invigorating experience. Nevertheless, I appreciate the details and the opportunity to see this side of Cuba through the experiences of the author. It's worth the read if you are curious. I give the book a rating of 3.5 stars.
