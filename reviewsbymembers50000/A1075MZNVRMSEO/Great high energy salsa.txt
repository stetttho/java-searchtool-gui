 When it comes to producing great albums the sky is the limit for Fruko y sus Tesos. This group is truly incredible when it comes to producing hot Colombian salsa. This album certainly is exemplary but then again I expected nothing but sheer excellence. The only other group on market today that can compete with their style salsa is Sonora Carruseles and both groups in fact have dominated "boogaloo salsa" which has been the new genre that has dominated their repertoire over the past five years. I love the energy that this album creates. The rhythms, the musicality, the instrumentation are all top notch. The stop button does not exist when you play this album. It's great from start to finish. It is truly a salsa lover's delight. Two songs really caught my attention- #1- Pura candela and #9- Pa' goza con Fruko. Song #10 is a beautiful bolero that is well sung and has great lyrics. If you are a fan of Fruko or salsa music purchase this album, it will be money well spent. Enjoy Fruko's boogaloo!/// I just wanted to add that I listened to this album again today for the second time and just for the record every song is awesome. Besides the above mentioned ones watch out salseros for # 4 Salsa mayor  and # 6 Ave Maria, que rumbon. This is just a terrific cd.  Lelsey D, 10/19/2003.
