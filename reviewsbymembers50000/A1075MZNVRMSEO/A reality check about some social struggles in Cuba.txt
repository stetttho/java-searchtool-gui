 This book is about the reality of the life of Cubans today, a country that imposes unconceivable laws on it's own people and as a result have lost hope to keep on living in their native country. "Regreso a la Habana" is a real life portrait of the life of an adolescent, a woman and a prostitute who meets three different Spanish men. They fall in love, commit to the relationship however, in a false sense because none of them marry her (Tatiana) nor take her out of Cuba, which is her dream, to get of the misery in which she lives.  Although each man is different, each means the same to Tatiana the protagonist. In other words, "an opportunity" and "a possible dream about to come true". However, Tatiana has the same luck that most Cubans share who have risked their life in search of a better one. The book is very enlightening, well written and paints a real picture of Cuba which has two faces- one for tourists (foreigners) and another for the Cuban people. I recommend this book to those who like to read a variety of different types of literature.
