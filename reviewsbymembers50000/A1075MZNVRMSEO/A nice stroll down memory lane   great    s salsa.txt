 This was one of my first set of salsa cds when I began collecting salsa music in 1993 and this one will forever remind me of the best of salsa romantica at the time. Looking back these artists have either stopped singing, changed their style, merged with other groups or simply disappeared. However, thanks to this recording their music lives on. There are not too many salsa compilations that can dazzle you like this one. Salsa en grande vol. 3 will have you doing a bit of everything ie. singing, dancing, laughing and just remembering the good old days. This salsa is from the era when salsa was still pure and the lyrics were still romantic. You can listen to this cd from start to finish without a doubt. The challenge is how many times you will hit "repeat". All the songs are great and dance worthy if you like to dance salsa but my favorites on this cd are: Cuenta conmigo (remix), Estas tocando fuego, Idilio & Quitate la mascara. If you buy it you will enjoy it for sure.
