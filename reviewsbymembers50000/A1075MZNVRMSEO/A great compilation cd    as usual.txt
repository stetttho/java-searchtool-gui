 It seems like every year I end up saying the same thing about this compilation series. That's because every year J & N Records keeps compiling the top bachata hits from the current year all on one cd. This one is no exception to Bachatahits 2001,2002 & 2003. In a nutshell if you have been following bachata music over the past year and a half you will definitely recognize and appreciate many of selections on this album. There are popular hits from: Frank Reyes, Joe Veras, Monchy & Alexandra just to name a few of the artists. Also included are songs from artists who you may not be familiar with like Christian Christian who had disappeared from the bachata scene for a few years. If you are a fan of bachata and are looking for compilation of songs that will give you a non-stop listening experience, Bachatahits 2004 is a must have. Buy it. You will enjoy it. This is a guarantee.
