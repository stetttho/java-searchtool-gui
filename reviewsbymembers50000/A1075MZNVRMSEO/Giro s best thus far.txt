 Giro is not a very renowned salsero and his name certainly does not come up among the greats however, this cd might be the twist of fate that would give him the popularity and recognition that any artist would love to have in his/her favor. I have tried all Giro's album and this one really is the one that shows his experience and perseverance. It's pure salsa with great acoustics, his voice was always good and in this album he brought all together. Highly recommended if you are looking for pure, traditional PR style salsa.
