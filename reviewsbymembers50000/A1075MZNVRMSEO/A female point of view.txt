 Nothing but curiosity led me to this book. I stumbled upon it in a bookstore and decided to purchase it since it is an out of print book therefore hard to ascertain. I read it and I found it very informative and would recommend it to males and couples since part of the solution requires a collaborative effort. It's easy to read and correct terms are used throughout the book. It's worth the try if you wish to overcome this sexual dysfunction (if this is the problem you are having).
