 First of all this was the first novel I have read by Ernesto Sabato and it has left me with a great impression of his writing style. It is very intriguing from the get go as one learns the outcome of the novel first and then the story develops afterwards. The protagonist Juan is a reclusive painter striving for acknowledgement. Maria becomes an obsession since she is the only one who can understand his work. His passion, obsession and desesperation leads him to kill Maria and gives the readers insight to his "tunel" (his torchered inner soul).   The only other novel that I read along these lines in terms of uniqueness of plot and intrigue was L'entranger by Albert Camus. Definitely they are both one of kind novels. A recommended read.
