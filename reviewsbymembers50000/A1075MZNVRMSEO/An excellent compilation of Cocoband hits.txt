 Cocoband, one of the more successful merengue bands from the Dominican Republic (although not as dominant today) has produced wonderful music of all genres and this cd is no exception although it is a greatest hits cd. This cd brings together some of Cocoband's greatest of salsa, merengue and cha cha cha. This is definitely a collector's cd and dancer's treasure from start to finish. The cd opens with their renowned salsa tune "Salsa con Coco" and continues with some equally popular songs such as "La compota", El Toro en la Capital" and "A usted lo Botan". This album is definitely a worthwhile purchase as it offers the best of tropical music by strong merengue band.
