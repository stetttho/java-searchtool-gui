 This is a valuable resource for those who are pursuing specialized studies in Spanish such as translation and linguistics. The book will also be helpful to advanced students, teachers and native speakers who have an interest in the specifics of the language such as the art to vocabulary building. The book focuses on Spanish suffixes and the possible equivalents in the English language where applicable. This book will help you to grow your vocabulary, better understand the roots of Spanish words and also help you to strengthen your foundation in understanding the logical aspect in the formation of words in Spanish. For example: Words that end in -ity- in English usually end in -dad- Spanish. Humanity=humanidad and eternity =eternidad and the gender is feminine.  -ence- and -ency- in English is equivalent to -encia- in Spanish. Agency= agencia and Afluency=afluencia.  Also at the end of every suffix studied there are samples of idiomatic expressions at random that are very helpful which will also increase your vocabulary and knowledge of fixed expressions in Spanish. Examples from the book include: 1) a suplicacion- on petition or by request 2) andar en lenguas- to be the subject of gossip 3) hora punta- rush hour 4) noticia bomba- sensational news 5) huelga decir-needless to say. I have not seen anything comparable to this guide on the market. I have owned for seven years now and it has been an educational and priceless resource.
