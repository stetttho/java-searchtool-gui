 For a compilation cd, I must say it is wonderful. This is the first of this series by J & N records (the originators of the Merenhits series) and they definitely have showcased the best of the best. I was particularly impressed with the sequence of top bachatas one after the other which would make for great listening in any type of setting. The only surprise is that some of the bachatas are from '98 and for a newly launched series it may have been more attractive to have the newest and latest bachatas but other than that this cd is a winner. I highly recommend this purchase.
