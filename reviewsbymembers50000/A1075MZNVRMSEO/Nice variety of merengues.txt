 What I like most about this compilation cd is the variety of merengues styles. Since tastes vary, one genre of merengue by various artists would not offer much diversity but the songs on this compilation were well selected which makes for great listening in any atmosphere ie. party, relaxing, background music just to name a few possible scenarios. Popular artists make up this compilation cd such as: Tono R and Los Hnos R offer a blend of contemporary and classic merengue. Banda Chula and Oro Solido are typical fast merengues bands. Olga Tanon is for those who like merengue suave (her style of course). Banda Gorda has become a favorite over the years and their music is usually appealing. In short you can't go wrong with that band. Overall this is a great cd to sample various merengue artists and for hearty listening.
