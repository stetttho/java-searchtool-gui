 Fruko y sus Tesos is one of the few exemplary groups who have mastered the genre of salsa known as "salsa brava". This is their second consecutive album after a long hiatus from the music world and they have once again proven that they have not lost their ability nor creativity and a strong sounding percussion and drums is still their claim to fame. This album called "Power Salsa" and rightfully so is a work of art in terms of combining well mastered beats and rhythms. Although very contemporary sounding and fast paced, Fruko has preserved many traditional elements of salsa which can be heard throughout the album. Traditionally a hard sounding salsa group, Fruko did not stray away from this style but added key elements such as "swing" and "charanga" to many of the songs thus enhancing and all already fast paced tempo. The album is a dancer's bliss and any song in the album will inspire salsa lovers to flock to the floor and groove like never before. There are some songs in this album that are in a class by themselves such as "Cachondea", "Cali de Rumba","Se me olvido otra vez", "El Swing de Fruko", "Nac en la Barriada"and "El Preso" (new version ) but as mentioned before all are worthy of praise. I highly recommend this salsa cd because of its artistic creativity and cadence by some of the finest singers that Colombia has to offer. Qu... viva... la ...salsa!
