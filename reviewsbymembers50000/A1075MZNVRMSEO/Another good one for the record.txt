 This album by La Sonora Carruseles (2004) is no different from the rest. It is awesome and this salsa is becoming incomparable if it has not yet stepped into that exclusive class already. This album has all the earmarks of Carruseles style salsa: fast paced rhythms, the "boogaloo" element, great percussion, tremendous lyrics, cumbia and it is extremely danceable. Not too many salsa groups today have this ability to keep producing top notch albums. If you have become a Sonora Carruseles fan since 1998 when they released Heavy Salsa and all the others to follow then this album is definitely for you.
