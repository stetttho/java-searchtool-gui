 This cd is for Joe Arroyo fans and admirers of Colombian salsa delivered by one of its finest. Echao pa'lante is one of Joe's older productions but definitely is still a cd that can ignite any party with its fine line up of songs. No need to list them all here but it contains some of his classics such as: Rebelion, Echao pa'lante, Mary, Musa original and many hits from that era in Joe's career. It's never too late and you will never grow weary of this fine music by Joe Arroyo y la verdad. This is a great cd with a variety of tropical rhythms: Joeson, cumbia and salsa.
