 I purchased this album almost three years ago and never really paid attention to it. I liked it when I first listened to it but somehow I never focused on it after that. I listened to this album yesterday and I must pay tribute to it. Bachata just does not come like this anymore. He does have a unique voice, which I would say is his trademark and Luis Segura is just incredibly sentimental. This is one of kind bachata for its lyrics, rhythms, fusion of rhythms and its unique style. I cannot think of any other bachata artist who can compare to Luis Segura. This album in my opinion is one of his best along with Como Yo. It has a tremendous line up of sentimental bachatas but I confess the ones that caught my attention are: Me la pagaras, Bajate de esa nube, Porque morire, Dos mujeres (increible), and Cosas de la vida. If you are a fan of a slower pace, more traditional style bachata you may want to sample Luis Segura's music from this album or any of his previous ones.
