 I almost forgot to review this album. I have been playing it continuously since I purchased it 2 weeks ago. All I can say is that this a wonderful compilation cd. If you have heard or collect bachata from either of the two you may be familiar with some or all of the songs. This is really a fine compilation in which all the songs are good. It was truly a great selection  by UNIVISION records. The selected songs from Antony Santos tend to be older than the bachatas from Luis Varags but they flow well together. It is great for listening and dancing is always a possibility if you like this kind of bachata. Also all the songs are original.  This is basically a fun album. I especially like songs 1-7 and Voy pa'lla. Wow.. this is bachata in another dimension.
