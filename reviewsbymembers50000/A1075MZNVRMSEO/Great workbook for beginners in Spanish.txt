 "Spanish the Easy Way" is an excellent workbook for those who are truly beginners or those who are restarting again in the Spanish language. I used this book when I was teaching elementary school Spanish, grades 1-5 to Hispanic and non-hispanic children and the short stories, practice exercises, crossword puzzles and additional vocabulary really enhanced the students comprehension of the language without overburdening them with grammar and other language technicalities that are more suitable for advanced learners. You will gain a good base in Spanish and have some competent communications skills if you study the book sequentially without jumping ahead because the verbs are taught in a logical pattern which is the most important concept to grasp when learning any language not only Spanish. The book covers the present tense and the simple past tense of "ar", "er", "ir" and irregular verbs that must be learnt immediately to be able to converse even at the most basic level. The rest of the book covers grammar topics appropriate for beginners along with the formation of short but correct grammatical phrases. Another bonus is that an answer key is provided at the back of the book which will enable to check your answers as you progress through the lessons. The two downfalls of this workbook include: 1)  it does not include cassette tapes and if you are a beginner and embarking upon self taught study correct pronunciation and phonetics will be challenge so it would be best use this book as a complement to classroom instruction 2) it could have been organized more logically because the current format is not easy for a beginner to follow. However, this is truly a good starter workbook in Spanish. Just be patient with yourself since language learning is a challenge and most of all enjoy the lessons and the short stories as they are quite entertaining. All the best!
