 This is a small reference dictionary arranged alphabetically, that references customary problematic concepts in Spanish with a clear explanation why a verb, noun, preposition etc. can or cannot be used in a certain way and gives examples of the common errors made by native and non-native speakers. I found it to be quite helpful since regular dictionaries give the meaning of the words and possibly an example of its usage in a sentence but does not explain the logic behind errors made when using a particular word or phrase etc. The dictionary falls under the category of "autoaprendizaje" which means self-study because the kind of queries that the book covers would interests native or near native speakers. This is an excellent reference dictionary for teachers, professionals and advance Spanish speakers. I only wish it were a little bigger!
