 This is a high energy cd full of upbeat, fast tempo and rhythmic merengues. For those of you who are already familiar with Nelson de la Olla's style the only surprise here is that this cd is even better than the previous three. For those who are experimenting with this style known as merengue-mambo for the first time- "bienvenidos". This cd is primarily for dancers due to the fast-pace beat but can be enjoyed by those who prefer to listen to music because the lyrics are quite entertaining. Nelson de la Olla transforms life themes and everyday happenings into music that everyone can laugh about and enjoy in any social or party atmosphere. The recording sound is also of top quality and each song has a different musical component that contributes to the overall success of the album. All the songs are great and the ones that really catch my attention are: "Si tu boquita", "El pichirr?", and "El hijo de machepa". Como dice el t?tulo este disco es pa'sofoca, qu? chuler?a.
