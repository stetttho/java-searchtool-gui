 This album by Willy Castro, his forth as a bachata artist is by far one of his best. His debut album was sensational and since then he has always maintained the credibility that he rightfully deserves. This album is has a fine line up of romantic tunes but with great rhythms. Although the album falls under the category of romantic bachata the songs are not as slow as others that fall under said classification. I would recommend this album to those who like to listen to bachata (the lyrics are great) more so than dance bachata. The whole album can be played non-stop, which is typical of all Willy Castro's music. This is a worthy purchase with great music from a young artist with a future.
