 This perhaps is one of Fernando's most sentimental albums of his repertoire because it's full of songs and lyrics that will go straight to your heart and soul. Fernando, a sentimental person by nature brings out the beauty of each song with his silk voice. The album has ten songs among them a very special ballad "Soy culpable". What he's guilty of only the lyrics will tell you but you will perceive Fernando's sadness just by the way he sings the song. The merengues are typical of el Mayimbe. They are smooth and rhythmic with nuances and arrangements that give them a very Caribbean sound. I reiterate this album is wonderful and worthy of your patronage. Other recommendations: El Mayimbe en Bachata and Mal acostumbrado if you don't yet own these other great recordings.
