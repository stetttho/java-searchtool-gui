 I think "Tropical" is a wonderful cd and this merengue can be enjoyed. It definitely does not compare to other albums in their repertoire such as " Los mundialmente sabrosos" from 1993 or "Los Due�os del Swing" their album from 1995 however; it's still a reflection of their capacity to produce "good" merengue. Not all the songs are going to catch your attention, but there are few that are "hits" such as: Fin de semana, Y es f�cil, Rompecintura and D�gale que no. If you are a fan of Los Hermanos Rosario and you wish to continue collecting their music, this cd is a worthwhile purchase. In spite of the views of the other reviewers on this product page, I think the cd does merit some recognition. You'll enjoy it, I'm sure of that.
