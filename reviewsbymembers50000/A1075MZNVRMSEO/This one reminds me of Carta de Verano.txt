 Joe Veras' latest release (Carta de verano 2003) has inspired me to go back and listen to all his albums that I own and this one really reminds me of Carta de verano which is a tremendous production. Joe Veras, a pillar bachatero in the Dominican Republic really exemplifies the beauty and magical mystique of bachata through his music. As usual the lyrics are moving and he scores again with his hypnotic rhythms. The merengues on this cd are great too especially track #4. I can't stress this enough, Joe Veras is an incredible bachata artist who is leaving quite legacy for himself. I just hope there are as many other avid followers of his music who share my point of view. All the bachatas on this cd are terrific. The ones that became popular are:  El molde, Asi es la vida, Corazon callado & El amor es ciego. Go for it, you deserve it, buy the album, you will see what I mean.
