 This is a wonderful cumbia compilation cd with a mix of the old with the new. Good cumbia and good cumbia compilations are a rare find so if you are truly a fan of this genre of music no doubt you will appreciate this cd. Most of the songs are by the original artists and the renditions that are not are quite well sung and do not take much away from the original. This cumbia is as authentic as it gets even the newer songs. What attracted me to the cd was the fact it has songs from El Combo de las Estrellas, a great Cumbia band from Colombia. I decided to purchase the cd and it turned out to be a very worthy purchase. It can be listened to without interruptions. Give this one a try if you are looking for some genuine Colombian cumbia.
