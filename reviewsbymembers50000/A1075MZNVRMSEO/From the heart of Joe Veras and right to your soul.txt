 After a relatively quiet period Joe Veras is slowly and surely making is way back up to the top. This album is just full of heart-warming bachatas with penetrating lyrics. The tone of the cd is very romantic and the rhythms and lyrics exemplify its romantic air. Some songs will immediately catch your attention. Listen carefully to Por tu amor, Antidoto and Viejo amigo. Overall all the bachatas are good. Some definitely are more danceable than others. The merengues too will please you especially if you like merenbachata. In a few words this is a great album by Mr. Joe Veras...llego, llego sin duda.
