 If you are looking for a book that will explain details as they relate to sexual matters, STDs, sexual issues faced by couples or on a personal level etc. this book provides great informative details with viable suggestions for solutions to the problems one may face. Proper terminology is used at all times and there is a wealth of information about the most common male and female sexual disfunctions, myths of human sexuality and a common problem today; STDs and how to protect oneself. This book is in Spanish and I recommend it for informative or self-help reading.
