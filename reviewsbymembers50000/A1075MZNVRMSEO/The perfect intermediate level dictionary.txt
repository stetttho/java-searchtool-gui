 This dictionary is perfect for an intermediate level Spanish student who wishes to have a unilingual resource without lengthy and complicated definitions. It is an adequate size dictionary with about 30.000 entries and a grammatical appendix. It does contain quite a diverse vocabulary with common idiomatic expressions associated with some of the words. It does also indicate where applicable if the word is familiar (colloquial), considered vulgar or regional (specific to one or more Spanish countries). I use it quite regularly for everyday word clarification and the words are normally referenced. Since I am doing a specialization in Spanish it's not a primary reference for me but as mentioned above the dictionary is a perfect daily desktop dictionary and great for a student who needs a small to midsize reliable unilingual resource.
