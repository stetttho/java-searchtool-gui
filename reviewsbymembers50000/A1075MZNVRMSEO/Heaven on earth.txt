 What a class artist Charlie Zaa is and this album Puro Sentimiento will definitely win the hearts of sentimental bolero fans. This is only the second album I own by this artist and again Charlie Zaa has out done himself with his unique music style which inludes the melodic sound of the requintos and the guitar. The lyrics, acoustics an melody are supreme on this album. No skipping tracks on this one.
