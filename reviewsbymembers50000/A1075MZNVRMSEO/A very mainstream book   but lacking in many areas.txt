 I purchased this book because it was on the top ten most read books in Miami in the month of May and I thought it would be fun to read something light thematically speaking. No politics or historical details nothing of that nature but it was a struggle to get through this book without being tempted to stop reading it completely. The plot was very predictable and the development was too slow.  This book, I suppose is an attempt to give readers a glimpse of modern day Cuban-american culture. Margarita the protagonist of the book is a prominent lawyer as well as her husband Ariel. They have a son who is well-cared for by the in house maid and most of Margarita's day is spent with her two closest friends Vivian and Anabel doing anything and everything around Miami. Maragrita gets a suprise call from a former love interest Luthor and all hell breaks loose when she starts to see him secretly during her lunch hours at his apartment nearby work. As the story progresses, she becomes pregnant and doom lingers as to whether her husband or her lover is the father. However, we learn that the preganancy is a conspiracy between her very "Cuban" mother, her husband and the local pharmacist. I believe the intent of the author was to make this an exciting read as the book is very contemporary with the setting in Miami. However, I just found it unchallenging, predictable and just boring. The last fifty pages of the book was interesting otherwise this was a boring read. I would say it is the reader's choice but if you have other books on your list to read, read them.
