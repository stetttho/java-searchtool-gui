 Surprisingly this is a very informative book. What I mean by surprising is that usually books of this nature tend to be so hypothetical and far-fetched that one ends up not believing anything in it or only reading a few pages and chapters and then abandons the book. This guia sexual touches on most common issues as they relate to el hecho sexual and are well explained. I highly recommend it if you want informative detail, suggestions and problem resolution on a personal level or in an intimate relationship. The book is simple, factual and divided in easy to read chapters. It's suitable for both a male and female audience in a mature relationship.
