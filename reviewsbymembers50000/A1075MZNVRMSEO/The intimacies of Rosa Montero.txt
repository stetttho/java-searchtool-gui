 La Loca de la casa is Rosa Montero's most intimate novel about herself. We learn about the personal fantasies and details about the author through the many  episodes that she experienced while writing many of her works. The book is an autobiography and partial biography about other authors that Rosa Montero talks about continuously throughout the book. Each chapter details a specific episode in Rosa's life that in some circumstances led her to put pen to paper. The episodes are told with enthusiasm and incomparable spirit as the author looks back at her life and her life as a writer. Once you begin to read the book you will quickly identify that La loca de la casa is Rosa Montero herself. I enjoyed the book immensely. It is a great journey through the soul of a terrific author.
