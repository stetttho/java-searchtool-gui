 This has to be one of the most powerful R & B albums that I own and the ironic part is I discovered it by chance in 1992. I did not know anything about KW but I kept hearing his name on the radio so I decided to seek out this debut album. This man has it all; a tremendous voice that is complemented by sensual lyrics. This album transcends time because it's still strong after so many years. If you are a romantic soul or a sentimental person this is the kind of R & B that's a must have. They don't come like this anymore. This is R & B back in the day when it had its peak in popularity. This cd is the ultimate in romantic music. Song # 2, #4, #7, #9 & #10 really bring it home. Strong recommendation given.
