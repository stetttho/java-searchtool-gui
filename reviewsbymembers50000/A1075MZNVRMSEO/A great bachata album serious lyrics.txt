 This bachata is excellent and it's unfortunate that he does not share the heightened popularity of other bachata singers and groups that we hear about now that this genre of music has gained recognition and respect outside of the Dominican Republic. I don't quite remember how I discovered his music but when I saw this album two years ago, I purchased it without thinking twice. This bachata is very traditional, true "bachata del pueblo" with excellent rhythm, authentic instruments and a very clear voice by the lead singer Jhony Rijo. The theme of songs is about women and broken romances sung from the heart with true sentiment. I especially like song #2 Mujeres calla' and #9 Dejaria de vivir. This is the kind of bachata that will never tire you because it's authentic, romantic, and not fly by night. I seriously recommend this one if you like classic bachata. "Una noche me invitaste a tu habitacion....ese dia me di cuenta que me estabas enganando". This is serious.
