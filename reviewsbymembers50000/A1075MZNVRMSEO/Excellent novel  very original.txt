 "Ensayo sobre la ceguera" captivated me as soon as I started to read the book two years ago. Jose Saramago is a renowned novelist and has many novels that can easily fall under the category of magisterial literary works. In this book, he immediately engages the reader in it as the theme of becoming suddenly blind reveals itself in a mysterious way. Various people in a town become blind for no apparent reason except the wife of the principal character in the book- the doctor. Out from this sudden loss of sight we see how the characters become desperate, helpless and frustrated and to a certain extent rely on their other senses to just to carry out their basic daily routines. We also see how people's natural negative aspects become evident when those who became blind are forced to live in isolation together in order to prevent an epidemic of grand proportions. The book is full of intrigue and mystery as we see how the characters struggle with their loss of sight. This book was great to read. It's intriguing and keeps the reader in suspense. I recommend this novel if you are a fan of good modern contemporary literature. Also I recommend reading the Spanish version as opposed to the translation.
