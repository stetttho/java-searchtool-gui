 This book is very detailed, thorough and the subject matter at hand is dealt with professionally and with obvious evidence of expertise. Solo para mujeres can help women of all ages deal with issues as they relate to female sexuality and discover solutions to problems that may have plagued women for years. This book is written by two female doctors who address problems, symptoms and solutions accurately and are well explained with proper terminology used at all times. I purchased the book out of sheer interest because I think it is important for a woman to understand, identify and be comfortable with her own sexuality. Reading it once however is not enough.  Once read it can be used as a reference and a first step guide to determining whether the problem needs professional attention. This is a highly  recommended reference for females and for males who are in a relationship with a woman who may be dealing with some of the issues discussed.
