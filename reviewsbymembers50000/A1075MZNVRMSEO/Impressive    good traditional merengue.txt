 Alex Bueno is definitely one of the most versatile singers of tropical music no doubt about it. We have seen his solid talent in the following musical categories: merengue, bachata, bolero and balada but this cd has to be categorized as his best ever. In this album he has revived what is called "msica criolla" and has reminded us of the nuances, rhythms and beats that are unique to dominican style merengue. Each song exemplifies its essence and the soulfulness that always is typical of this kind of merengue. This showcase of music which is definitely in a class by itself can be enjoyed by anyone who is a fan of tropical rhythms with lively beats and unique instrumentation. Alex's voice is outstanding and like most of his productions the cd can be played from beginning to end. Every song is worthy of recognition. If you are a fan of Alex Bueno, don't miss out on this one. This album is a treasure. Strong recommendation given.
