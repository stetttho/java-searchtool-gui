 "Bachata a su tiempo" is Alex Bueno's bachata debut and what a powerful display of talent it is by one of the most versatile tropical music artists of today. This album has eleven well sung rhythmical bachatas that can captivate any listener who is fond of this genre of music that is spreading rapidly outside of the DR and gaining fans all over the world. Alex, a very sentimental singer gave these bachatas an element that sets this bachata apart from the styles sung by other artists. Although soft and delicate in nature this bachata is extremely danceable with a very dominate sound of the guitar. There are many hits in this album and surely enough when you listen to it you will have your own favourites but I will gladly share my mine with you. They are: "Ese hombre soy yo", "Si vinieras hoy", "Gotas de pena", "Un poco de ti" and " Lo que siento por ti". I reiterate this a tremendous album that will gain the recognition of many loyal and new fans of bachata music.
