 One might ask, "who are these guys" which was my wonder when I first heard their music. I discovered Grupo Mateo's while listening to a compilation cd and I was immediately impressed with their sound and rhythm. This group has mastered the true merengue beat which is normally hard hitting combined with the traditional caribbean nuance. This is their second album and it is quite convincing. Grupo Mateo's has showcased their talent and ability to produce upbeat, high energy, night club style merengue. Every song on this album is danceable and the pace is perfect, not too fast but high energy enough that even the least likely would be on floor regardless of their merengue dancing capabilites. You can sample their music from the compilation cd titled "Merengon 4" or just buy the album and you'll understand what I mean-Grupo Mateo's is a promising upcoming merengue band. Strong recommendation given for this cd- Mateos 2000 or their previous album.
