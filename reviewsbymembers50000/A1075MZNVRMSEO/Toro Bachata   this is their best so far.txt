 This is a typical Toros Band cd but the only difference is they switched musical genres. They tried their hand at a complete bachata cd and it's wonderful. All the songs should catch your attention. In short the lyrics are sentimental, rhythms are catchy, not too fast nor slow, Hector Acosta voice is strong and the bachatas have all the classic earmarks of Los Toros Band music- "bachateame" etc. My favorites are: Morenita and Olvidarme de ella. These songs were the popular ones on the market as well. This is a sincerely recommended cd by a truly successful Dominican group. Bravo los Toros Band!
