 I was very surprised when I listened to this album. I did not expect it to be so full of energy and charisma. Raul Acosta once again has risen to the occasion and is showing the world that his style of "mambo merengue" is real and here to stay. Honestly, I am not fan of "Oro Solido" and seldomly listen to their music but I will give credit when credit is due. This merengue is up beat, fast paced with crazy lyrics which makes dancing this kind a merengue a lot of fun. Also included is a bachata and a cumbia which are debuts for Oro Solido in each genre respectively and are very well done. This is dancer's album from start to finish. Therefore, if you like fast paced, mambo merengue Oro Solido style you will love this album. Bueno ponte a bailar hasta las quince mama...
