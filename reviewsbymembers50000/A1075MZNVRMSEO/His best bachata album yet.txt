 Finally, El Gringo de la Bachata has a marketable and competitive bachata album. I am not saying that his bachata is not good but I always thought that there was something missing.  This album Cosas del amor is a force a to be reckoned with and I was enticed when I saw the commercials for the album on Univision. The hit release is #9 A esos hombres but you will be impressed with all the bachatas before that. All have great lyrics, typical Gringo style rhythms and they are very danceable, a key factor if you like to dance bachata. El Gringo or Ramon Galvez has finally put together an album that should rank among some the best composers and artists in that category. Although his style is very different, this bachata is wonderful.
