 This cd is a wonderful display of the genre of merengue known as "merengue tipico". Having heard some samples in the past on other compilations particularly the "Aqui esta la Bachata series I was inspired to ascertain a cd or two from Agapito Pascual since he's one of the top merengue tipico artists at the present time. I must admit I was inspired by the comments of the first reviewer and my purchase was a sure fire sale. All the songs encompass very creative acoustics and beats. I think the uniqueness of the sound can be attributed to the principal instrument which is the accordion but Agapito definitely has talent. Merengue t?pico which also is from the Dominican Republic is still unique to dominican artists and is yet to be duplicated by other merengue groups. Agapito's style is traditional, pure and very lively. The cd is great for listening and dancing (if you can move that fast!). If you are eager to try this type of merengue this cd will definitely get you moving. This is a very upbeat and high energy production. Strong recommendation given.
