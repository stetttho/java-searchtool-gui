 This salsa video that features moves by Rogelio Moreno and Josie Neglia displays some unique salsa steps that have been mastered by both with the utmost technique. Of course Rogelio and Josie make the steps look smooth and effortless however don't be fooled this is some great salsa coreographed by two great dancers.  The video is well organized as it is broken down into 4 sections:  footwork, turns, dips & drops, lifts & flips. In each section the moves are first shown without music and then with music thus giving you and idea of how the moves flow together with music once mastered. The explanations by Josie and Rogelio are clear and their movements are well syncronized as they display each step in the routines.  The only downfall in this video is that the steps need to be broken down a bit more. Although geared toward advanced salsa dancers some of the moves require a secondary breakdown analysis. Instead the viewer will have to rewind several times in order to see the steps over again.  Overall the video is an excellent display of very advanced salsa variations and if you do manage to master some of their art work you will be the envy of many in any salsa nightclub around the world. I highly recommend the purchase of this video for advanced salsa dancers.
