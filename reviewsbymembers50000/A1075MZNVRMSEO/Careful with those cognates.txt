 False cognates are words that look the same in English and Spanish but the meaning in each language is completely different. I cannot comment on the usage of false cognates by Spanish speakers learning English but everyday I hear cognates used by English speakers learning Spanish and the intended meaning is completely skewed due to lack of knowing the correct word or assuming that word means the same in both languages. Without consulting the book many come to mind. For example: "Effective" in English is "eficaz" in Spanish and not "efectivo" as I often hear. "Efectivo" in Spanish means "cash". "Sensitive" in Spanish is "sensible" and not "sensato" which ironically means sensible. Those two words always challenge students. A list of words like my examples is detailed in this handy manual. It explains the meaning of the cognate in both languages with examples. If you are conscious about speaking Spanish correctly this reference will help you achieve your goal. It not exhaustive but it certainly should be a part of students library of Spanish references.
