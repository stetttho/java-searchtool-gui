 Tono Rosario is a legendary merengue artist and proves his talent once again with "Resistire". I never doubted if it would be good, I just wondered how much better can an artist be with a career and repertoire like Tono's. This album is a reflection of the Tono of old. It's a classic merengue album rhythm wise and the choice of songs that you prefer is up to you the listener. The first track was what set the stage for me "El Reloj" - a beautiful merengue and just a sign of the caliber of this album. The remake "Sombras nada mas " is impressive and "Te amare" is just outstanding. Tono is back- "llego el cuquito otra vez". Don't miss out on this one.
