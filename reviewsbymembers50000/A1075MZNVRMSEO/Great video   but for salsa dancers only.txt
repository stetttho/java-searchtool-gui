 I bought this video a few days ago and then read the comments on this product page and I was bit hesitant to open the video. However, it is great and in fact one the best that I own from the Josie Neglia series. The salsa moves are excellent, popular, but for advanced salsa dancers only. I found the moves to be great refreshers since I have been taken salsa lessons for almost 10 years now and dance regularly. These moves serve as refreshers for those who are salsa dancers and possibly instructors. If you are a beginner this video is not for you and in fact there's nothing on the box that says "beginner salsa" therefore I am not sure where the notion of this video being for beginners originated. Once again the moves are fantastic, common and will help you to break down the moves more if that's what is needed to perfect them. The downfall of this video to me is the merengue section. The moves are simple; they are shown very quickly and demonstrated all together at the end. I also found that Josie and her partner are not good merengue dancers at all. They are definitely dancing out of time on the moves and I think considering that the salsa section was so advanced and strong they could have done a better display of moves in this section.  The setting and the space for demonstration in this video is excellent. It seems to be an empty nightclub dance floor, which gives them plenty of space to move and be natural. I emphasize this video is a great refresher of advanced salsa moves for those who are at an advanced level and beyond. I do recommend this purchase for "salseros".
