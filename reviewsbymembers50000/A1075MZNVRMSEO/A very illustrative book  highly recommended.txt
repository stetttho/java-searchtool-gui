 I read this book twice thoroughly before writing this review. The book is very complete and discusses the most common myths and realities about "el sexo joven" and many enigmas as well. The book is not only for adolescents, it's definitely beneficial to adults as well who have teenagers or have questions themselves that they would like to have answered without having to go to a gynecologist or urologist depending on the nature of the problem.  The book is divided into the following four chapters: 1) Sentidos y sin sentidos del sexo joven 2) Preocupaciones puntales 3) El sexo mal entendido 4) Cultura sexual de ultima hora Dra. Anbel Ochoa covers all grounds related to the myths of sexuality, cultural taboos and today's societal concerns as they relate to sexuality, sexuality transmitted diseases, contraceptives, pregnancy and the list is endless. Once again the thoroughness is what makes this book so enlightening as it covers many aspects of this diverse and in some cases controversial topic due to cultural differences. It is easy to read and all correct terminology is used which is important especially for adolescents who definitely need to understand the importance of their own sexual development and corporal changes from the beginning. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for clarification and understanding of sexual culture. The editorial review on the product page is also very thorough and gives insight to the topics covered in the book. I read the Spanish version, I am unsure if there is a version in English.
