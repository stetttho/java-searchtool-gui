 I bought this cd a few years ago because I recognized a few of the artists on the cover but I was surprised with myself that I couldn't really recognize the other artists. However, once I heard the music I knew why. The music is "tropical" but I would not say Dominican. I think if you consider the cd from that perspective it's nice. It has a nice mix of tropical sounding music but the bachatas are weak. Good artists- Raulin R & Luis V but the songs could have been something more representative of bachata "del pueblo" which better identifies Dominican culture. I don't know what criteria Putamayo uses when combining these cultural compilations but they have to ensure that the music is a true representation of the people and it's culture. Like I said as a tropical cd (and that's how I rated it) it's okay. As a Dominican cd...it needs to have more authentic merengue & bachata.
