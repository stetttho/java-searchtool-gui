 This  book is a lifesaver if you are looking for a resource that is well organized and thoroughly explains grammar concepts in Spanish appropriate for Intermediate and Advanced level students. In 48 chapters essential grammar concepts are analyzed with practice exercises. There is a strong focus on verbs, their functionality and the different moods and tenses which is essential if mastering the spoken and written language is your goal. Many examples are provided and the practice exercises allow for immediate application of the concepts that are taught in each lesson. The only downfalls of this workbook in my opinion are: 1) it was not always easy to understand the objective of practice exercises which made filling out the blanks or the task a bit challenging 2) there is no answer key and as a student that is a requirement as one does not want to practice making the same errors. However, there may be an answer key as a separate purchase which is usually the case when the answers are not provided at the back of the book. Overall, this is a thorough workbook. I recommend it to Intermediate and Advanced level students.
