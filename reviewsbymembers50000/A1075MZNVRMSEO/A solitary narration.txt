 This is definitely the most unusual book that I have read since I have become an avid reader. There is no plot at all but the book is just a narration of the narrator's obsession for a woman named Aida who he falls in love with but more so in love with her body. The narrator is weakened; saddened, mesmerized by his love for Aida but most of all I would say ironically is an unhappy "solitario" because he does not really share a life with Aida but admires, dreams about her and has a relationship with her from a distance. The beauty about this book is the narrative because the vocabulary and use of metaphors are exquisite but the lack of a plot and true storyline makes this book a potential bore. Once you start read it you may or may not continue. This is not Cristina Peri Rossi's best literature. However, I still appreciate her literary work.
