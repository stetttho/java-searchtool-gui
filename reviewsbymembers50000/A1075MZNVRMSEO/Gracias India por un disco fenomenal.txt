 This album is la India's best thus far in her music career. It has soul, charisma, Latin flavour, passion and most of all "sabor tropical". La India has showcased her multidimensional talent as an artist and singer and has also crossed over into other genres. I did not know what to expect from this album but I anticipated an extraordinary production since I started hearing wonderful comments about "Latin Songbird". I can proudly add to the already great feedback that this album is a potential Grammy award winner for the best salsa and tropical album of the year. I listened to the album through and through in admiration and with pride for a well done production. The genre here is clearly salsa but there are other rhythms such as bolero, balada, merengue and some soul/r&b (# 8 Sedceme). La India's voice in this album is really outstanding and each song is sung with soul & power typical of La India. If you are considering owning this album, you won't regret this purchase. If you have forgotten la India's music remember some great songs like: Vivir lo nuestro, Ese hombre and Nunca voy a olvidarte. This is a tremendous album by a tremendous singer.
