 I stumbled across this textbook in the campus bookstore, glanced at a few of the chapters and immediately decided to purchase it. I have the 3rd edition, which is slightly different from this newer version offered by Amazon however the grammatical exercises are the same. This text covers an abundance of grammatical concepts that will help students who are already bilingual (Eng/Spanish) and wish to clarify and fortify specific queries about Spanish grammar. Each chapter focuses on one Spanish speaking country, provides some key historical facts and questions, one grammatical concept with corresponding exercises, some phonetic and orthographic nuances, idiomatic phrases or expressions and other miscellaneous exercises. The book is a great review for advanced students and a reference for Hispanics who learned Spanish in the home but had no formal training. The only flaw in this text is that it does not have an answer key, which is vital if the student is pursuing independent study. As a former Spanish teacher, I solidly recommend this text to those abovementioned as it offers valuable grammatical clarifications. It's a bit pricey but the good things in life usually are.  I honestly recommend the purchase of this text.
