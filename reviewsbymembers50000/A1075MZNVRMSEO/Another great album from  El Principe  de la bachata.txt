 This is another great production from Frank Reyes who has virtually produced flawless albums since "Vine a decirte adios". He has a very soft voice and a romantic tone which makes for a  powerful combination when it comes to bachata.  Honestly when I  bought the album I did know what to expect. I had only heard the first song "Nada de nada" and I liked it but little did I know that the whole album was going to be so precious and sentimental. As a person he's unique and so is his talent. This album "Dejame entrar " is very complete. It has great musical arrangements, catchy bachata rhythms, a great selection of songs and as usual deep sentimental lyrics.  You can't go wrong this album. It's definitely one of Frank Reyes' best recordings (but that's what I said after every album he produced in the past three years) and definitely is one of the top ten in 2002. I highly recommend this album if you are a fan of romantic bachata. Also I proudly suggest some other great productions thus far this year: "Confesiones" (Monchy & Alexandra), "Derroche de Amor" (Raulin Rodriguez), Camino sin regreso (Junior & Jorge) & "No es casualidad" (Yoskar Sarante).
