 I am with the crowd with regards to this new production by "el Mayimbe". It's different; it's refreshing and just down right a great album! I personally feel he has had some struggles situating himself over the past 3-4 albums among newer upcoming bachata artists who I would not say are better but it just seems like they have dominated the bachata scene over the period of time mentioned. Many questioned whether Antony Santos has what it takes to compete, to continue with a great career that he built for himself. Well, I think this album should clarify any doubts. I like all the bachatas (even "Brindo por tu cumpleanos"-referring to Victor Feliz's comment). I don't tend to like merengue inclusions in any bachata cd but one caught my attention "Yo sin ti". This album emphasizes Antony Santos' strength as a bachata artist because these ones are strong. They have great rhythms, lyrics and are very sentimental. However, they did remind me of the bachatas from his previous album 'El balazo". They have the same nuances. Anyway, if you like Antony Santos and you have followed his career, you may want to listen to this album. It's worth your time and money. I gave it four stars because of the merengues- too many and they are not necessary, otherwise, this is a great production.
