 Phenomenal bachata was my first impression after listening to this cd. Jorge Ferreira is a talented bachatero and year after year he delivers. This album is one of his most romantic productions (not to say that the others are not) but this one some how goes straight to the soul. Jorge has surpassed his own excellence and this cd definitely puts him in a unique class apart from his bachata counterparts. The album is a hit and the first song- "No llores por mi" sets the tone. Watch out this is "bachata sentimental" of high caliber.
