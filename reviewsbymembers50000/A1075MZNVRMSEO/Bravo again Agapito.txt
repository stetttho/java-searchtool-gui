 This new production by Agapito Pascual is truly phenomenal. I started listening to merengue tipico about year ago and I really like the energy that's produced by the principal instrument, the accordion.  If this genre of music is new to you I could assure that Agapito Pascual is one of the best in the business. I became interested in his music thanks to the Aqui esta la bachata compilation series that have some merengue tracks by the artist on various volumes. In a nutshell, this album is superb. Put on your dancing shoes because this merengue will just move you in all directions. All of the songs are great and the rhythms are very upbeat. I extremely enjoy track #4- Me esta enganando and # 6 Por ser egoista. His style is one of kind. Do enjoy!
