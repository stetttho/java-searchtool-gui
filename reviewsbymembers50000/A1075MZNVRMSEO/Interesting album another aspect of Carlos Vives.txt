 Admittedly if I had reviewed this album a year ago when I first purchased it, it would not have scored so high in the ranking because I was not attracted to this music at all and as a result I neglected to listen to the album for a year. I recently played it again to see if my opinion had changed and believe me my reception was completely different. This is a great album and although it has typical Carlos Vives nuances the rhythms are very Caribbean and that of Carlos'modern vallenato. I would say this album is a mellower version of his previous production "El amor de mi tierra" which I think is a tremendous one no doubt. This one offers a variety of musical rhythms and I don't know how he managed it but the influence of many genres of music can be heard throughout the album, Afro beats, rock, son, cumbia all have been well blended into Carlos' unique modern vallenato style. In a nutshell, if you have some previous music from Carlos Vives and if you like afro-Caribbean rhythms this production will catch your attention. It's definitely for listeners and dancers of vallenato and for those who can appreciate his unique style. I am glad I gave this album a second chance.
