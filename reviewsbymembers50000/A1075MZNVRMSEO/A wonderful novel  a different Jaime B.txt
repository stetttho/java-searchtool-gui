 Y de repente un angel can possibly be the long awaited novel by Jaime Bayly that is a reflection of his true writing ability. In this novel Jaime B stays clear of his regular themes- homosexuality and bisexuality and relates a wonderful story of a writer who hires a maid who is an illiterate woman in her fifties. Julio Beltran, the protagonist is intrigued by her past and decides to help Mercedes find her mother who sold her when she was young girl. Intertwined in this main story, we get a sense of the class structure in Peru, social issues and Julio's personal strife which is a possible reflection of Jaime Bayly's plight with his own family.   Y de repente an angel, is well written, intriguing and captivating. I recommend this novel to those who enjoy Jaime Bayly's writing style or to anyone who is looking for a novel with an interesting plot.
