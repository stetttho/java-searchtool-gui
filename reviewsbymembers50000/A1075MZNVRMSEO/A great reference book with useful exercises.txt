 This workbook masters two important grammatical concepts that present difficulty for Spanish students. Thanks to the clarity and thoroughness of the text-workbook, students and those looking to perfectionize specific weaknesses in their understanding of pronouns and prepositions will immediately recognize that this book is an excellent resource. It is well organized, first tackling pronouns of all categories then prepositions with a strong emphasis on "por" and "para". Each chapter offers a clear explanation of the topic at hand, followed by a wide variety of examples of its usage, ample practice exercises and a practical translation at the end of every chapter. Once having completed the exercises, there is an answer key at the back of the book which is extremely beneficial in that the student can readily identify his/her strengths and weaknesses. As a Spanish teacher, I found this text and the exercises to be a useful supplemenatary study aid that enables Spanish students at all levels to fortify their knowledge and understanding of the grammatical topics covered in the book. This workbook can also be an eternal reference. This is definitely a worthy purchase and very economical considering the wealth of information that is offered. A strong recommendation is given, this a great grammar resource.
