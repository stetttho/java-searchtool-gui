 This is a superb production by the veteran Tito Rojas who gets better as the years go by. Not to say that his salsa was ever bad but experience really is a factor and manifests it's value especially in his last four productions: Alegria y Penas, Rompiendo Noches, Quiero Llegar a Casa and this one Perseverancia. No question about it he is on a role and he is one of the few salsa artists from Puerto Rico who can make this claim to fame. This salsa is pure, energetic, charismatic, meaningful and is great for listening or dancing. All the songs are enjoyable. That's how versatile "Perseverancia" is. Tito Rojas really out did himself this time. This is great salsa from a talented artist who has maintained a high level quality in the world of salsa. A terrific album for all fans of salsa music!
