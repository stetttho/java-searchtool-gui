 This is the perfect vocabulary handbook for those who are at an intermediate to advanced level in French but do not use the language daily and need a refresher from time to time. It contains everyday vocabulary of words broken down thematically as well as verbs with some conjugated forms. Since the lay out is so well organized it makes this handbook so easy to use and appreciate. You actually don't feel like you are studying. There are ample model phrases and idiomatic expressions that exemplify the usage of some of the key words in a phrase. I seriously recommend this mini-handbook for the casual French student.
