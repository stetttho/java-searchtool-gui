 Miles Pea has gained a new level of respect and admiration with such an inspiring production of salsas. Miles was never a salsa giant but kept producing music and has now definitely come into his own. This production is a wonderful compilation of soft salsas with well written lyrics. What's very interesting about Miles Pea's style is that the "cubanismo" element is very subtle but can be heard throughout the album. This album is predominantly for listening  rather than dancing however as with all tropical music dancing is always a possibility . If Miles Pea is new to your salsa collection this album would be a perfect debut because it displays unique creativity, cuban rhythms and a delicate voice by an artist who has finally triumphed. I highly recommend this cd.
