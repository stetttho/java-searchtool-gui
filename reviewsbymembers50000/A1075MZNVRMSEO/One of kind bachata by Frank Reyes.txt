 Frank Reyes, this guy is building quite the legacy for himself. He promised that this cd would be better than Dejame entrar en ti and I agree it's a superior cd but equal to the previous one which is incredible (as all bachata fans know). This is album is wonderful too and very convincing. There's nothing missing in this one. It's a typical Frank Reyes cd with great lyrics accompanied by danceable beats with a romantic feel. This one as well will be in the hit parade and I would not be suprised if all the bachatas make it to the top. The ones that I think stand out are: #1, #3, #6 and #7 but to each his own. If you liked his previous two albums: Amor en silencio & Dejame entrar en ti, buy this one it will blow you away.  PD. Song # 11 Esperandote is from Dejame entrar. I think this might been added to compensate for the error made because it's not on the list of songs on the previous cd but it's song #4 of Dejame entar en ti.
