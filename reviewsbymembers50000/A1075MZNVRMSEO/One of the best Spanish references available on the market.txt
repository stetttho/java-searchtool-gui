 This is a tremendous Spanish grammar reference for very advanced speakers, teachers and professors in my opinion. If you are not at any of the mentioned levels this reference will appear complicated and unmeaningful. This reference covers all the principal grammar topics and goes into detail with examples of structures and concepts that traditionally present difficulty. There are no practice exercises so for application of concepts you would have to ascertain a grammar book. The book is divided in chapters by grammar topic and of course there is a great deal of dedication to verbs and the various moods and tenses. I found this grammar reference to include the specifics about Spanish that goes beyond general knowledge as well as many pragmatic concepts that are hard to research and reference. I honestly recommend this reference for clarification of unusual Spanish grammar concepts, some explanation of pragmatic usage and for overall improvement of your Spanish grammar at a very advanced level.
