 This album is Pena Suazo in his prime. I liked it from the time I purchased in '96 and I am still inspired by it today. Although I stopped collecting albums from this band a few years ago, this one stands out amongst the ones I own along with "Candela Pura". This one has the combination of what makes Pena Suazo mambo-merengue unique i.e. fast rhythms, hard-hitting beats, crazy lyrics. Check it out, esta durisimo.
