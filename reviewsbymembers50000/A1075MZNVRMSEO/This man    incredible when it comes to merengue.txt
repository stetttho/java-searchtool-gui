 If you like Fernando Villalona's music and the best of romantic merengue, this cd is a must buy. Once again Fernando V delivers with a top quality production and one that will draw anyone's attention to this genre of merengue that has been will patented by "el Mayimbe". This album is romantic all the way both in style and lyrics. If you could appreciate his mellow voice, soft and tender merengue beats (but strong enough to be convinving merengue) give "el Nino Mimado" a try. I think this was the beginning of Fernandito's new rise in the music world (for those of you who are fans you know what I mean) because he virtually almost lost it all. But this album and the three afterwards-Confundido, Soy un Hombre Feliz and Mal Acostumbrado have placed "el Mayimbe" back where he belongs- at the top!
