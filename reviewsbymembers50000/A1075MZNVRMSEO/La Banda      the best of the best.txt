 This cd is a wonderful compilation of the greatest hits of Juan Luis Guerra's music over the years. I couldn't of compiled it better myself. If you are familiar with and like Juan Luis' music and are looking to have some of his best on one cd this one would satisfy your requirements. I like most of the songs on the album although there are some that are not good as the others. The big hits on this album that seem to always hold strong are: La Bilirrubina, Burbujas de amor, Ojal que llueva caf, El costo de la vida & Bachata Rosa. However, popularity varies from region to region. But I must say this album has power because in every Latin country that I have visited in the past and present somehow from a store, a car or a house I would here this album playing and could imagine the joy that it brings to its listeners.
