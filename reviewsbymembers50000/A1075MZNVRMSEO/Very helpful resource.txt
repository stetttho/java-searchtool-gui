 This reference focuses on mistakes that English speakers frecuently make in Spanish. The book is well organized and it is precise in its objective. The English short phrase or verb phrase is on the left side and the Spanish equivalent on the right. The book also provides quick tips as necessary that clarify potential gramatical queries. I found the book to be extemely useful because it does include the most common errors and also saves time in that you don't have to use the dictionary and sift through detailed information in search of a quick clarification. I recommend the book for intermediate to advanced level speakers but certainly can benefit beginners because the types of errors outlined can be committed by any bilingual speaker regardless of his/her level of Spanish. This is a handy and reliable reference at an extremely economical price.
