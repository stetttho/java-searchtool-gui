 This is a great album by a female bachata artist who in my esteem has the potential to succeed but whose career as a solo artist has not advanced. Perhaps due to a poor promotion or no promotion at all. However after hearing the cd and happily owing this album for a while it is difficult to justify why Casilda has not made a career for herself. This album has very sentimental bachatas. The lyrics are incredible. They are like love stories sung with great emotion. The only aspect about these bachatas that may not please its listeners is that the songs really sound similar. There is not much diversity of rhythm. If you are a fan of bachata surely enough you already know that Casilda is Raulin R's sister. She is his female vocalist. Caution: this album is extremely difficult to get I actually got the original from the record company- Platano but if you ever have a chance to sample Casilda "a solas" you will understand what I mean. The sentimentalism is incomparable. Great bachata!
