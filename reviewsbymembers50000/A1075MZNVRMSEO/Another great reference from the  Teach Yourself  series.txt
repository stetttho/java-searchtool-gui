 This book is a very concise well organized resource for advanced, fluent and native speakers who wish to improve their business Spanish speaking skills. The book provides ample business vocabulary, phrases and  brief grammatical explanations as a  reminder of how certain rules function in Spanish (one would already have to have a solid understanding of the grammar).All chapters have practice exercises for immediate application and an answer key is provided at the back of the book. The book is comprised of business scenarios and what I found particularly helpful was that they are realistic and the phrases applied are currently used by all Spanish speaking countries thus eliminating language barriers within the Spanish language. This book will definitely enable you to improve your business Spanish vocabulary and enable you to speak confidently in a professional environment. It's also key to note that it provides basic vocabulary and phrases in the business scenarios however, if you are looking for more extensive vocabulary another reference should be consulted. I recommend this reference for those who need to speak with the correct terminology from time to time in an appropriate business situation in Spanish.
