 This is the first book I read from this author and I am really pleased with her writing style. It is exact, subtle and very exquisite at the same time. I am always pleased with books that have a broad range of vocabulary but yet a unique simplicity that's makes the book an easy read. The book was interesting as I did not know what to expect from the title El amor es una droga dura.The protagonist Javier is fixated with Nora  a young model who men love to love (or at least they think do). They meet via a photo shoot  that she arranged with him and henceforth his obsession with her becomes an addiction. His goal is just to have her for one night but Nora proves to be hard to get and refuses to tie herself down to any man. The irony in the story that is revealed only at the end is that Javier has an addiction because he does drink, he did use drugs and overall had health problems (which we do learn about in the beginning) so his "addiction" to Nora could have stemmed from his other addictions. The author presents an interesting concept about the interconnection among the addictions that makes the title of the book so appropriate. It was a good read, interesting fictional literature by a good writer. I will pursue other works by Cristina Peri Rossi.
