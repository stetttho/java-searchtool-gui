 Wow...this is a great bachata album. High class, up there. Joe Veras what a sentimental man! For those of you who are bachata followers like me you know Joe Veras goes back a long way. To give you an idea of what this bachata is like it's comparable to his album "Con amor" which is one of the best bachata albums of all time in my opinion. This album is just as hypnotic once you listen to the lyrics the rhythm will just move you. This is romantic bachata great for listening but can be danced to as well. Joe Veras has definitely made his way back to the top among other great solo bachata artists such as: Raulin Rodriguez, Luis Vargas and Alex Bueno just to name a few. This is a gem of an album especially if you like sentimental bachata. Buy it...you will enjoy. This is a guarantee.
