 This is a very handy pocket dictionary that can be used as a quick reference to ascertain the definition of basic everyday words in Spanish. This is the pocket edition which has approximately 15.000 entries however in spite of its small volume of words it is still very thorough in its content. Some of key features of this basic Spanish-Spanish dictionary are: clear definitions of the key word, idiomatic expressions of the key word where applicable, geographical locations in Spanish along with the nationality of selected countries, the most frequently used acronyms in Spanish and English and a brief but helpful grammar review of verbs and the subjunctive make up the appendix . I find this dictionary to be a good reference and simply can be used to learn new words and expressions. Also because of its size it can be read as book while increasing your vocabulary at your own individual pace. In general Langenscheidt dictionaries are very thorough and complete. I recommend this for daily usage and as a reference for basic vocabulary clarification of Spanish words and idioms.
