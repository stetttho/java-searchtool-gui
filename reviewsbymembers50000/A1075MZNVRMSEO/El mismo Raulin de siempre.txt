 This compilation by Raulin Rodriguez is one of his most complete productions ever. The album reaffirms his excellence in comparison to other top bachata artists and I would even venture say that he has out done himself this time. The lyrics of every song are sentimental and heart felt and what's most impressive about Raulin is that he writes his own songs. Therefore, if his exceptional talent has not yet been recognized by the critics and fans I hope this album erases any lingering doubts. This album contains 10 fabulous songs, seven of which are bachatas, two are merenbachatas and # 10 is a "potpourri of baladas", a first time launch of this genre for Raulin. All the bachatas are excellent but I would definitely say that the platinum hits are: "Morena yo soy tu marido", "Me siento triste hoy" and the album title song "Corazon Corazon". I was also particularly impressed with the merenbachatas which have a smooth rhythm and the mix of ballads at the end just round off an already superior cd. I can not emphasize enough that this cd is a class A act and most of all its author is one of the best bachateros of today who has a wonderful career still yet to unfold. I highly recommend this purchase and also the purchase of his previous production "Soledad" which is equally as strong. His most recent production "Arrancame la vida" will also leave you speechless.
