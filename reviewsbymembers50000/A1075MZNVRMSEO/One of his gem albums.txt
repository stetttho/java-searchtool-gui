 Eddie Santiago, by far a Puerto Rican salsa legend displays his exquisite talent in this album. No doubt about this album is vibrant, lively, acoustically refreshing and sounds just the way salsa should sound. This album has a combination of rhythms, the distinction is clear however, the melodies blend perfectly which compliments an already superb album. This album is perfect for listening, dancing or background salsa. Take your pick but it is sure worth buying. Enjoy!
