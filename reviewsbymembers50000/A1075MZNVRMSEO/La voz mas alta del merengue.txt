 This is a tremendous production by Rubby Perez who is one of the strongest voices of merengue today. He definitely outweighs the common merengues groups that tend to have similar sounds but Rubby Perez is in a class by himself. This merengue is classic and is a true display of Dominican merengue with its beats, nuances and musical arrangements that exemplify this great genre that identifies el merengue dominicano. This album came out late in 1999 and some of songs were instant hits like the merengue version of Tu vas a volar and the two bachatas Para que me olvides and Volvere. If you like to dance or listen to merengue this album will definitely meet your needs. It is a typical Rubby Perez album with diversity, musicality, uniqueness and downright just fun to listen to- all the time. Do enjoy!
