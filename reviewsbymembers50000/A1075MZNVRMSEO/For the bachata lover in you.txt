 This is guy is so impressive when it comes to bachata. He really has unique talent. Once again this album is prior to the one that really put him on the map (Vine a decirte a adios) but it should not go unrecognized because this bachata is fina too indiscutiblemente. I have had this album for three years now and I play it occasionally not because it's not good but simply because I would need a lifetime to play all my bachata albums equally. In a nutshell this is a typical Frank Reyes production with all the fine trimmings. The lyrics and rhythms are catchy. If you like merenbachatas there are a few as well. The really nice tracks are: Dos mujeres un corazon and Basta ya.
