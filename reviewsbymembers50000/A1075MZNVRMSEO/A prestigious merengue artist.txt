 Prestige is the most appropriate word that I would like to use to describe this fabulous production by Rubby Perez. I place him in the category of a veteran merenguero because it seems like he has been around for so long with his traditional merengue style. This production is the one that really blew me away. It has been on the market for one year now and according to the music reviews "El Cantante" has made its mark and has been categorized as a superb production. If you are a fan of classic merengue that has romantic lyrics, strong beats, some elements of "merengue traditional-cibaeno" (song # 9) this album will meet and surpass your expectations. It also has a beautiful bolero song #6- En un beso la vida- which is stunning and well sung. There are many great tracks on this album and I usually just end up playing the whole cd from start to finish all the time. However, I do particularly like songs 1,2,4,5,6 and 9. No regrets here this merengue is classic great for listening and dancing. Truly "espectacular".
