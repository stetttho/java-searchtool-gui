 This album by Raulin has to be on the best in his repertoire one that is already a showcase of exceptional talent. I expected nothing but the best and I think Raulin delivered. This album seems to combine the various styles of bachata that Raulin has produced in the past few years. This album to me has nuances from "Arrancame la vida", "Sin Fortuna" and "Derroche de Amor" but very unique in its own right. The rhythm and lyrics of these songs I must say are the best ever. As for Casilda his forever-female vocalist has simply outdone herself this time. Every bachata that she is a part of is just incredible. Respect due she is a tremendous singer as well. All the bachatas are great. I have my favorites but no doubt about it this album can be played right through to the end. However, Ay Hombe, Es mejor, Y ahora te vas and Si no te tengo are quite impressive. The sole merengue "Mi tonto amor" is a remake of the original version. It's very well done in bachatamerengue. No question about it if you are a fan of Raulin and bachata this is a collector's album.
