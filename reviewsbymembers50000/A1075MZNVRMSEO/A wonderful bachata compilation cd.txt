 This album contains the best of bachata in 2002 all in one cd. It is a compilation of the greatest hits of artists such as: Monchy & Alexandra, Frank Reyes, Joe Veras, and Raulin Rodriguez etc. who keep delivering quality music year after year but this album has a special flavor. Each song has been carefully selected and is in the right spot on the album. Once you listen to it you will understand what I mean. It's a cd that you can listen to without interruptions. Each song is beautiful and the cd also allows you to sample music of other bachata artists that may be new to you. I recommend this compilation to bachata followers and those who wish to sample this genre of music which is a fine display of what the Dominican Republic has to offer. You won't regret this purchase.
