 This is a great salsa album by one of Colombia' finest groups. Fruko y sus Tesos is renowned for their high energy, upbeat, and percussion driven salsa. They also are masters at combining and mixing rhythms from other genres of tropical music. The salsa displayed in this album delivers as promised. The opening song is a hit and sets the stage for what is to come. For salseros this one will keep you on the floor for a while. All the salsas are terrific but I say it's the listener's choice. Songs #1, 7, 9 & 11 are the hits on this album. This is great salsa through and through and another great album by Fruko y sus tesos.
