 I listened to this cd today for first time in years and it still delivers. Los Sabrosos del Merengue a reputable PR merengue band has the talent to produce good merengue. Although the group always has members that come and go they still hold it together. This is one of their older albums (1995) but still could ignite any fiesta. The rhythm and pace is extremely upbeat and the lyrics will make you crack a smile. This one in my opinion is  one of their best albums. Some of the great merengues in this album are: El cachetero, Se le moja la canoa, Botellon and Noviecita. This is a recommended and worthy purchase.
