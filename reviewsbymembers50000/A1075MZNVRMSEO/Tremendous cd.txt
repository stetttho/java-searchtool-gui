 I loved the sound if this group the first time I heard their music. Mattizz trae algo para ti es their second album and it's authentic through and through. In my opinion Mattizz is one of the few Puerto Rican groups that produce good merengue all the time. Their music is what I call Caribbean style merengue. The nuances, beats and rhythm all conform to classic merengue which usually outlast the fast paced, high energy style which typical of a lot of groups of this genre. They have one more album in their repertoire. This one is from 1998 and it's a lovely production.
