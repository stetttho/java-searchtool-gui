 What I learned from El Chaval de la bachata is "do not judge a book by its cover". I ignored this bachata artist for years not knowing that I had been depriving myself of wonderful, lyrical and rhythmic music. This bachatero is full of talent. I really can't say anything bad about his bachata and he truly has a good voice. I was lucky to find this cd last year in the DR. I had no idea what to expect but I wanted to try his music. What a pleasant surprise it was. This is album is great. It has a nice mix of bachatas and merengues and a tribute to son cubano. Something very rare from a bachata singer. This album is highly recommended as well as his new release which I was lucky to ascertain at a store because it is not yet available on amazon. You will not be disappointed.
