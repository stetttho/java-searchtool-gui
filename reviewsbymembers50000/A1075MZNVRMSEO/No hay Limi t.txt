 This cd from Limi-t 21 is great too just like their previous one. They have definitely touched on something unique with their new style of merengue. This album in particular is extremely danceable, full of nice rhythms and very catchy lyrics. This album offers a variety of merengue styles fast, slow, upbeat, high energy whatever your preference is there is a song for you. The only song that does not fit into the selection is #7 which is more of pop/ latino tune that just has no place in a merengue album of this caliber. Other than that it's calle sabor, esquina amor all the way. Enjoy!
