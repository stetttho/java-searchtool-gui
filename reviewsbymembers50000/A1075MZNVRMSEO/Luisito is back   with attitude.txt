 No surprise to me that this album is great. Luisito Carrion is  an extremely talented salsa artist who is well known for is energetic and charismatic salsa. This album is no exception. I have owned it for two years, played it seldomly but recently started playing it again and it has been a delight. All the songs are danceable, upbeat, and puerrtorican all the way! Some songs however will definitely catch your attention and for sure you will hit the repeat button more than once. The platinum tracks are: "La chica mas popular" , Amiga mia" "Para ser real" and "Muriendo". If you like authentic salsa, purchase this one while you can because Luisito takes long absences between productions. You will enjoy it.
