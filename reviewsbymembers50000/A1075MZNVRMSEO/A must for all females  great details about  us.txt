 This is a vital handbook/ guide that should be given to all females be it young adolescent's, adults or mature women (la tercera edad). The book is incredibly diverse and loaded with a wealth of information. It covers all issues as they relate to the female body such as STD's, physical abuse, pregnancy and birth control just to name some of the many topics that surround our day-to-day lives. The information given is concise but well explained. This is a highly reliable resource that will definitely answer many questions that you and others females of all ages may have with regards to the female body and related issues. I have this version in Spanish and it's wonderful to know that these issues are exposed since they are not discussed enough amongst young Hispanic females with their adult counterparts. It's great to know that the female youth have an excellent resource such as this one available on the market.
