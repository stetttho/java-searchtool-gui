 I bought this album blindly in 2001 not knowing anything about "Nueva Era" prior to my purchase but I was confident that their bachata would have an authentic rhythm and sound. This group is Dominican (from NY) but have captured the authenticity of bachata music. The album has a nice line up of songs with wonderful lyrics that have meaning and a story behind the words. I was not too keen about the merengues but other than that this group has potential. The only way they would not succeed is if they get caught up in producing mainstream bachata which usually includes English lyrics. A recommended purchase.
