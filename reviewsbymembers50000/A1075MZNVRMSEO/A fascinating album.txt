 This album by Raulin is fascinating that is just the only way to describe it. This production follows his landmark album Medicina de amor and the talent continues. I drove around Miami six years ago for a day trying to find a store that had it and I eventually did find it.  It was worth the search. Once again Raulin gives us his heart and soul in his lyrics and in his voice both evidenced in all these bachatas. I remember the first time I listened to this album I thought that Raulin had taken a big jump in maturity. He just seems so mature in this production and so in control. There are plenty of bachatas in this album that you will enjoy. The most popular songs from this one which surely enough you will recognize are: Dame corazon, Amor de mi vida, Si supieras and El amor da vida. In a nutshell I like all of the bachatas and I do not care for the merengues at all. In total there are four. Raulin....what can I say. You are the best! I hope you enjoy this great romantic bachata album.
