 This a majestic bachata album filled with beautiful lyrics and  mayimbe rhythms. Antony Santos, a pillar bachatero and unique creator of catchy bachata beats continues in the same fashion with this new release "Vuelve amor". This album has a nice variety of bachatas. All are terrific. The three merengues are average, the only one I liked was the remake of A Dios le pido. It has a very smooth tropical feel to it. The bachatas that are potential chart busters in my opinion are: #1, Ay, ay, ay, #4 Ay amor, #5 Chocolate hay en tu pecho, # 7 Vuelve amor. I will confess #4 is my favorite. If you are an Antony Santos style bachata fan this is a great album for your "bachat" collection. Enjoy it!
