 This album showcases some of Fernando's best songs in bachata. This is the public's first glimpse of "el Mayimbe" singing this genre and it is very impressive. If you are familiar with Fernando Villalona's style then there are no surprises here. As usual his voice is soft and he sings with true sentiment. Definitely this album will be heart felt by anyone who purchases it. The change of rhythm from merengue to bachata was will transitioned and the beat is that of true bachata, which emphasizes the already present romantic tone. Although the songs are not new releases, this album is still great to have especially if you are a fan of Fernando Villalona's music. Strong recommendation.
