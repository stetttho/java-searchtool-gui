 I was in Santo Domingo all last week and I had to go to quite a few stores before I could get a copy of this album. I right away suspected that it must be great because many of stores were sold out of Sin ti. I finally did purchase a copy and wow... I was taken aback by how impressive it is. Antony Santos has been on a role with this new style of bachata that he has created since El balazo. Where do I begin- this album is a continuation of Juego de amor (which I am still enjoying) and now El Mayimbe comes with Sin ti, which is full wonderful bachatas. I suspect the big hits will be: Sin ti, La Jaula de oro, and Damelo'to but don't underestimate the other three. They are equally as good. I especially like # 7 Se acabara mi suerte. The mellowest bachata of the group is No es bueno but a nice one indeed. The merengues are tremendous too. I like the rhythm of La camarera (it's not really merengue. It has a nice "son tropical" beat), El Gato triste will definitely get a crowd moving and Yolanda, a merencumbia that sounds terrific. I say Antony Santos really produced a gem of an album, which definitely should keep his bachata fans coming back for more. No question about it ... . Do enjoy.
