 Aqui esta la bachata vol.9 is just as great as all the other productions of this series. I hesitated buying the cd for many months because I was not enticed by the line up of songs but I finally did purchase it and it is really a wonderful compilation cd of bachatas that were outstanding in 2002. There is not much else I can say but the songs on this cd are of some of the finest, sentimental and will definitely move you if you are looking for bachatas that have meaningful lyrics and great rhythm. The only flaw is the merengues that have been included. They don't enhance the cd in any way and could have easily been replaced by bachatas. If this is your first taste of this series by Platano Records you will not be disappointed. This cd is great and so are many previous editions such as vol.1, 4, 6, and 8. This is great bachata, don't miss out on owning this wonderful compilation cd.
