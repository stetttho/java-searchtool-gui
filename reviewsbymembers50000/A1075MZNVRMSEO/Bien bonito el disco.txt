 This cd volume 5 of this promising series encompasses some extraordinary bachata songs from renowned artists of this category. This volume in particular is extremely mellow and all the bachatas are of the genre "bachata romntica" which makes for very easy listening. The selections were well chosen and Platano Records has included the most popular hits of the year of each artist that figures in this cd. It has more merenbachatas than expected of which two are definitely what is known as "merengue ripiao" for those of you who are real connoisseurs of tropical music. You will smooth sail through this cd until track #10 and there begins three merengues in a row. Although I tend not to like the inclusion of merengue tracks in this compilation, I still recognize that the cd was carefully organized and the selection of songs was based on popularity. Once again this compilation of the series "Aqu est la bachata" is a great buy and would enrich your collection of bachata music.
