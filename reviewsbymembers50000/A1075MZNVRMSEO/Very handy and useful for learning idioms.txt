 This is a very hand dictionary of English/ Spanish proverbs if you are looking to learn idioms and the equivalent form in both languages. There is an array of options and in many cases multiple ways to say the same expression. Therefore you can choose which one you would like to learn and use. There is a broad variety and the book offers more than 2000 proverbs. The only surprising aspect about this dictionary is that it does not offer an explanation of what the proverb means in either of the languages. Although sometimes proverbs may seem easy to understand one can misinterpret the intended meaning. An explanation is always proof positive of what the expression means and examples in sentence would be beneficial as well. This book would be helpful to natives of English, Spanish and students that are Intermediate level and up in both languages. This is a recommended reference material and fun to read through as you learn these everyday and sometimes old fashion sayings.
