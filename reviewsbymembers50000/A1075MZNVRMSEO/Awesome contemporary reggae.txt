 This is definitely one my favorite contemporary reggae albums. I purchased it at the time of release and fourteen years later I still can't get enough. I am not a fan of hard reggae but definitely appreciate this genre of the music and Maxi Priest just combines all the right elements to give it a smooth, elegant but definitely reggae feel. Bonafide surely gave him unprecedented recognition because it is the production after Wild World, which opened the doors to a great contemporary era in reggae- the 90's. This cd is a winner through and through. You probably will listen to it several times before taking a breather. My favorites are Best of me, You and Sure fire love. Treat yourself to this "Bonafide" album. This is contemporary reggae in its splendor.
