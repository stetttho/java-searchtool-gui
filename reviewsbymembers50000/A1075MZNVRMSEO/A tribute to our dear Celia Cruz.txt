 This is another tremendous album by the late Celia Cruz- la guarachera del mundo. As usual this album is nothing but excellence and a true representation of Celias spririt and philosophy about life- la vida es un carnaval y hay que vivirla cantando. Her tremendous talent, charisma, professionalism and vivacious nature kept the world dancing for fifty years and will keep the world dancing for fifty more years thanks to this tremendous album (and all the others). The international hit on this album is "la vida es un carnaval" but all are tremendous and once again Celia shows her diversity by including other rhythms- a merengue (a duet with Kinito Mendez) and a bolero that is just so sentimental and so Celia Cruz. This album is her first production with Sony discos and I assure you the new style, sound and energy are just so typical of "la guarachera". I cant express this anymore clearly. This is a production that is platinum and will defintely keep Celia in our hearts for ever. I cheerish her music and will keep dancing in the name of this tremendous singer of tropical music. Celia is truly a "reina".
