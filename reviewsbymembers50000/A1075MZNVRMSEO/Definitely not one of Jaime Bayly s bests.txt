 This is an interesting book by Jaime Bayly in the sense that it's just a serious of confessions in the form of letters that were written to various people who were a part of his life at one point of time and in the letters he expresses repent, sorrow, sentimental feelings etc. The book comes across as one in which Jaime Bayly once again reveals the intimacies and at this point complexities of his life. However, what are consistent in this book and others of his that I have read are his language skills and his unique way of expressing himself, which I think, is his strongest attribute. In a nutshell, this is a book with no real plot and the letters written to various friends he once had do not necessarily relate to each other. If you like Jaime Bayly it may be a worthwhile read otherwise you may want to read his other more credible works such as: Yo amo a mi mami and No se lo digas a nadie.
