 I bought this album in 1996 and always enjoyed it from the first day I listen to it. Not to familiar with Bonny Cepeda's style prior to this purchase I virtually based my hopes of liking the album on one song of his that I absolutely cherish called "Algo le di yo" which is just a classic merengue from a treasure album of his that I stumbled upon called "El Mandamas" which is an untouchable recording now. This one "Nueva Etapa" is on the money. It is rhythmic, upbeat, has great musical arrangements and is hard hitting at times. This is the kind of merengue that can be enjoyed at home or in a private party with friends. To be honest with you I have never heard any of the songs played in the clubs but not to say they would not entertain a nightclub crowd. These songs have funny lyrics and definitely can be deemed as "dance merengue". If you have a chance to sample these songs before purchasing the album I recommend: Quema, Heavy, Me aumentaron, y Quien te pinto la camisa. Great album from a group that has limited presence in the world of merengue.
