 This is definitely one of Guayacan's best and by far the most creative musical production in their repertoire. As you know this group has a reputable musical history and has been producing superb salsa and other tropical rhythms since the eighties. "Guayacan" style music has always been placed in a class by itself and when reviewed by musical critics this  group continues to receive the highest recognition for their ability to diversify their salsa style while still consistently occupying a top spot in that musical category. This particular album is excellent because Guayacan has fused all tropical rhythms in the same album and each song exemplifies this unusual ability to combine salsa with cumbia, swing and reggae while still maintaining the uniqueness of each musical genre and an extremely upbeat tempo. If you like Guayacan and salsa you definitely will enjoy this musical work of art because it does not get any better than this. The first song has wonderful lyrics and a split rhythm -salsa combined with reggae. Song #4- Son polizn and Song #9- El famoso are classic fast salsas that will have you running to the dance floor to exhibit your moves and I must mention the swing sound that ignites "Besos bajo la lluvia- song #3 . "Con sabor tropical' has once again elevated the status of Orquesta Guayacan not only in Colombia but around the world. This is a tremendous album by a tremendous group. Que sabor..Que viva Cali!
