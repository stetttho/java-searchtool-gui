 Luis Vargas is on a role. This album is his third in a row with that new sounding rhythm that has enabled Luis V to step back into the arena of great bachateros. I held off buying this album and really just deprived myself of bachata that has traditional Luis Vargas style rhythms and GREAT merengues. This album is absolutely fabulous, danceable and simply great for easy listening. His new release Inolvidable (2005) is incredible too!
