 I was pleased with content of this video as it gives a brief but sufficient overview of key attractions, tourist sites and scenery of the natural landscape of the Dominican Republic. This video is a good overview for those who would like to know a little bit about the DR before visiting the country. The journey begins in Puerto Plata in the north and continues down to the capital, Santo Domingo in the South. Along the way there is some scenery of the Cibao Valley and Santiago, the DRs most important industrial region. We also get a glimpse of La Romana and the historical village of Altos de Chavn. Once in Santo Domingo, you will see other historical sites such as the first church in the New World and "el faro a Coln" (a lighthouse built in honour of Cristbal Colon). Overall the video is enlightening and inspiring and will broaden your knowledge of cultural, historical and geographical aspects of the Dominican Republic. I think it could have been more extensive with more cultural icons as well as details about Dominicans and Dominican history but certainly the video will interest those who wish to know some historical and geographical information about the DR.
