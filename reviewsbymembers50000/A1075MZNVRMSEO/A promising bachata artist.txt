 I liked this bachatero from the moment I heard his songs on two "Bachata Hits" compilation cds- 2001 & 2002. No one would ever believe that Wilbert Manuel is one of the new and upcoming bachata artists that has yet to become a superstar as bachata music becomes increasingly competitive and international. It won't be long however before Wilbert Manuel will be among many artists in the "hit parades". His voice, the lyrics and acoustics in this cd are all of high class. There is nice mix of danceable and romantic bachatas and all the songs are of top caliber. I assure you there will be no skipping of the tracks when you listen to this cd. If anything you will hit the repeat button several times. As mentioned all the songs are worthy of praise however my favorite is: "Por tu amor luchare". Give this album a try. It's well worth your money. (Other bachata artists comparable to Wilbert Manuel are: Frankely, Junior & Jorge and Alex Rosario).
