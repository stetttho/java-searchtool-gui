 This album contains a mixture of romantic merengue rhythms along with fast,up beat tempo songs that once again exemplify Too's unique versitality. The songs in this cd are very melodic and the beauty of each one is reinforced by Tono's powerful and convincing voice. The cd begins with a stunning merengue balad that is enriched with the classic caribbean merengue sound and many other songs in the album follow suit. The two most renowned ones are: Otra como tu (a remake of a balad in merengue by Tono) and Sin Truco (nightclub style merengue). This album is what I label as "continous play" because there is no need to skip tracks on this cd. I highly recommend this purchase because it is complete with eight wonderful merengues that will no doubt become a part of Tono's gold collection.
