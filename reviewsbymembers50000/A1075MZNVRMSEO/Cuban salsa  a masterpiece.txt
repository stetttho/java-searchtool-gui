 This is one of a kind salsa that definitely reminds us of its origin-Cuba! I purchased this album on a whim. I saw the cover, read the list of songs on the back and realized instantly that it was Cuban salsa and decided to purchase the album. What a wonderful find because this kind of salsa is exclusive in nature and cherished only by its most loyal fans. This salsa has all the elements of Cuban son melanged with some other Cuban rhythms that just round off an already polished cd. It's the listener's choice however, I say every song on this album is top notch for nightclub dancing (Although I have never heard this kind of good salsa in a club yet) and for any kind of party. The lyrics too uplift the cd, great vocals and acoustics. From the on set song #1- Que me pidan regalao, #3- Anoche Llor and #6- Acaramelao left me yearning for more of this kind of unique Cuban music. To all salsa aficionados (of salsa from Cuba) this one is for you!
