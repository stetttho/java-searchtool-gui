 1001 Pitfalls in Spanish is a tremendous reference for a select group. Meaning it's extremely helpful to advanced students and educators of the Spanish language. It definitely fills in the gaps about the specifics that can possibly be found in other references but not as hands on. The grammar specifics covered are mostly pragmatic concepts about Spanish and usually they relate to the differences between English and Spanish, which make pitfalls so difficult to overcome. The book is well divided into three main sections: Parts of Speech, Sentence Structure and Special Topics. This book will definitely clarify some queries that you may have. It will prove beneficial once you keep in mind that it is not a grammar book but rather a grammar reference. This is a great reference for those who are natives, advanced students and teachers.
