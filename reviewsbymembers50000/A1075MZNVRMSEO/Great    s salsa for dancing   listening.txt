 This cd is a great tribute to Salsa in the 90's. Overall there were many great productions by artists who were in their prime and now have slowed down, phased out or are on hiatus. This cd is a great reminder of songs that were popular and even brought fame to an artist. If you were a salsa follower in the 90's this cd could only bring back good memories and if you are new to salsa this cd is a good intro although the music is about eight years old. It starts off with the ever popular Celia Cruz a song "Sazn" from her album "Azucar Negra". As the title states the song is full of "sazn". Some other nice tracks are: Luna negra by Rey Ruiz who has quietly disappeared from the salsa scene, "Hasta que te conoci" which brought fame to Marc Anthony who is now a star that has risen, "Idilio" a nightclub favourite for salsa dancers by Willie Coln and Victor Manuelle's "Ests tocando fuego" -quite a danceable salsa in it's own right. Once again this is a great production by the Salsa en la Calle 8 series and if you want to reminisce a bit buy this edition while you can- you won't regret it.
