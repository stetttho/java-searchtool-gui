 I suppose Pedro Juan Gutierrez may actually be getting bored with his own uneventful life because this book Carne de Perro is a continuation of the episodes of his life that have been related in other books but the only difference is he has become more mellow in his style which coincides with the slow down of the events throughout the years of hardship. In Carne de Perro we see the same Pedro Juan G that we have seen in Trilogia sucia de la Habana, El insaciable hombre arana and Animal Tropical, one who is starving for a promising future, food, and  women on a regular basis. His life in Cuba is a destitute one and the readers learn a little bit about life in a socially and economically repressed country whose revolution has failed miserably. Who are the victims?- the Cubans.  Pedro G in Carne de Perro tells it just like it is but with much less anger and resentment. I enjoyed the book. It was short but the message was sent. It also was an easy read because I read all the others he has written and I have seen the different stages of the protagonist- Pedro Juan G in each book.
