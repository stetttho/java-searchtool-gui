 Wow I forgot how nice this compilation cd is with its great line up some popular mid-90's merengue. After many years of not listening to it today I was reinspired and relived some memories of a nice period when merengue had some good groups such as: Rikarena, Zafra Negra and  Zona Roja. Most have phased out now but there's nothing like going back to an old cd to rekindle the flame. This cd seems to have it all, the songs flow well together and have similar rhythms and styles. If you were an avid fan of merengue between 1994-1997 this cd should be to your liking because it has some of the really popular songs like: Algo le di yo, Cumande, Lo que no conviene se deja, Salvaje and Corazon Salvaje. This is a wonderful cd compilation mix for listening and dancing.
