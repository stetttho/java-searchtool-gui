 What can I say, Sabor a mi details events of the author's life - Pedro Juan Gutierrez- during  a specific time frame which includes his years in jail and when he was set free again to roam the streets of Cuba. If you are familiar with other books that he wrote prior to this one- Trilogia sucia de la Habana, Animal Tropical etc. you will understand that his books do not really have plots or a continuos story-line. The chapters detail events that have happened to him and Sabor a mi is no exception. Sabor a mi depicts Cuba in the nineties and the day to day strife of its people. Through the daily episodes of Pedro Juan G the reader gets an understanding of how some of the most destitute Cubans live. In a nutshell, some have resorted to selling themselves just to survive because there is no other  alternative unless they meet a foreigner or have become vagabonds over the years. It's an average book but Pedro Juan needs to move on. His books have repetitive themes and situations.
