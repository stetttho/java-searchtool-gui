 Paulo Coehlo has moved himself up to the forefront of Latin-American literature once again with this his most recent novel Once Minutos. I have not read much of his works but this novel caught my attention after reading the summary at the back of the book. I was immediately intrigued by the real life aspect of the themes and decided to purchase this potential bestseller. The book lived up to its expectations. It's full of intrigue and the life the protagonist Mara is an interesting one from start to finish. We meet her first in her homeland Brazil and then later she moves to Switzerland and becomes a prostitute with the hopes of turning her life around for the better with the money that she earns. We learn of the emotional roller coaster that Maria experiences from being with many men and indeed she does meet some out of the ordinary clients who my opinion in some way cause her internal conflicts but out from those experiences Maria learns interesting life lessons. I also think the title of the book is so appropriate which is explained about a quarter of the way through which is a reflection of creative thinking by Paulo Coehlo. In a nutshell, this is beautiful literature not so much for the writing style but because the themes allow one to relate closely to the protagonist. A truly emotional book as it allows the reader to feel so many emotions: sadness, pain, grief and hope. No question about it Once Minutos is a potential best-seller by far my favorite by this author.
