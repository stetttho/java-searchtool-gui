 This is an attractive and superior quality cd player for the price. I have the newer version (model EJ-D361) which is the same as this one I see no difference. I am quite pleased with the performance of this unit thus far. It plays very clearly, the bass output is superb, it allows for high volume and the battery life is incredible. Since I purchased the unit 3 weeks ago I have not changed the battery and I use the cd player daily. The only flaw is the anti-skip protection. It has skipped upon numerous occasions when walking briskly however, I am still trying to decipher whether there is real flaw because it could be a wiring problem with my set of headphones. Other than that this is a great unit for daily usage. The headphones are okay but quite big considering there are other smaller more practical ones on the market.  If you are looking for a slim, light, inexpensive unit with great sound this SONY unit will more than suffice.
