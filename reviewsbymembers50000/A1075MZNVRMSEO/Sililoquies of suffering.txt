 This is the first novel that I read by this author and I will definitely pursue reading more of her works. Mercedes Salisachs has a unique writing style and the ability to express herself eloquently with beautiful prose and carefully selected vocabulary. This novel is a soliloquy about the author's life and the two principle men who have caused her grief, happiness, pain and the ability to "love" over the course of time. Sagra, the main character is torn between the dedication she feels towards her husband Jaime and the secret love she feels for her brother-in-law Juan Luis. A marriage doomed from the start in my opinion due to Sagra not being the ideal one for Jaime (class segregation) and also her being infertile the relationship has many ups and downs. Via Sagra's sililoquies throughout the book the novel is a story of woman in love, out of love, confused and hurt who never really finds true happiness.
