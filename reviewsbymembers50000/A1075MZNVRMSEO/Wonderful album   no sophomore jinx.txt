 Zacarias' number one attribute is his voice. It stands all the time and it's definitely his trademark. This bachata has a bit of everything; good lyrics, plenty of rhythm, it is very danceable or it is great for just relaxing listening. I owned this album for years now and unfortunately I did pay too much attention to it until recently. The big hit from this album is the first song El Triste but others very worthy of recognition are Dame un beso and Si tu me dices ven. If you like merengue with your bachata Zach offers this too and they are quite good. If you are looking to sample his music this album is quite exemplary. In total he has 4 productions and this is one of the best.
