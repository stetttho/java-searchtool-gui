 This concert at United Palace on DVD is a true gift to all Antony Santos fans for those who attended and did not attend the concert. The setting is nothing fancy at all but the sound quality on this DVD is excellent and Antony Santos entertained his fans with traditional bachata favorites, merengue classics and some on stage entertainment at the end. I especially liked the selection of concert songs. Classics such as La pasola, Los algodones, Consejo de padre, Voy pa'lla and many others. El Mayimbe with his great improvisation is in top form in this concert. Don't miss out on this tremendous DVD.
