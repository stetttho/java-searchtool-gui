 This album by Fernando Villalona is ultimatey one of my favorites by him and in merengue in general. This album is very significant in that it is his come back album after having almost totally destroyed his career and losing it all. This is classic romantic merengue that is so danceable and so great to listen to. I will not dare to single out one song in particular but rest assured this one can be listened to from start to finish since all the songs are terrific and the rhythm is just perfect. It is not too soft but hard hitting enough to get you dancing. This album is definitely up there with the greatest of all time in this genre. Give it a try...you will not regret it.
