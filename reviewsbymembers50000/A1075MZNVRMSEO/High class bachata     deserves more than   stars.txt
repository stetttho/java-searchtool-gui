 "Derroche de amor" is another classic masterpiece by Raulin Rodriguez, the so-called "Cacique del amargue". Believe me there is no "amargue" here. This album is full of great rhythms, excellent vocals and fantastic musical arrangements. I expected nothing less from Raulin but really this album truly elevates his bachata to a dimension that few artists will share with him. Not only does this album stand as proof but he has 10 another productions to back up his quality and uniqueness as a bachata singer.  This album has an excellent selection of songs, as mentioned previously wonderful acoustics, smooth rhythms and great vocals by Raulin himself and his sister Casilda. "Derroche de amor" is a "hit" and confirms that Raulin is one of the most consistent and popular bachateros of today. He managed this achievement by his natural gift as a song writer and by the songs that have become bestsellers over the years. All of which have made his career a pathway to excellence. Additionally, bachata music has reached levels of international popularity never before in its history and Raulin is up there with all the other popular Dominican artists. The album is excellent through and through. Every song can be easily classified as #1 but personal preferences will dictate otherwise. Personally, I like the whole album but always hit the repeat button after #3 Me pregunto por que, #5 Si pudiera, #7 Me olvide de vivir, # 8 Ya no. This is great bachata not to be missed if you are a true lover of this music.  PD. I previously had reviewed this cd but it was removed because it was written in Spanish.
