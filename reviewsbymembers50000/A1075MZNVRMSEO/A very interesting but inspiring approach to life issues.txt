 The Four Agreements is a very inspiring book especially for those who are looking for insight and a new perspective on how to face and resolve daily challenges. Instead of psychoanalyzing possible root causes to life's ups and downs, Don Miguel Ruz simplified the analysis and found the answers by grouping the solutions into four agreements. What's best about this book is its simplicity and clarity thus enabling all readers to enjoy and understand the uncomplicated but profound message that lies behind each agreement. Once you have read this book, you will realize that it is also an everyday guide that will take you through the forever-challenging path called "life". I highly recommend this reading because the book is uplifting and presents a unique approach to our day-to-day crossroads.
