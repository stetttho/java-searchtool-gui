 I like this album and I am totally surprised because I am an Aventura fan, I do not have there previous album "We broke the rules" and I do not plan on purchasing it. I bought this one because I was browsing, I saw it and thought so many people cannot be wrong about a group and it's talent. I heard so much about Aventura that I decided to buy it. Well, I must say it was a pleasant surprise because although the type of bachata they sing is not my first choice the album is melodic with very smooth flowing rhythms. I think Avenutra may even be better at merengue "tipico and tradicional". There a few merengues on this cd and they are great! This bachata seems to be a genre of bachata that might lead us into the future (although possibly not because it's a Dominican-York style but all music has it's audience). It would be hard to knock off the big players like Antony Santos, Luis Vargas and Joe Veras but definitely Aventura has a younger target audience. In a nutshell, if you like Aventura and you like this style of bachata you will like this album. The group has delivered. Do not hesitate to try it.
