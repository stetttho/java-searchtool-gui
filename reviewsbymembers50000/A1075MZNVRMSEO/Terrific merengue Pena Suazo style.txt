 I stumbled across this album a few years ago not really intending to buy anything but could not resist purchasing it. Even without hearing it I had faith in Banda Gorda's previous albums which are quite good. This one is no exception to the rule, it has a good mix of merengue styles; fast, mambo, up beat it should meet the needs of all. The most sentimental and catchy song on the album is Aqui, pero alla. It perfectly explains the sentiment of Dominicans who left their land for better but their hearts are still in their country. Very touching, that song alone makes the album worthwhile. There's a nice cumbia as well- Besos-, a first for Banda Gorda. If you like this style of merengue-mambo, this album is a must!
