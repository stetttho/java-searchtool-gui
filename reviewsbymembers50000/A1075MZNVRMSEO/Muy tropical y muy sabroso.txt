 "Destino" is truly a beautiful cd with very tropical sounding salsas different from the Rey Ruiz slow pace traditional rhythm. I was pleasantly surprised when I first bougt this album because the change from salsa suave to salsa "tropical" was unexpected but certainly a welcome change. This album has very upbeat and danceable salsas and the change of acoustic arrangements is immediately evident in this cd. All the songs encompass beats that were wonderfully mastered to produce salsas rhythms that are unique in sound and tempo. As usual Rey' s voice is outstanding and excels in every song. "Destino" is a worthy purchase as are all his other productions if you are a fan of Rey Ruiz. This is definitely one of his most complete releases under Sony Discos. A strongly recommended purchase.
