 Thus far out of all the books I have read about Cuba and its foreign tourists who go there for pleasure, which includes endless female encounters and excessive drinking, this book is the least intriguing. Although the themes are interesting and thus has the potential to be an exciting novel it lacks the exciting narrative that I have seen from others authors like Pedro Juan Gutierrez and Jordi Sierra who have addressed the same issues. The author should have been more daring and more revealing with his vocabulary, an aspect that would have created intrigue and curiosity. Overall the book was okay but too simple which made the read quite mundane at times. The characters were developed but relatively simple and predictable. In this novel the two main characters Mariano and Armando visit Cuba with the hopes of having the typical vacation that male Spaniards have in Cuba. They do have some encounters with a few women of the night but Mariano also gets to see the other side of the Cuban struggle through his relationship with a local, a Cuban female doctor who becomes his love interest. If you are interested in reading about prostitutes in Cuba and Spaniards who go there to solicit their services Jordi Sierra's books Regreso a la Habana and La noche de la jinetera are my suggested readings. Both are excellent novels on the subject matter and much better narrated than this one.
