 I was very pleased with this dictionary when I purchased it recently. I wanted a reliable English/Spanish dictionary for everyday usage and this one stood out among the selection that was available. Not only does it provide a translation of the word in question but it has ample examples of word usage in a phrase, idioms, fixed phraseology and it's quite up to date. There is also a Spanish verb conjugation table of model regular and irregular verbs as guide to correct verb conjugation. I recommend this dictionary to beginner and intermediate Spanish students and to those who are using the Spanish language on a daily basis. It's a great quick reference tool. This is a worthy and economical purchase.
