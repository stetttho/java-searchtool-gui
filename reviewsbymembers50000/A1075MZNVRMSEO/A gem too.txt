 This compilation cd is a gem too. Just like its counterpart Bachatahits 2005 this cd reassures merengue fans that merengue is still a force to be reckoned with. I was not sure what to expect since merengue has slowed down somewhat over the past few years but this cd reunites the best of the best of 2004 for 2005 all in one cd. The cd has a nice variety of merengue golpeito, suave and tipico. You will enjoy it. No doubt about it.
