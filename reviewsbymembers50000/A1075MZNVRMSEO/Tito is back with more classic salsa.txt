 This release by Tito Gomez is by far one his best albums. This album displays Tito's unique talent for salsa and contains beautiful upbeat rhythms. All the songs are lively, extremely danceable and bring out the fervor and strength of his voice. After a wonderful production-"Agradecimiento" in 1993, it's comforting to know that Tito Gomez still continues to deliver some of best salsa that "la musica tropical" has to offer. This album does have some exceptional tracks and they are: Deseos y delirios, Rosas y espinas and Volver. If you are a fan of Tito Gomez or simply a fan of salsa, you will enjoy this one. No doubt about it!
