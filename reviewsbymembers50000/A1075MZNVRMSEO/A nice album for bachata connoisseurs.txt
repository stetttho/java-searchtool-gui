 Aqui esta la bachata vol 3 has a lot of variety if you wish to sample different types of bachata. I remember when I first listened to it I was surprised that it was so diverse. There are songs from artists who each have a unique bachata rhythm, voice and style. These compilations give you the opportunity to sample the songs first before buying the album and then getting stuck with a cd that you don't care for. In general the bachatas on this compilation are quite slow, not for dancing at all so if your looking for the more fast paced style try another volume. This is true "amargue" and "penas". Overall the selections are appropriate. The common songs are: Mi papa,  Si supieras, Hasta cuando, Por un chin de amor and El amor da vida. I do not think these songs went platinum but they should be known to loyal bachata followers. Overall a nice album to have especially if you are collecting the series.
