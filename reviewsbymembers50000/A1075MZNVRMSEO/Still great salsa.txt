 Salsa en la calle 8 '98 is still such a wonderful cd to own if you are looking for a thorough salsa compilation cd. I think it was a great year for salsa in general and whenever I play the cd it reminds me of the artists and songs that were popular at that time. The songs fall under the category of romantic salsa but with a fast tempo. They are definitely all danceable. The most popular songs are: Arrepentida, Bongo (a nightclub favorite), He tratado (a nightclub gem as well) and Juliana (a salsa lover's delight). This edition is better than some of the newer Calle 8 editions, don't let the year fool you, this salsa is still popular among the connoisseurs of this genre and salsa dancers in general. I sincerely recommend this purchase.
