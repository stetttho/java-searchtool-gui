 Heaven is the word. That's where this kind bachata will take you. Whenever I listen to music from He Pepo it just takes you back to another era. His music I classify as an older style. It's definitely for the mature crowd (and not in age) meaning for those who appreciate the older formula. The lyrics are authentic, well sung and the style is a classic slow rhythm. This is great music with a yesteryear feeling not for the average bachata crowd. Almost like a throw back to another era. Play this one and I assure you will not stop the cd until it is done. He Pepo....you have out done yourself in this one. A classic cd. Do enjoy!
