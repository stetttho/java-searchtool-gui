 Luis Segura gets more sentimental with age. I am convinced. I liked this album right from the start. It is a typical Luis Segura bachata production. Why I say this?  The rhythms, the lyrics and his voice are all exemplary of the type of bachata we have heard from El Papa over the years.   If you like bachata that is mainly for listening rather than dancing, this production may appeal to you. The themes are always about love and relationships- good or bad. The only song that I am not fond of is #6 which is merenbachata. In my opinion it does not enhance the cd in any way and #12 is the house version which is totally a contrast to the style of this artist which is very unique, classic and very different from the bachata that we here today. Check it out.
