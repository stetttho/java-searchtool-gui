 This is by far my favorite album by Luis Vargas. This one reminds me of "Volvio el dolor" which was his most successful album of all time. The bachatas on this cd are romantic, delicate, soft and rhythmic. You will definitely relate to what I am saying once you sample this bachata "en persona". All the bachatas are great both for listening and dancing. Traditionally I am not a fan of the merengues included by bachata singers but they are great too. Luis really rose to the occasion this time and just in time when bachata has acquired a rising interest on an international level. I was particularly pleased with "Dos hombres bebiendo" and "Yo mismo la vi". I recommend this album to all fans of bachata and fans of Luis Vargas. This particular album is a treasure.
