 Good compilations cds are still a rare find. Meaning a compilation cd that truly has a series of songs that can be enjoyed without skipping through it. This one is a gem and if you have been following bachata music over the past few years you will definitely be able to identify and relate to this beautiful line up of songs. It has some popular bachatas: Viv, Chica de mi barrio & Quin eres t and some artists that are new to the genre (i.e. Domenic M & Vanessa Gil). If you like diversity in bachata this is a cd that exemplifies the beauty and diversity that bachata has to offer. A strongly recommended purchase.
