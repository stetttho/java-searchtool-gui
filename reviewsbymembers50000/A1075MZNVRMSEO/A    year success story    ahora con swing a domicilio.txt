 When I purchased this album, I honestly did not know what to expect from a group that has a successful 25 year flawless music history. Los Hermanos Rosario are truly talented and gifted because they always seem to come up with a unique production that keeps their fans chanting and dancing for many years to come. "Swing a domicilio" is no exception. This is some serious merengue not to be taken lightly. They still have that touch and have added two new genres to their repertoire. This is album contains their staple music, merengue and surprisingly enough one bachata (excellent) and one cumbia (well done). Amazingly all the merengues have new nuances which set their merengue apart from other groups. Something I noticed right from the beginning, this "swing" has a very unique caribbean flavor. To say which song or songs are best, it's your choice but one thing that is certain is these are the Hermanos Rosario of old- full of joy, spirit and fervor. No doubt about it this album is representative of their success story and I strongly recommend this purchase to all fans of los Hermanos Rosario and merengue lovers in general. It's new, it's wild, it's untamable, it's swing....a domicilio! Doy las gracias a los Hermanos Rosario por tantos aos de merengue y de xito. En verdad su merengue es bomba. Pa'lante mis hermanos.
