 This is one of the greatest "Greatest hits" compilations that I own in any music category. However, in this genre I must admit they don't come like this anymore. I seldomly listen to this genre of music (unless it's on the radio) but when I do you bet the police is one of cds in the cd changer.  This group has earned their infamous reputation and this compilation is just a summary of their excellence. All their top hits are included most likely based on popularity. I like all but one. So if you are considering buying just one Police album for your collection this one would be ideal. It also brings back great memories of great era in music.
