 This is definitely one the best productions by Limi-t 21 since their existence as a merengue band. Actually this is the first production I purchased from them and let me tell you  I was blown away. This merengue is upbeat, contagious and down right fun music. It has all the components of "good merengue" in particular strong beats, great musical arrangements and hard hitting sounds. If you own any of their previous recordings you will definitely notice the difference in style. They have switched from a slower traditional sounding merengue to fast paced, high energy rhythms. I think the new sound of Limi-t 21 is definitely marketable and it will put them in the "hit parade" without a doubt.  I won't list all the goods songs because it would mean listing the whole album. So if you try this one I assure you will enjoy it from start to finish. This is their best yet!
