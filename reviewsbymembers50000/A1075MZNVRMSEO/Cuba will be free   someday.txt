 This book is great reflection of Cuban society today and the dreams that Cubans have for a better life. It shows that all levels of society are suffering equally (although the socialist model insists that there is no disparity). Through the principal characters of the novel Daina Chaviano expresses their past, present and future in a comical, real and unique manner. This book is definitely a worthy read not only for the content but also for the language and unique writing style of this exemplary Cuban novelist. Her use of the Spanish language is exquisite and impeccable.
