 If you purchase this compilation cd, you will be listening to some of best merengues that were released in 1999 and 2000. The cd was wonderfully compiled with merengues from some of the greatest singers of this category. All the songs are danceable, upbeat and rhythmic. If you don't have music from all of these singers, the cd gives you the opportunity to sample the different styles of merengue that is unique to each artist. I highly recommend this purchase to all merengue fans. Great compilation cd!
