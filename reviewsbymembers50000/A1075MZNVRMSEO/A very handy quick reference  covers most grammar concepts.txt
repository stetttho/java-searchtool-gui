 This a handy quick reference Spanish grammar book alphabetically arranged that tackles queries that don't require much explanation. This book cannot be used to learn Spanish however, I would say it serves as a reference for advanced students and teachers. It does not cover all grammar topics and definitely not any complex structures but can definitely act as a handy resource if you are looking to clarify a doubt or if you are in the middle of writing a composition or an essay in Spanish thus not having to consult a text book and search through several chapters and grammar points to hopefully address the one or few queries that you have. As an educator of the Spanish language, I did find it handy because whenever I had a query that can be researched in Bscalo I was able to find what I was looking for within seconds. Some examples of the grammar concepts that the book covers are: verb conjugations, moods- indicative, imperative, subjunctive and their usage, prepositions- por, para, a, de , en etc. , the usage of "hay", "hubo", numbers, pronouns of all kinds (subject, prepositional, reflexive), verbs-reflexive vs. non-reflexive, the usage of "gustar" and like verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs. The purpose of the book is to clarify key grammar concepts and the most problematic ones without going into depth on the subject matter. If you are an advanced student, be it high-school or university level, a native speaker or an educator of Spanish, "Bscalo" will prove beneficial to you for quick, hands on clarifications. This is a reliable and worthy reference material for those who want to maintain grammatically correct usage when speaking or writing in the Spanish language.
