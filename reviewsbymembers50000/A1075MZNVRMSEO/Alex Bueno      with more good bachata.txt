 I was quite surprised when I discovered that Alex Bueno had a new release. Without hesitation I purchased the cd knowing that it would be an excellent production. Well, I think "Pideme" confirms Alex Bueno's talent as a bachata artist. This is his third album in this genre and the only thing I could say is that he keeps getting better. I think this one however should be deemed as his best bachata album although all his productions are wonderful. The songs have romantic and genuine lyrics, danceable and most of all they are sentimental. As always Alex sings from his soul thus making his bachata touch the hearts of his listeners. If you already own his two previous bachata albums "Bachata a su tiempo" and "Corazon Duro", don' hesitate to buy this one. Alex continues to deliver high quality and I reassure you, you will like this new bachata. Do enjoy!
