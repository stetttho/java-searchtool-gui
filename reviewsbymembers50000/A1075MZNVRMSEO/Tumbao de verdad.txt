 (...)As expected this cd is a fantastic production by our lady of salsa. The title alone is indicative of what is to be expected and believe me Celia did not disappoint. This album is full "tumbao"- cuban tumbao. It is a continuation of the new style salsa that Celia initiated in her previous production. This cd is full of energy, musical creativity and rhythms that represent the essence of cuban salsa that has roots in afro-caribbean music out from which other equally beautiful cuban rhythms have derived such as guaguanco, cha-cha-cha, guaracha and charanga. "La Negra tiene tumbao" in particular is a very lively production thanks to the lyrics that deal with life themes in a humorous way and the professional musical orquestration by Celia's musicians. No doubt about it, this album was made for those who understand the meaning of  "musica criolla" and "el sonido cubano". Celia did not earn her title "la reina de la salsa" by chance, once again she has risen to the top and has shown the world that she will forever be guarachando. This cd is a musical gem- "with a lot of tumbao".
