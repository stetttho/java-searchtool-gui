 This reference- Mujer-diferente desde el principio- is a mini guide to women's issues as they relate to physical and mental health. The guide is quite informative and does explain the root cause of many diseases that affect women and offer suggestions on how women can help themselves and how your doctor can also play a vital role in the recovery process. I found the section on sexually transmitted diseases, breast cancer and menopause quite detailed and helpful as every women's body is different thus each one's experiences are different as well. The book is quite an easy read and not over burdened with medical terminology that is difficult to understand but at the same time proper medical terminology is used throughout the book. The book emphasizes the necessity to recognize symptoms in all stages in our lives since our body changes as we get older and the key to successfully overcoming some illness is detecting them and arresting them as early as possible.
