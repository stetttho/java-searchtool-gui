 This is a great compilation cd of the best of tropical music-Salsa and Merengue in year 2000. The songs on the cd were most likely chosen based on market popularity and surely enough the compilation is excellent. I browsed at the line up of songs prior to making the purchase and I instantly new that I had a gem in my hands just waiting to be played. If you are an avid fan of Salsa and Merengue you will definitely recognize all the songs and if you are new to both genres, I am quite sure you will be impressed with the selection. The cd has cuts from some of the modern greats of tropical music such as Son by 4, Eddy Herrera, Huey Dunbar and many more. This is the kind of cd that can be played through and through and also the music will inspire you to dance wherever you are. No regrets here. I highly recommend this lively compilation cd.
