 Well, if you were not convinced of their talent displayed in "Hoja en Blanco" this album will surely erase any lingering doubts. In a short period time Monchy & Alexandra have risen to the top and their bachata is definitely in a class by itself. Their singing capability has always been strong and "Confesiones" has melodic, sentimental and passionate bachatas that are sung by this duet who has proven their talent as bachata singers. This album is complete with romantic bachatas but yet are very lively with upbeat rhythms. All the songs are great but you will definitely notice that "Te Quiero Igual que Ayer", "Dos Locos" , "Polo Opuesto", "Cuando no Se Puede Olvidar" and "En un Dos Por Tres" are show-stoppers . In a nutshell this is a great bachata album and a five star rating simply is not enough!
