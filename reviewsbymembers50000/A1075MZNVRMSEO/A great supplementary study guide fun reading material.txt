 Any additional reading material other than a text book is always helpful when studying a language. Idiomatic expressions always present difficulties or challenges especially if they cannot  be translated word for word. The objective of this book is to provide the reader with an explanation of the meaning and an example of how some common idioms are used in the Spanish language. I found that the book is well organized, divided alphabetically, concise and covers a broad range of examples non specific to a country, region or group of Spanish speakers. Once again NTC Publishing Group has provided readers and learners of Spanish with a useful and handy reference that can definitely enrich one's knowledge and understanding of Spanish either written or spoken. Here are some examples of the range of idioms that are outlined in the book: 1) de hecho = in fact (cannot be translated literally) 2) sin embargo = however (cannot be translated literally) 3) a primera vista= at first sight (common, everyday expression. Easy to understand) 4) dar la lata = to make a nuisance of oneself ( cannot be translated word for word, common expression) 5) tener mala pata= to have bad luck (common everyday expression) This book not only contains idioms but everyday short frases that sometimes are hard to express correctly if one has not learned the correct way or has not heard it used prior. An example of this would be #1 and #2 above. These types of short frases are important because they are of everyday usage and the more one knows the more authentic the Spanish will sound. If you are looking to enrich your Spanish regardless of your current level, this book will definitely be of great help and will broaden your overall knowledge and understanding of the language.
