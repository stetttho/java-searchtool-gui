 This magazine is wonderful if you are looking for a magazine that is easy to read, entertaining and yet informative all in one. It is geared toward the Latin community but I think it could also interest anyone who speaks Spanish and has a love for the culture. I started buying this magazine regularly in 1998 and I am still a fan of People en espanol. At first glance one may think that it's the Spanish version the weekly People magazine in English but believe me the only element in common is the title. This magazine has a section on "la farndula" and "en familia" which I find always nice to read and sometimes there are good articles about infants and kids that give helpful tips about childcare. There are other informative sections that you can read according to your personal preference. Lastly, the quality of the Spanish is very good in comparison to other magazines in its class in which I have found major grammar errors on a regular basis. This magazine is worth every cent and can be read through an through.
