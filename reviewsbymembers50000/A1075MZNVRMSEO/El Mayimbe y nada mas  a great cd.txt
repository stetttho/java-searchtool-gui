 This is another great production by Antony Santos in fact it's one of my favorites from his earlier productions. Antony Santos- el Mayimbe is in form in this cd and he continues with his amargue style that has made him so popular with followers of bachata music over the years. There is not much else that I can say except for if you like Antony Santos' bachata this album is another nice one for your "bachatu collection". I tend to focus on the bachatas only and rest assured they are all terrific. The only downfall of the cd is the sound quality. The recording sound seems unusually low. Therefore be prepared to turn up the volume quite  a bit to get the best sound. Otherwise enjoy El Mayimbe y nada mas.
