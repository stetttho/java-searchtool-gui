 This cd is a gem. I purchased it many years ago well aware that the cd was full of old original cumbia songs but some of the greatest in my opinion and definitely well be cheerished by true fans of this unique genre. It has some of Colombia's finest groups who have perfected this rhythm and by listening to it really does take you to point in time that only most of us can imagine but I am sure holds beautiful memories for those who grew up in Colombia when these songs were popular. The only downfall of this cd is it's too short but it is a nice a compilation for those who are fans of authentic cumbia. You will certainly recognize classic songs such as: Tabaco y Ron, Amaneciendo, Se me perdio la cadenita, El pescador de Baru among others. This is a gem of a cd.
