 This is a terrific sounding cd by los Titanes de Colombia but somewhat mellow considering they can really let loose and produce some fierce salsa if necessary. The pace is quite up beat and the songs are all danceable except for the first one only because it sounds very slow in comparison to the other songs. I like all the them and especially songs #6-10. The style is a cross between salsa (Colombian style) and  hints of son montuno in some of the songs.  The musicality and instrumentation are all excellent but then again how could it not sound great since Diego Gale is the top percusionist. If you like los Titanes go ahead and try this new production you will enjoy it (to what degree I leave that up to you). What really surprised me is  since they are from Colombia and are competing with premier groups such Fruko y sus Tesos, Sonora Carruseles and Grupo Gale, I expected more of a powerful and impacting salsa album similar to their production "Salsa al Maximo Volataje" but never the less a good album worthy of recognition. This album is similar to the style of Los Nemus del Pacifico also Colombian but their primary rhythm is Son Montuno. Good album. Don't be afraid to try it.
