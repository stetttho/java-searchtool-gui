 I purchased this bachata compilation cd in 1997 not expecting that it would have so many top hits and nightclub favourites. I could assure you that this cd is a treasure as it contains sixteen of the most popular bachatas in 1996 and they still are played today on the radio, in nightclubs and listened to by many bachata fans surely enough. The compilation is almost a perfect selection of bachatas especially the first eight songs. The big hits in this compilation cd are: Amores extranos, Piensa en mi, Si algun dia la ves, El verde de tus ojos (the original version by Kiko Rodriguez) & Si supiera. The cd has a mix of danceable bachatas and slower ones for your listening pleasure. Don't miss out on this album. The title is " Super Bachatazos 96" but these are super bachatazos "for life".
