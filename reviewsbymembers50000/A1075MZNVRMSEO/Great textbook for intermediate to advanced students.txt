 I purchased this textbook 2 years ago because it looked interesting and informative and as Spanish language educator, I believe it is important to keep abreast of the lastest educative material on the market. Not only was I pleased with the content and the grammar topics covered in the book but I was particularly impressed with the cultural awareness themes in every chapter, the thorough explanation of the grammar concepts and the opportunity to prepare and discuss controversial themes in Spanish thus allowing to student to develop his/her vocabulary and speaking skills. This edition of Conexiones is a complete course for intermediate to advanced Spanish students and if studied thoroughly, to completion with a competent instructor, the student will have and above average foundation in Spanish which would be beneficial to his/her future studies in the Spanish language. I strongly recommend this textbook to teachers and students pursuing advanced knowledge in Spanish.
