 This is an excellent resource for those who are using the Spanish language in a professional capacity. I would strongly recommend it to teachers, translators, interpreters and writers. Advanced students in Spanish would also find this dictionary helpful. This dictionary is monolingual-Spanish only and it provides a wide range of synonyms and antonyms of the selected words with examples as necessary to show subtle differences in meaning especially when there is a very fine line between which word is more adequate. A good example of this is the word "narrow". In Spanish you will find "estrecho" and "angosto" however, with very subtle differences not to be used interchangeably. Most dictionaries don't make the distinction. This one does and this concept is very important when using the language at a high level. Another great example is the word "beautiful" in Spanish there are many equivalents such as "hermoso", "bello", "lindo" etc. but all with very specific nuances, which need to be taken into consideration when using the words. Since having purchased this dictionary three years ago, I find it to be a valuable resource. If you are an advanced student or a Spanish professional this dictionary will prove to be beneficial.
