 This is a very reliable all purpose dictionary that has approximately 110.000 entries and very up-to-date vocabulary of technology. I found this dictionary in my campus bookstore and immediately recognized that it was a quality reference. It is comparable to the Larousse version that's in circulation. The dictionary also has two helpful appendixes. The first one has sample letters of all themes and sample phrases of different scenarios. The second appendix has a range of grammatical concepts that are usually an area of concern for students. The font is just the right size and there are many examples provided of word usage and idiomatic expressions. This is the perfect dictionary for intermediate to advanced level students. The Spanish is quite diverse with Spain and Latin American terminology. This is a very complete academic dictionary at an economical price.
