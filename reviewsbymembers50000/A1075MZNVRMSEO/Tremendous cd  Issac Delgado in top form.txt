 In my opinion this album is a return to form. Meaning this is the style of son (afro) cubano for which Issac Delgado has become so famous. I struggled with his previous release "La Formula" so I was a bit hesitant to buy this one but I let the past speak for itself and decided to buy it. Surely enough Issac is back in form. I love every inch of this cd. The percussion, acoustics, and musical arrangements are exemplary and if you are a son cubano aficionado you will recognize the caliber of music that has been put together by Issac. All the songs are wonderful but I was especially taken aback by- #1 Corazon Corazon, #5 Orden del dia and #8 Identidad. It is great to evidence such quality music of this genre son since salsa today has dominated the market and really it all began with "son". As well in terms of Issac he is an example of very few artists who make it to the top and remain there. This is a highly recommended cd.
