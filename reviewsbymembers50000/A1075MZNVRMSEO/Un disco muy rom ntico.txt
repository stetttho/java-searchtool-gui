 As expected "Amor en silencio" is a great production with all the trimmings. Frank Reyes is at his highest point with the style of bachata that he sings and is one of the best singers "bachateros" of this musical category. This cd in particular is a fine example of beauty and all the songs are a wonderful display of Frank's talent. If it possible to say, this is his best album yet but that what I thought when I listened to his two previous recordings. All I can say is that if you are a fan of romantic bachata and can appreciate a soft and sincere voice, don't hesistate any longer. This cd will meet all of your expectations. Other recommended productions: "Vine a decirte adis", "Extrao mi pueblo". A five star rating simply is not enough!
