 This album by Victor Manuelle is throw back to 60's / 70's sonero style salsa that became so popular in New York in those years. It has the flavor of yesteryear with some acoustics and musical arrangements of today's salsa nuances. Right from the start the album was convincing and right through to the end the album kept delivering a high standard of songs which is so characteristic of Victor Manuelle.This is definitely a different style by the "sonero" who has paved a convincing career path over the years. However, this salsa is in a class by itself. There is no other album of his to compare it to. It's very unique and truly outstanding. Give it try....y no tienes que preguntarle a luna. This is a wonderful album indeed!
