 This is a sharp album by Pochy y su Cocoband. It is definitely for loyal fans and for those who have not lost faith in the genre. I was not aware of this new release but I did not hesitate to buy it when I was scouting for new cds. This is typical Pochy album with hard hitting beats, hilarious lyrics about everyday life and rhythms that will make you do only one thing-bailar. Once you buy it you will notice that this is the Pochy of old that made this band so popular in the 90's. The album has 12 tracks and they are 12 great merengues. My favorites are: #1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9. This is a Pochy y su Cocoband hall of fame album. Check it out!
