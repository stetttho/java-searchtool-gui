 This album by Rey Ruiz is a reflection of sheer talent as a musical artist. I always believed and still do that his talent is exceptional however, he is extremely underrated and overshadowed by other salsa artists in his category. For example Jerry Rivera & Victor Manuelle. All have similar styles and elements in common however, Jerry R and Victor M had better promotions which enabled them to rise to the top. This album has salsas that are typical of Rey's style. They are slow paced, melodic,well sung and have sentimental lyrics. All the songs are delightful and the album invites you to sit back and listen to the essence of good romantic salsa. Although all the songs are excellent I must make mention of "Mal momento", "Quien lo diria" and "Si te preguntan" which are my favorites. If you like Rey Ruiz, try this album because they come like this anymore.
