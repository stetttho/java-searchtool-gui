 This textbook is a gem if your desire is to review complex grammatical structures in Spanish only with thorough explanations and examples. I purchased this text many years ago from a university bookstore that I was visiting and immediately purchased it after browsing through some of chapters. The grammar review is complete with practice exercises and an answer key at the back of the book. The reading sections are interesting themes. Some writings are from famous Latin-American poets and authors. The reading sections also have comprehension exercises and vocabulary building sections. The textbook is ideal for advanced students who wish to review concepts that have already been studied and would be a suitable textbook for Intermediate students who wish to advance to the next level in their studies. Keep in mind the grammar topics are not exhaustive but covers traditionally difficult concepts in ten chapters. This text will surely clarify many common grammatical doubts for advance speakers and present some new concepts to Intermediate students.
