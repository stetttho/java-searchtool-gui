 This bachata is sweet, pure and romantic. I discovered Allendi in 2001 in the DR and without even hearing music from him previously I decided to give the album a try. I don't know what it was but the cover attracted me. The album is now in my exclusive favorites collection. His bachata has an oldies feel to it, the rhythms and acoustics are classic which gives this bachata a yesteryear feel and sound.  Allendi's voice is quite strong; actually you would think he's older because his voice sounds so strong and the lyrics are wonderful. They tell a true story. He definitely has a future ahead of him but probably needs more exposure because he's not being marketed outside the Dominican Republic (as far as I know). I like all the bachatas but the ones that always get played repeatedly when I listen to the album are: Te mal informaron, Amor traicionero and Mal de amor. If you like meaningful and romantic bachata this album should be a part of your bachata collection.
