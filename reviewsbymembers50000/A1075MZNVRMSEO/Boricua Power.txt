 Every musical artist has a remarkable album in his/her repertoire, the one that stands out from the others, the one that is an instant "hit"and I dare to say that "Libre" is the album that is platinum in Marc Anthony's collection. I trust that most people will be able to recognize and appreciate the manifestation of several different latin rhythms that have been masterfully orquestrated to produce such exceptional music. The genre here is clearly salsa but there are hints of other latin rhythmical sounds such as: vallenato, cha-cha-cha and afrocaribbean mixtures. Marc Anthony has exercised his musical creativity to his utmost potential and out from this unique talent has produced a musical masterpiece. All the songs are worthy of the highest praise for their lyrics and acoustics. Also amazingly enough all are incredibly danceable. I must make mention of one song "De qu depende" because it is the best example of how latin rhythms can successfully be combined while the distinction of each rhythm is still heard. I reiterate this is a superb production and it should be in the collection of all salsa lovers! Que vivan Puerto Rico y el poder borrinqueo....!
