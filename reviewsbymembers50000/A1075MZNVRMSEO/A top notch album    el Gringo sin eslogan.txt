 El Gringo de la Bachata has to be one of most overlooked bachata artists of today, which is a shame because his music is unique, genuine and downright good. He does not have any productions that are platinum but does not have a bad one either. However, I must say this production is notably different in that the rhythms are more upbeat and the sound of the guitar is really impressive which is the essence of bachata music. The song that made it to the top on this album is Gringo Muere de Dolor but without an inch of exaggeration all the bachatas are superb. Since I truly listen to bachata I can confirm that the lyrics are sentimental which is also typical of El Gringo. Ramon Galvez-El Gringo is definitely showing us a new face and his bachata is now in a class by itself. Anything less than a five star rating on this album would be unjust!
