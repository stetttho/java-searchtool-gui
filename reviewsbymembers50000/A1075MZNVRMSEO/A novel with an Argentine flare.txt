 Por Pasiones Asi is a most interesting book and it is the first time that I am sampling this author's work. I bought the book based on the synopsis on the back cover and the publishing house Seix Barral is very renowned so I was confident with my purchase. The protagonist of the book a Spaniard gets a one-year assignment as a journalist in Argentina. Among his many endeavors he meets an exotic dancer and they become passionately involved. Their relationship evolves throughout the book but it is not really based on anything real. We also get a taste of the clashes between the Spanish and Latin American culture as well as the Spanish and Argentinean culture. Also we learn about the differences between the Argentinean elite and the non-elite. Andres Sebastian, the protagonist is covering stories in Argentina during a very turbulent time in its history. Basically a period of economic and political instability but is unable to really come up with a big story. The book is interesting from a political and social point of view and may have a special interest to those who know about Argentina's modern economic and political history. Lots of colloquial dialogue also the Spanish spoken is typical Argentinean Spanish throughout the book.
