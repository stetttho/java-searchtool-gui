 This book is the story of the author's memory of her mother's life and also a tribute to all the wonderful memories from childhood to womanhood that Soledad Puertolas shared with her mother. I found it very easy to relate to and very sentimental since many females have and have had at one point in their life a close relationship with their mom. The memories are based on her life in Madrid when Soledad was a child and then eventually married and had her own children at which time her mother played an integral role in the life of her children as a grandparent. The book to me serves as a reminder to all of us of the importance of familiar relationships and that nothing last forever. Important people in our life need to be appreciated and oddly enough we sometimes only realize that when we become older or when they are gone... forever. This was a nice read and a pleasant reminder.
