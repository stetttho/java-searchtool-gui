 They call themselves Adolescent's Orquesta but their talent is anything but adolescent. This album is their second production and there is no trace of sophomore jinx. If anything this album over powers the first one, which was quite good as well. All I can say is that if you truly consider yourself a salsa lover and dancer put on your dancing shoes because every track will have you moving. This is some high-energy romantic salsa with original nuances that this group his patented as their own. This salsa is truly delicious and is a new voice for Venezuela. Hopefully they will carry on the tradition of salsa as more renowned artists from their country such as Oscar D'Leon phase out and become less mainstream. Every song on this album is great but I must mention some of my favourites which are: Persona ideal, Arrepentida, and Clase social. This is a great album not to be missed by true salsa lovers.
