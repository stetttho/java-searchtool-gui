 This album by Antony Santos has some sweet controversy surrounding it. Meaning the hit song "Pegame tu vicio" which was included on the first set of releases of this album but going forward was removed and replaced with a merengue. So caution to those of you are looking for this beautiful bachata, you may find one album in a store somewhere that has it but if you didn't buy it shortly after the album was released good luck.   The album is a typical Antony Santos recording. In my humble opinion, this guy is a great bachatero but overloads his albums with merengues that don't enhance the cd. That's the issue I have with this album too. The five bachatas are great and then the rest of the album has merengues and a balad. Those who did not get the version that I have with "Pegame tu vicio" will only have four bachatas. If you like Antony Santos and want to keep collecting his productions it's a worthy purchase. Once again the bachatas are phenomenal which makes it all worthwhile.
