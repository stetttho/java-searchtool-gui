 Alex Bueno seems to have mastered the art of singing bacahta in a short period of time. This is his second album and it's a hit without a doubt. All the songs are danceable, enjoyable, rhythmic and have sentimental lyrics. I also liked Alex's musical arrangements in bachata they seem to be very unique while maintaining the essence of bachata rhythms. This album will definitely please anyone who is a follower of this music or is new to this genre. I promise you if you buy it you will enjoy it throroughly. My cheerised songs on this album are: "No te descuides", 'Que vuelva" y "Me ire". This is a great bachata cd for all bachata followers.
