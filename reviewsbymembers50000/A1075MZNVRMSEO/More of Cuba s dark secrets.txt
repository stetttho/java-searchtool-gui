 This is the first book I have ever read on this subject matter; Cuban jails and the inhumane treatment towards its prisoners. In this book the victims of mistreatment are females. The experience of these severely ill-treated revolutionary prisoners is mind boggling and once again makes one question the value of "human rights" in a country where humanitarian rights of any kind are not respected. The title is a reflection of the main theme of the book "Dios en las carceles cubanas" directly refers to never ending praying and spiritual presence of God in the jails as their only hope for survival. The protagonist Ana (in the first part of the book) is secretly holding religious gatherings in the jail which is completely forbidden and against the rules. These victims resort to God and the African spirits as a means of survival and a hope for the future. This book is the testimony of several female Revolutionary prisoners who describe only what I can imagine to be only a part of the torture that they suffered for many years and some did not live to tell their stories. Once again this is an aspect of Cuba that is kept in the closet that many outsiders do not see, know or hear about. The Cuban population needs to be liberated. That's my only hope and hopefully it will be soon.
