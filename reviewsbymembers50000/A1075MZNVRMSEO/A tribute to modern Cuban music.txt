 Mi Tierra is such a special, sincere, romantic and most of all a very Cuban album. In the market now for 10 years and still has its musical magic comparable to the first time that I listened to this production. No doubt this is one of her most complete albums and perhaps her best in the category of tropical music. Gloria Estefan has always been a renowned singer in English and if I am not mistaken Mi Tierra is her first Spanish album and who would of thought that it would be so successful. This cd has various Cuban rhythms like son, traditional, boleros and salsa. The album has 12 songs in total and they are all wonderful. Once you start listening to the album there will be no need to stop. The first song will really coax you into listening to the rest of the recording. It's a very romantic bolero and at the same time very inspiring and well sung by Gloria which will leave you motivated to listen to the rest of the songs. There are very danceable ones such as the forever popular "Mi Tierra" as well as 'Ayer" and "Hablemos el mismo idioma". Mi Tierra is one of those albums that has no time frame because the songs will live forever and this music has no boundaries. It's for anyone who knows how to appreciate the beauty that it has to offer. I hope Gloria produces more Spanish albums. I think she was born to sing in her native language! Try to ascertain a copy while you can. This is wonderful tribute to Spanish music, people and culture! Arriba Cuba!
