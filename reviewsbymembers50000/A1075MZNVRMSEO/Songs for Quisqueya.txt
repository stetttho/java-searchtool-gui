 This album by Fernando Villalona confirms what true merengue lovers always knew: merengue is from the Dominican Republic (Quisqueya la Bella). I knew immediately after listening to it that it was something very special and unique and that Fernando is back again to give Dominicans and fans all around the world merengue which is a fine display of its origins. This music is distinct with nuances typical of Villalona's style but at the same time he incorporated new elements thus making this merengue danceable and most of all contagious. "Mal acostumbrado" is a very complete album with different genres of merengue and as usual it contains some romantic ballads with Caribbean rhythms that have become a trademark of Fernando's ballads. Easily many of these merengues can dominate the "hit parade" like Mal acostumbrado, Profeta en su tierra, Jamas me marchare and Mis amaneceres and a few others. Once again this merengue sounds wonderful and is wonderful. Also, it is danceable and very sentimental too! Please do buy it and enjoy it! This is great romantic merengue.
