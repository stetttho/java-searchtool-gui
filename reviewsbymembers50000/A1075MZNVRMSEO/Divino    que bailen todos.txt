 I never doubted that this cd would be superb but I will admit when I purchased it I was familiar with most of the artists but not the songs. Therefore, I left everything up to chance and believe me what a nice surprise Merenhits 2003 has turned out to be. This is a well-blended cd with various styles of merengue from both Dominican and Puerto Rican artists. In this edition there's a little of everything. It has the commercial merengues like "Besame tu boca" by Elvis Crespo and "Como ayer" by Anthony. Romantic merengues by Eddy Herrera "El idiota" and "Ahora vete "Alex Bueno". Hard hitting merengues (golpeito total) from Kinito Mendez "Tirame tu que yo te devuelvo" and La Makina "Celosa" (an absolute treat!) Lastly, an unexpected track which is a nice" merengue tipico" by Geovanny Polanco "Con el agua y el javon". If you like merengue you must possess this edition as it has a great line up of songs. If you like to dance guaranteed you will be dancing or if you like to just listen to great merengue this cd will satisfy your needs. Overall it is worth your patronage. The only song that seems quite out of place is "Meniando la Pera" by Magic Juan. Other than that this cd is divine! Other great compilation cds by J& N records are: Merenhits 2001,2002. Bachata hits 2001,2002,2003.
