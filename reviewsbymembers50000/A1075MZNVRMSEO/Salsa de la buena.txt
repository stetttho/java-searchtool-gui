 When I bought this album I had never heard of Pedro Jess, in fact I stumbled upon this album because it was misplaced in the Jazz section when I was browsing through the new albums on display at Best Buy. I immediately decided to buy it, I figured it was produced by a reliable record label- Musical Productions which is the record company of many other great salsa artists such as Tito Rojas, Tito Gmez, Anthony Cruz, Hector Rey, Mimi Ibarra among other greats. Well, I was not disappointed the album surpassed my expectations. This salsa is authentic, Pedro Jesus' voice is outstanding and the musical arrangements are of top quality, no doubt about it there some experienced musicians in his orchestra. All the salsas are danceable, upbeat and can definitely can be enjoyed by salsa connoisseurs or by those who are sampling this genre of music for the first time.  This is also great salsa for listening in a relaxing setting. High recommendation given for this album by Pedro Jes
