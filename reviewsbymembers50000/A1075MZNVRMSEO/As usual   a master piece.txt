 Don't hesitate to purchase this album from Kinito Mendez. It's full of the kind merengue that makes him one of the most popular merengue artists of today attracting fans of all ages. This merengue has a little of everything. It contains great beats, some faster tempos, comical lyrics and unique rhythms. This is one of my favourite albums from Kinito Mendez because of the lyrics that narrate true life stories in a humorous and unique way that only Kinito does best. There are several show stoppers tunes in this album such as: Pegue, Anja Juan, Cachamba, Grua and Que raro. Get ready to laugh because that is what this album will inspire you to do when you start dancing to this contagious merengue and if you don't understand Spanish consider buying a dictionary because you'll be missing out on the essence of this album. With merengue like this Kinito is going only in one direction... straight to the top. Enjoy...este merengue de loco!
