 El General has a unique style when it comes to the genre of music that he creates. Mostly Spanish reggae but has produced songs that have predominantly other tropical rhythms. I am not a fan of his music however, I tend to like songs here and there. Basically, I like a song as I hear it. This album really caught my attention because there were several songs that I thought would be nice to listen to from time to time so I took a chance on the album. It's pretty good. The rhythms vary not all are reggae. If you are familiar with his style then I think you know what to expect. His music usually has one objective: to make you move. I especially like Mecedora and Mariachi Loco. Quite a good album. I just have to get used to it.
