 This is a new release by McGraw-Hill and is a very handy resource that offers a wealth of definitions and clarification of usage of everyday colloquialisms, slang, vulgarity and their meaning. When I saw the book in the store I was a bit hesitant to purchase it because of the price but I quickly realized that the price was incomparable to wealth of information offered. It's obvious that there was a considerable amount of time and research spent in order to produce this handy tool and I do believe it would most benefit those who are natives of Spanish, advanced students, professionals, journalists, translators, interpreters and writers. This dictionary would be overwhelming for a beginner as it is written in Spanish and the vocabulary used in the definitions and examples is advanced at times. The only flaw in this reference is does not give the country or countries where a typical expression may be used which I think is very valuable because what may be a friendly word or expression in one country may be totally offensive in another. Here are some examples of expressions detailed in this dictionary: 1.chochete- mujer joven (a young woman). This was new to me. I would say "jovencita" or "doncella". 2.en cuerpo y alma- plenamente, completamente (completely) This is an everyday expression in the Spanish language. 3.mala leche - mala suerte (bad luck) (Everyday expression). 4.curichi- avaro, tacao (greedy)  5.meter la gamba - equivocarse (to make a mistake) I would say "meter la pata". These are just some examples I selected at random and #4 , # 5 are new to me. I know the generic expressions but not the slang, which is valuable, and somewhere down the road I may come across these expressions. As mentioned above this resource is priceless and it will broaden your scope and understanding of everyday Spanish and aid you with correct usage.This is money well spent!
