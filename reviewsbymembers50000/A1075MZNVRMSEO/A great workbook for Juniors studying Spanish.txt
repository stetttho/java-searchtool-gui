 This is a wonderful workbook for a wide variety of students. It can be used in conjunction with the text or alone as a supplementary study aid. The level is definitely for a beginner or for those who wish to teach their children Spanish in the home. The learning approach is extremely user friendly with plenty of pictures, short but beneficial practice exercises, a vocabulary builder section and many question and answer opportunities. There is some grammar taught but it is not the focus of the workbook. There is also a focus on reading and expressing one's ideas using the vocabulary taught in the chapters. This workbook is definitely geared towards a junior audience, grades 3-6 and can be used in the classroom or at home. With proper instruction and dedication the young Spanish student will increase his/ her reading, writing and speaking skills in Spanish. An important note there is no answer key provided however, there is a glossary at the back of the workbook.
