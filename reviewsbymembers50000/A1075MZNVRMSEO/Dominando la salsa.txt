 Well everyone here you have the latest cd by la Sonora Carruseles and it is no surprise that it is really superb. They continue with their style known as salsa-boogaloo, which dominated in their two previous albums- Heavy Salsa "and" Con todos los Hierros, and now they are definitely reigning in this category. The salsa in this cd is danceable, rhythmic, lively and once again they have combined various tropical rhythms such as charanga, pachanga and the 60's style salsa with strong sounds of the percussion and drums, two elements which separate their salsa from other groups. La Sonora Carruseles uses different nuances to create their music and in fact these nuances distinguish and liven up their sound. This cd has been made sparing no expense and the only thing you have to is buy it and enjoy it as the title states "de una vez".
