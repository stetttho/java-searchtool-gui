 This cd is an enjoyable tropical music compilation. In terms of variety most of songs are the popular hits of the 90's in salsa, merengue and cumbia. This cd is definitely a party starter and will be enjoyed by those who want to go back in time and even newcomers to any of the three genres will get a good feel for what each style is all about. Most of the artists are Dominican. El macho (cumbia) by Lisandro Meza for sure is a Colombian artist. This cd includes some of the finest. For example: Cocoband (Pochy Familia), Fernando Villalona, Cuco Valoy and Dimanchy. These are artists had their fair share of popularity. I think styles and preferences have changed that is why they are not as popular today. But this cd should be in your collection just to enjoy, dance and reminisce. This kind of tropical music is becoming a rare find. The key hits are: Salsa con coco, Gran Fieston, Ojo por Ojo, Feliz cumbe/ Carnaval and El macho.
