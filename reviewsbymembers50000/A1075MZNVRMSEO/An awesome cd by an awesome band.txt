 Okay even if I wanted to give this cd four stars I can't do it. This band is truly Indetenible as Hector Acosta says and it's so true. This cd is typical Toros Band music. This is a caravana de merengue para el buen gusto. It has every genre of merengue- fast pace, slow, traditional style-cibaeno, merengue tipico and one bachata. These guys are really strong and are keeping merengue a unique rhythm that it is and are not falling into the commercial style same beat sound that most merengues groups produce today. The presence of the Los Toros Band keeps Dominican merengue strong and respected. This is a great cd. I hope you enjoy it!
