 This group is on a role. This album is the third of latest three that represent the new, energetic, upbeat, PR style merengue by Limi-t 21. They are really "el grupo del pueblo" as they state in their intro. This kind of merengue will definitely get you moving if you are looking for "dance merengue" and even more so if you see them perform live. The new Limit-21 definitely has their act together and if you wish to sample more of this style of theirs, just check out their two previous albums: "Sabe a Limi-t" and "Calle sabor, esquina, amor". You won't regret this purchase. Give it a try... porque sabe a Limi-t!
