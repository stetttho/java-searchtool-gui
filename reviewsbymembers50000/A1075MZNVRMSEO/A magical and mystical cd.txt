 This is the first cd by the now well-know series Aqui esta la bachata. This cd has bachata songs from the best of the best and now after many years have become internationalized and popular among bachata fans everywhere. I have classified this album as magical and mystical because of the ambience that is created when listening to this cd. The bachatas are of the genre "bachata tropical" but also are very romantic and traditional in style which makes you reminisce about the past and situates you in a very specific place in time that hopefully brings good memories. The cd was well compiled by Pl?tano Records with original hits from some of best artists today and as well what makes a series such as Aqui esta la bachata always intriguing is that many of the best bachateros are under the Platano Record label therefore the best of the best are on stage at the same time. The album is enriched with some classics such as: Corazon Bonito, Si tu carino no esta, Nereyda and Voy pa'lla. If you have never heard bachata before this album would definitely be a good start and intro to this unique rhythm from the Dominican Republic that has taken many years to become accepted and popular both locally and around the world but as the title states "Aqui esta la bachata"and it's here to stay !
