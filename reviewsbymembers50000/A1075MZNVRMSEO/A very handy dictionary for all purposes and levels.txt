 This is a wonderful dictionary if you are looking for clear and concise definitions of words in Spanish. The dictionary is unilingual, Spanish only and is defined as a diccionario "escolar" which usually means for grade school which in North America would be equivalent to grades 6-8 maybe even beyond. The dictionary has 20,000 definitions approximately with synonyms provided for most words and pictures of the nouns where applicable. The dictionary also has verb charts of irregular verbs in various tenses which are located randomly throughout the dictionary. Along with the definitions and synonyms an example of the word in a phrase is also provided which really clarifies the meaning of the word if the reader still has doubts. Although it's considered a junior dictionary, I think it's an all purpose dictionary especially since it is unilingual and provides a broad range of terms that can help anyone in search of a word that is part of everyday speech in Spanish and not a colloquialism or a regional terminology. It is definitely a handy reference for native speakers and bilingual students. The dictionary is worth every penny.
