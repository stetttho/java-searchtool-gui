 This release from Jossie Esteban is one my favorites from this exceptionally talented merengue artist. Formally the lead singer of La Patrulla 15, as a soloist artist for many years now Jossie is in his element. This album follows his classic high energy, upbeat and extremely rhythmic merengue. The lyrics are hilarious as usual which will inspire you to dance and enjoy every inch of each song. This album has plenty of hits to choose from. My personal favorites are: "El baile del Pato", "Borrachao y Sigo Para'o", "Gozando", "Nadie" and "Solo,Solo'. If you like Jossie Esteban then you know what to expect. He does not disappoint. Therefore don't miss out on this wonderful album.
