 Orquesta Guaycan is one Colombia's premier salsa groups that began in the eighties and emerged in the nineties on a more international scale. Their productions are usually strong and typical of the Colombian salsa trade mark.  Meaning fast rhythms, plenty of percussion and extremely up beat. This production is a long awaited once since their last album "De nuevo en la salsa" that was released in 1999. This one Ayer Hoy y Siempre is very promising as they reintegrate themselves back into the salsa world while competing against their Colombian counterparts such as: Grupo Gale, Grupo Niche, Fruko and Sonora Carruseles. The album is quite good with mostly fast salsas that will definitely liven up any party Guayacan style. I saw the album, bought it without hesitation and I am enjoying it thoroughly. It will definitely catch the attention of true salsa lovers and those who enjoy Colombian salsa. I like this album much more than the previous one as mentioned above mostly because it is full of pure salsa rhythms and not fusions with other tropical beats that is so common in tropical music today. Overall this is a solid production!
