 Los Chiches Vallenatos are one of Colombia's premier vallenato groups and a fine representative of this genre of music exclusive to Colombia. They have quite the repertoire and talent which is displayed in many albums however, this one, Mas Romanticos is one of my favorites. With top notch acoustics and heart felt lyrics this vallenato is very sentimental. This album can be listened to from start to finish since this cd has a fine collection of songs. If you don't have music from los Chiches this album would be a nice debut, it's pure vallenato rhythmically and acoustically. Some of the exceptional pieces are: Mi primer amor, Por favor escuchame, De nia a mujer and Princesita inmortal. Songs # 2 & #6 are just truly awesome.
