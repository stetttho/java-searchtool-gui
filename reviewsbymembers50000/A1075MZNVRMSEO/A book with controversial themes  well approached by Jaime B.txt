  No se lo digas a nadie deals with what is considered still a very controversial topic in most Latin American societies. Jaime Bayly explores the world of homosexuality and the reactions by the society in which one lives and the reader gets a taste of how people react, scorn, and alienate etc. homosexual and gay culture. The reader gets a picture of how the theme is dealt with in Lima, Peru but I think the reactions of people would be similar in other Latin cultures.  Joaquin, the protagonist struggles against traditional values, his father's machismo while he discovers his own homosexual tendencies. Also, we learn that the protagonist is drug addict- cocaine in Peru is not that difficult to ascertain. This book is worth the read if you want to explore the many themes that are revealed by Jaime Bayly in the book: homosexuality, drug addiction, and the presence of machismo in the Latin culture. The language is strong but it goes hand and hand with the theme of the book.
