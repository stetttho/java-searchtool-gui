 This is a very illustrative book for adolescent's (even adults) that provides essential information about a very normal process of life- going from childhood, to adolescence to adulthood. Young teens have questions, many of the answers they ascertain are from a wrong source or one that gives partial information. The book however clarifies many questions in a plain and fun to read way which is the type of language that a young teenager may appreciate. Chances are anything too complicated will not be read but it is light in tone but accurate in detail which I find makes it ideal for young males and females to read. I read the Spanish version which is a translated version of English (Que pasa alli abajo) and I found it quite enlightening and could easily be understand. The way the information is presented is valuable for the target audience. Teens need to know and understand their corporal changes, know the implications of  early intimate relations, STDs etc. In the day and age in which we live kids increasingly have more exposure to these themes at an early age and it is important that they get correct information and not a fabricated version from their peers. As a parent you may want to read the book and then decide if it's adequate for your teens. I thought it was superb for the target audience.
