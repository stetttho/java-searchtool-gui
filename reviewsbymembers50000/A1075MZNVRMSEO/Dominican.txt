 Azucarado is a tremendous Dominican group with a genuine merengue rhythm that's upbeat, fast paced, catchy and most of all danceable. This is their third album and they keep getting better. Their music has always been good and their trade mark is "merengue rapido" but in this album they experimented with a cumbia-merengue sound (# 4 El Loco) and bachata (# 5 Vamos a olvidarla) which is an incredible song sung "a duo con Frank Reyes". All the other songs are either fast paced or hard hitting which are essentials components of good merengue. If you have not tried any of the three albums by Azucarado I recommend all of them-Endulzate con Azucarado, Muevete and this one. All are available on Amazon.com. If you like faced paced merengue or merengue "suave" Azucarado's music can offer you the best of the best.
