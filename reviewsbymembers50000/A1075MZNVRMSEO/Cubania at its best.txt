 Issac Delagdo is a legend in his time. This album is a masterpiece of excellence. There's just no other way to describe it. With all the usual Cuban elements that makes his salsa-son so unique he takes his music one more notch up that ladder that's only occupied by a few. If you have been a loyal fan of Issac Delgado you know what to expect from this sonero, timbalero and salsero. This album has sounds of el tres, la clave, las maracas and a lot tumbao. Just buy it. You'll see what I mean.
