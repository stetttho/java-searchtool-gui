 Pochy Familia is back with their old stlye merengue which made them the favourite among many in the 90's. Of late they have not been competitive with other merengue groups but this album is definitely the long awaited come back that many loyal fans have been aspiring. In this album you will hear songs that have "hard-hitting" merengue beats, fast paced rhythms, the kind of merengue that will get you moving. What I also like about this album is that Pochy once again demonstrates his versitality and has included different tropical rhythms. "Weo" and "Solo pienso en ti" are wonderful salsas, "Mariposita" is a beautiful cha-cha which brings memories of the ones we have heard from Coocband in the past and lastly "Eso duele" is a bachata debut (not in the ranks of Monchy & Alexandra) which is quite attractive and comparable to other merengue bands who have included at least one bachata in their cd. Overall this caliber of music from Pochy has been long overdue and I am glad they are back on track. Enjoy!
