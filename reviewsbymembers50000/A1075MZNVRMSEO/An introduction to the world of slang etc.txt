 If you are hoping to get clarification of the meaning of slang, vulgar and obscene terms in Spanish this dictionary & thesaurus is a great intro to this vocabulary in Spanish.  As in any language this is usually hard to learn and understand without exposure and because Spanish is so broad whether you are a native speaker or not it is sometimes necessary to consult a reference to clarify the meaning of a word or expression. An everyday word in one country can be considered vulgar and totally unacceptable in another. This book contains data from Street Spanish 1,2,3 and a thesaurus of terms thematically categorized. If you wish to understand these terms as they are used and terms more specific to a particular Latin country or region, this thesaurus will prove beneficial. I also recommend the Mcgraw-Hill Diccionario del Argot: El Sohez. It is very advanced but is thorough and helpful if you wish to explore the world of idioms and slang in Spanish.
