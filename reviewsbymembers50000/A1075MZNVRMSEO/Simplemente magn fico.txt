 This cd by Victor Manuelle definitely takes modern salsa to it's next dimension. Prior to this album Victor Manuelle was not a well known name when salsa artists were mentioned however with the release of this recording, his third, Victor has become the only salsa artist or "sonero" that gets recognition by many of salsa's greatest artists and avid fans.This album is the most complete display of musical originality (while still maintaining traditional salsa sounds and rhythms) combined with a strong expressive voice by a young promising artist. It would be unjust to praise only one song in this album because all are praiseworthy for their sound, rhythm and exceptional lyrics. This cd is a fine display of musical talent by a salsa artist who will become a member of the exclusive club of artists whose salsa has been titled "salsa coleccionista". Basically this cd or any other by Victor Manuelle will validate the praise and recognition that he has earned. Gracias a l la salsa se quedar en nuestras almas para siempre.
