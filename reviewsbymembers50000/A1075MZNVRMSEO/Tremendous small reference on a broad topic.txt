 This reference has a wealth of information and is geared towards a broad audience. Basically, I would say all adults, couples and anyone who does not have a enough knowledge of the subject matter and its infinite related issues. The book tackles the hard to understand and sometimes explain (if you have to discuss these issues with teenagers and young adults) topics with enough detail and ease in understanding. The chapters are laid out for the most part in a question and answer format. The chapters are quite informative and factual. I especially found the chapter on STDs an eye-opener because there is still so much that is unknown. As well the chapter on "frigidity" (frigidez) may help clarify exactly what is taking place anatomically instead of women acquiring a label of being uninterested. The chapter on contraceptives as well deserves mention. It covers plenty of detail ie. how each contraceptive works, the risk factors and side effects. Overall, this is a handy reference that addresses a broad range of topics as they relate to human sexuality and other issues.
