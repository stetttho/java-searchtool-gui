 Basically this merengue is not authentic and definitely not representative of the genre. This kind of merengue will sell because there will always be people who like the top 10 hits in any category of music and of course people who don't know enough about merengue to really judge this music the way it should be. This album lacks in every way and all songs sound the same. Suavemente is the big hit, it gets a crowd going for sure, it's a nightclub favorite but after that I can't say too much. The rest of songs sound like Suavemente so I can't call this an album...may be Suavamente variations. I am not into bashing albums but honestly merengue like this is not representative of the real Macoy. If you bought the album because you like the song, please do continue to enjoy it. However, if you are serious about merengue please sample the classic Dominican groups that still reign in this genre. You may want to try music from Los Toros Band, Rubby Perez, Juan Luis Guerra, Fernando Villalona and Los Hermanos Rosario just to name a few. But really this album is a misrepresentation of this beautiful Dominican rhythm.
