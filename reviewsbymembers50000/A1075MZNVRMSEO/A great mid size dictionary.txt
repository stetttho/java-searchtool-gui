 This is an amazing mid-size desktop bilingual dictionary and it is one of best references that I own and value it dearly. Larousse is a leader in references in many of the popular spoken languages and their dictionaries usually are thorough and provide a wide variety of information. This one has over a 120,000 translations, a broad range of vocabulary, idioms that give examples of word usage for most of the words and a sample verb conjugation table at the back of the book. This dictionary is from 1994 but language does not change just new words get added to the language over time. Therefore it will definitely be lacking in all the latest information technology terms but will definitely have common everyday words and more. I highly recommend this dictionary for high-school students, Beginner to Intermediate university students, teach yourself students and just for everyday usage be it for professionals or on a personal level.
