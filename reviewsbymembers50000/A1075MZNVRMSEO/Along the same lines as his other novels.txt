 This one like most of his novels reveals themes such as: homosexuality, an inner view of the upper class in Peru and a basic overview of the difficulty one experiences living in a typical Latin American city laden with poverty, crime, filth, drugs (cocaine) and people who live on the street at best with very little hope for the future. In comparison to two of his previous novels- No se lo digas a nadie and Fue ayer y no me acuerdo, this book is the most serene of the three but deals with the same issues. The characters are well developed and Gabriel, the protagonist is a typical Jaime Bayly character. He is gay and suffers throughout the novel due to the fact that his desires are repressed and, as result is frustrated and struggles with his family, life etc. There is satirical humor throughout this novel and is carefully revealed through the dialogue and local jargon. La noche es virgen is an easy read and if you like Jaime B's style of literature you may find the book excellent to read. Personally, I thought the book was good but Jaime B needs to diversify. All his books have the same principal themes (even the newer ones such as La mujer de mi hermano). He is a great author of contemporary Spanish literature but needs to move on. Also I found the book hard to read because there are no capitals.
