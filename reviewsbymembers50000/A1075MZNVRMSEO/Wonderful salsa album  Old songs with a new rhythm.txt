 For those of you who are Colombian music connoisseurs you will notice immediately that the songs on this album are remakes of classic Colombian cumbias of the sixties that have reigned for many years. Fruko y sus Tesos recreated some of the favorites into salsa and "Somos salsa" has turned out to be a wonderful album. With a popular combination of today's salsa sound, lots of percussion and "boogaloo", these songs have been revived and have contemporary salsa rhythms. The whole album can be listened to and danced to in its entirety. There are many treats here. Some of my favorites are: Tabaco y Ron, La Piragua, La Mucura, La burrita, La gota fria, La polla colera, El pescador de baru and Se me perdio la cadenita. All are great for dancing. If you like up beat Colombian salsa, this album is a worthy purchase.
