 I enjoyed this album instantly when I first listened to it two years ago. Rey Ruiz debuts "Fenomenal" with his new record company and he certainly has changed his style. This salsa has new rhythms, new energy and new acoustics. This is a nice come back for Rey Ruiz who has dwindled over the past few years. He virtually has had no significant recognition since his album "Destino" or prior. The only flaw on this album is the quality of recording. There is a lot distortion which is unfortunate because it ruins the flavor of such a tremendous album. The album is great other than the recording flaws.
