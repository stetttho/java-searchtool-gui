 Cronica del desamor is a very interesting novel that reveals Rosa Montero's unique prose and exquisite  and colloquial vocabulary. This is not a novel with plot but rather a culmination of events protagonized by various characters and the central character, Ana. The reader gets a glimpse of Spanish society in a specific era (post Franco I believe) and we witness tales of "desamor" and other life's ups and downs. Ana, is a single Mom, a somewhat unsettled and unsure female who has interesting experiences with males but not really loving any of them. At the same time is searching for self-fulfilment on a professional level in world where men dominate makes Cronica del desamor a novel that anyone can relate to. It's daring, it's realistic and is a unique novel by one of Spain's finest writers.
