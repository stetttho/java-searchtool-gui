 This is a wonderful workbook for Intermediate level Spanish students who wish to instantly build their vocabulary. The learning approach is thematic, meaning each chapter focuses on vocabulary pertinent to a theme such as: At the airport (En el aeropuerto), On the airplane (En el avin) or At the train station (En la estacin de ferrocarril) to name a few. The book provides ample practice exercises, with an answer key at the back of the book and what I found really valuable was each chapter has a mini paragraph about the theme in question that incorporates the vocabulary taught in the lesson. The workbook will definitely help the student to expand his/ her vocabulary because the chapters encompass everyday themes thus detailing everyday vocabulary. I feel it's more for an Intermediate level student because one would have to have a solid base to benefit from the new material presented in the chapters without feeling frustrated and also have beyond beginner reading and comprehension skills. This is a good supplementary study aid to classroom lessons or independent study.
