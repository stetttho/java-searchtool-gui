 This album by Kinito has the type of merengue that will forever make him popular among merengue fans. This merengue has it all; upbeat rhythms and very danceable beats, crazy lyrics, the kind of merengue that will liven up any party. The whole album is a delight. If you are a Kinito Menedez fan, you will enjoy this production. If you enjoyed songs like "Cachamaba", "Anja Juan" and "Grua" this merengue is comparable to those songs that were popular in the 90's.
