 This is a very helpful study aid for Spanish speakers at most levels. I consider it a study aid only because it uniquely covers grammatical points that are geared towards the Intermediate and Advanced speaker but it certainly does not go into depth and definitely does not cover any complex structures. I found it to be very practical, with clear and concise explanations and examples provided. It's not a workbook so don't expect any practice exercises. The back of book serves as a handy reference and covers subject matters outside of the grammatical realm such business writing, idiomatic expressions, thematic vocabulary etc. This book is an excellent complement to a good grammar book. It definitely is handy for clarifying doubts from time to time and the grammar topics cover are the most typical reoccurring grammar points that present difficulty for learners of the Spanish language. The lessons are in English with relevant examples in Spanish.
