 This is a showcase of the best of best by the renowned record label J & N records. They have it down pat. Year after they compile the top tunes of the selected musical category, in this case bachata and the cd always is a supreme compilation of top hits. This time however they have really out done themselves with the caliber of bachata that they have included in this cd. All the songs are wonderful and the selection of artists are some of the modern day bachata greats such as Alex Bueno, Raulin Rodriguez, Monchy & Alexandra and Junior & Jorge. This cd can be listened to with no interruptions, these are eleven super bachatas worthy of all bachata lovers'patronage. High recommendation given. This is a great compilation cd.
