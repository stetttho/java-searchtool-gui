 Tono Rosario is one the finest merengue artists of all time and this cd "Yo soy Tono" has been classified by the artist himself as his best production ever. I agree with him but I think all of his productions are great. What makes this album stand out is the uniqueness of style and tempo of merengue which Tono has not displayed in previous productions and also the merengue in this cd just has a different flavour all together. Tono displays incredible musical creativity while maintaining the caribbean-style merengue sound which has set him apart from other merengueros. This definitely is a dancer's cd but Tono did forget to include a sincere ballad and also a reggae debut which is also quite impressive. If Tono keeps producing merengue of exceptional quality, we will be dancing for many years to come. A superb production "de nuestro cuquito del alma".
