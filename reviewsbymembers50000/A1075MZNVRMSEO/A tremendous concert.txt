 It was truly a pleasure to watch this concert on DVD, Mark Anthony "live" at Madison Square Gardens. Not knowing what to expect from one of the most popular modern day salsa artists, I can truly say that Mark A is an excellent live performer. His performance was lively, charismatic, emotional at times, sincere, and just a downright pleasure to watch. If you are familiar with Mark Anthony's exceptional music repertoire you can imagine the calibre of this performance. Mark Anthony, not a real dancer per se but definitely compensates with his mobility across the stage, his tantalizing chants to the audience and his unique self expression. Some of his most cherished songs were sung: Te conozco bien, Nadie como ella, Y Hubo alguien and Hasta ayer among others. The audio and lighting is superb as well as the DVD itself renders a crystal clear picture. No doubt Mark Anthony is a great salsero and he's here to stay. He is definitely the pride of Puerto Rico and all los boricuas en el planeta. Awesome show!
