 I struggled to finish this book simply because of the way the story of the two protagonists was written. Salome (the mother) and Camila (the daughter) never met each other because Salome died when Camila was very young. Salome was a famous poet in the Dominican Republic and lived during a difficult historical period in her country. On the other hand we see the life of Camila, a retired schoolteacher who is about to leave the US to live in Cuba and play a role in the Cuban Revolution. Salome is by far the more interesting character and her poetry was pivotal in the Dominican revolutionary period. Out from her writings the reader learns more about the DR during the 16th century. Camila seems more disoriented, unsure of herself and did not live the life that she wanted to and being more active in the Cuban political sphere did not change her life at all.  The book is interesting from the point of view that it relates the story of two people's life, mother and daughter in two distinct time frames but it would have been more interesting if I had known more about Dominican political history because the book is heavily oriented around their history. I think this one of those books that will either captivate you or not interest you at all but I say it the reader's choice if you are curious and if you like Julia Alvarez as a writer.
