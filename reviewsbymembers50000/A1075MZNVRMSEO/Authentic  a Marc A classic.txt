 Marc Anthony's Spanish language albums are usually exceptional and unique but he really took his talent an extra mile here and this is a show case of one of best salsa albums produced in the nineties. Everything in Contra la Corriente is on point- the voice, the acoustics, the lyrics and the emotion. What can I say this is exceptional salsa by an exceptional artist. This is a great album for true and new salsa fans, all the songs are great for listening and dancing (yes, although it's not fast salsa). My ultimate favorites on this cd are: Y hubo alguien, Contra la corriente, and Me voy a regalar. This is a very special album, I don't think the artist himself can top this one. In a nutshell- beautiful salsa!
