 This is a good novel by Jaime Bayly. He explores the same themes as in No se lo digas a nadie. However, the protagonist Gabriel is very different from the protagonist in his previous novel. Jaime Bayly once again focuses on homosexuality and drug abuse & addiction as the two main themes and a secondary theme is the lack of acceptance by his parents and his own personal struggle with his identity. Reading a book like this gives one exposure to a controversial theme and the internal and external struggles that homosexuals face in society. My only question is: Will Jaime Bayly stray from this subject, ever? This is the fourth Jaime Bayly novel I have read and in all his novels the same themes are addressed. But nevertheless this hard to ascertain novel is worth the read.
