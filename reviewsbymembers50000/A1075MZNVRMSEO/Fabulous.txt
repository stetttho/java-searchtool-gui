 The first reviewer beat me to it. I also agree that El Mayimbe's bachata is exemplary and this new album Lloro for sure has some classic tracks in the making. This is the first Antony Santos album that has bachatas only and he proves his exceptional talent once again with a wonderful line up of songs. This one does have a sentimental feel to it and some tracks are somewhat slower than others. All the bachatas are good but track #1,2,3 and 5 really stand out IMO. If you are a Mayimbe fan and a fan of bachata in general treat yourself to this production.
