 This dictionary of Spanish slang and colloquial expressions is a very complete learing tool organized in a user friendly format. Like all dictionaries the expressions are in alphabetical order and also the country or region of frequent usage is indicated along with how to use the expression in a sentence. This dictionary would be useful for all Spanish speakers at all levels due to the diversity of the Spanish language. There is definitely a variety of expressions which one may have heard in colloquial speech but unsure of the meaning or the dictionary can be used to learn expressions and to broaden everyday speech. I recommend this dictionary to anyone who wishes to expand their colloquial and everyday vocabulary in Spanish.
