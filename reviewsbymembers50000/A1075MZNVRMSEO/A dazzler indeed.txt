 The has to be one the best Cocoband productions ever. Pochy (Alfonso V?squez) is a very talented artist who not only stands out for his merengue but has incredible salsa and cha cha talent. Pochy's Cocoband is unique and dominated the 90's merengue era especially until around 1997 (a humble estimate). This particular album surely played a huge role in the band's success since it contains hits like "Salsa con Coco"," La compota" and "A usted lo botan". These songs were crowd favorites but the others too could have easily been favorites among loyal fans. El Arrollador, a very appropriate title is a must have for merengue fans and it's a nice reminder of an era in merengue; very up tempo, fun lyrics, good dancing. Once you hear this album you will understand what I mean. It's one of those that can be played from start to finish without skipping a song on the cd. Merengue like this is nice reminder of how great "true merengue is". This album is a rare find and is a Pochy y su Cocoband classic.
