 As I write this review, I find it difficult to describe my thoughts, as the book is not action packed with neither events nor an intriguing storyline. The story revolves around the love relationships and ups and down of the protagonist, Blanca and as we progress through the book we learn how she deals with the various stages of her life that she experiences with her husband and two other men that come into her life at a later period of time.  It's a mellow read worthwhile if you like the works of the author. I must compliment her prose and writing style. It's very exquisite and eloquent.
