 I had no idea what to expect from this album because Wilbert Manuel is not a high profile bachatero. However, his talent does not need to be justified. This album has it all and for a second album this artist has gone from being very good to just outright sensational. This album combines musical elements that makes for terrific bachata music. The rhythms, his voice, the lyrics are all exemplary and the only requirement is just to purchase the album and enjoy this unique bachata music. The album has ten wonderful songs that can be played right through to the end.
