 Valeria is one of the very few female bachata contemporary artists and with this cd I say she has tremendous talent and potential. Discovered and promoted by Luis Vargas, a veteran bachatero has enabled her to make an impact immediately. I had only heard one song on a compilation cd- #2 Hombre como tu and I was intrigued. The rhythm of this bachata is slow definitely I would place under the "bachata del pueblo" category and the lyrics all have meaning and are well express by Valeria's strong voice. All the bachatas are great and the surprise for me was that the merengues are as well. This cd has exemplary bachata and is worthy of your patronage. I give it 5 stars 10 if could for such a tremendous production.
