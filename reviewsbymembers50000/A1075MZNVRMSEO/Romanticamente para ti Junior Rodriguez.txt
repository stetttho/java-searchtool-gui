 This is a great bachata album by this artist and I confess I stumbled across this cd in Miami a couple of weeks ago when I was looking for other bachata music. I took a chance on it and I am happy to say that it is a worthy purchase and the bachata is authentic. This bachatero for sure has charisma and the musical arrangements are top notch. This bachata is wonderful for listening or dancing its your choice but the lyrics are definitely sentimental. About his voice, he definitely has exceptional talent. In this cd his voice is soft but convincing at the same time. There are three merenbachats on this cd and they are quite good especially the first two. If you like bachata surely enough you will find this cd a quality production and very sentimental. Who is he comparable to? I would say Raulin Rodriguez, Frank Reyes and Bienvenido Rodriguez somewhere along those lines. Anyway no doubt about it this cd is up there with some of best bachata productions. Do enjoy it!
