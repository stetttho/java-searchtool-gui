 In this album I think Boney James reminds us of how unique his talent really is. In this one "Body Language" he combines beautiful vocals with the sax and other great instrumental nuances. Also, I sense a combination of R & B rhythms with his unique contemporary jazz sound. This album is definitely one of Boney James best. It's great for easy listening in any atmosphere or simply mellow background music. I highly recommend this album if you don't yet own it. I don't even think James himself can top this one. Great musicianship displayed by a top rate contemporary jazz artist!
