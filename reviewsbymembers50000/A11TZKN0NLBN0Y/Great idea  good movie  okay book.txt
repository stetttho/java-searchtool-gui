 Blood Work is a timely subject, foreshadowing ethical, political, and personal questions which will become more important as we adjust to the transplantation and creation of body parts to keep ourselves alive. The basic story revolves around FBI profiler Terry McAleb's need for, acquisition of, and resulting complications from receiving a life-giving heart donation from a murder victim. Although Connelly's work is good in itself, Brian Helgeland's screenplay makes the story come alive in ways the book cannot. Clint Eastwood has been criticized for many aspects of his self-directing, self-producing, and self-starring roles, but the movie works and it is much more entertaining than the book. The May-September Wanda De Jesus-Eastwood romance enhances the story's theme of renewal of life and adds more poignancy than is possible in the book where the two characters are closer in age. Although Paul Rodriguez's over-the-top performance as the PO'd Latino detective is distracting (albeit, with some funny lines), I think it brings out the ethnic interplay of the characters and the environment better than the book does. After all, this is LA, and this is today. But where the movie really shines is in the portrayal of the villain. In the book, we catch only fleeting glimpses of the killer and never hear about his motives from him. However, in the movie, the villain is an integral part of the story. His life and motives may be a little too obvious and perhaps subtract from the suspense, but the book doesn't do any better job of fleshing out evil. The ending also shines in the movie but falls short in the book. Connelly gave us little dread or anticipation. The movie delivers both, not only with Eastwood's constant concern about his heart transplant going bad and a violent bout with a burly Russian, but also with the final confrontation between Eastwood and the killer himself. All in all, an okay book, a better movie, but not an all-nighter.
