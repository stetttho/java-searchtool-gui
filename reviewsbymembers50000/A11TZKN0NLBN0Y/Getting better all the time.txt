 Another great thematic outing. Like an all-star pitcher who toys with you, showing you a slow curve, then a change-up, then an off-speed slider, just before knocking your socks off with that legendary 100+ mile-an-hour fast ball, Sarah Brightman's sweet, fragile, little-girl voice sets you up with a quaint pop ballad just before hitting you with that glass-breaking aria. And that's her charm and allure -  the suppressed power always lurking just beneath the surface that can explode at any time to knock the audience out of its seat. She's probably done more for classical music than a thousand symphony charity balls. A unique niche she is carving out for herself in world music.
