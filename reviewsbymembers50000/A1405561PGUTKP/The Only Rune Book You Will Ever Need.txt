 Anyone who likes history and is interested in runes should look no further. This book contains everything you would ever want to know about the history of runes. This one book also provides information on how to make runes, how to read the runes, and of course, how to use them. There are no overly religious overtones as there are in some books about runes that for me take away from the pagan mystique. Also, the illustrations in the book are excellent which aid in learning the runes. If you don't like history and prefer to simply know how to use them, not a problem, just skip ahead in the book.
