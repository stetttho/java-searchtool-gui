 This is a superb book in every way. First off, it comes in hardcover which I often prefer.  The author discusses 21 different types of trees: birch, rowan, ash, golden gorse, alder, willow, hawthorn, royal oak, heather, holly, hazel, apple, aspen, entwining ivy, broom, blackthorn, elder, yew, nameless day, pine, and beech. Each section discusses three areas of each tree; mystery which provides historical information such as where it came from, who transplanted it, who worshiped it in older times, and its life span; the trees magical use for spells and what its main power is; healing is discussed and how each tree has special healing abilities. The author also provides information on the Ogham Alphabet (the celtic tree calendar along with symbols). What is extra special about this book are the photographs. They are full size pictures of the trees in various surroundings and in color. There are no artists interpretation of what the tree looks like, this book shows you the trees in the best photos of trees I have ever seen in a book. If you are looking for a book about trees, what their magical use is, what they represent, etc., then this is the book for you. With incredible amounts of information combined with excellent photographs, personaly, I feel you would be hard pressed to find a better book about trees anywhere. Blessed Be.
