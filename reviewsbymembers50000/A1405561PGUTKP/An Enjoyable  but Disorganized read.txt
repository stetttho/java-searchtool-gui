 This book is a joy to read. Right away you can tell that this book was put together with love. It provides all kinds of information about and what you can do on each of the sabbats. My only problem with the book was the organization. It is difficult, even with ear marking pages, where to find something you previoulsy read and want to look over again. Other than that, it's a delightful book and I'm glad I own it. Blessed Be.
