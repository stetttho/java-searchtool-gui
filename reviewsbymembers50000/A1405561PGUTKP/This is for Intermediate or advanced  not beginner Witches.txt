 Dunwich has written a good book for candle magick, but her book focuses on very specific things to do and not to do. She also provides some basic info on colors, and what they represent. There's also some nice tid bits of historical information that I enjoyed reading. However, I don't feel this is a good book for someone just starting out. For me to sit here and type all the reasons I believe it's not for beginners would take to long, so I'll just reemphasize that if you have practiced candle magick already, and are comfortable with it, then this book is for you. I know I'm not providing specifics, but I really don't have the time right now to tell you every single detail..Blessed Be.
