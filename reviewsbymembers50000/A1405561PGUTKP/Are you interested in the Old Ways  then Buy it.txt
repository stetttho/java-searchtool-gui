 This book is not as easy to read as others. The Farrar's in this book have a tendency to ramble a bit, and the continuous use of references throughout the pages make it difficult to follow at times, however....... This is an excellent book, make no mistake about it. From the opening ritual, the great rite, the closing ritual, and all the sabbats, this book makes for some fascinating and informative reading. I've got pages ear marked all through the book. So, the bottom line here is simple, if your interested in the Old Ways, and you want guidence on rituals and the sabbats...then buy this book, you won't be dissapointed.  A personal note to the Farrar's, another masterpiece, I thank you very much...Blessed Be.
