 I'm in the process of adding Runes into my BOS, and this book has become a very useful guide. Peschel doesn't go into any historical detail, instead she gets right to the matter at hand, how to use runes, what there used for, how to make them, etc.  This is a small and inexpensive book that is packed with a lot of information. If your looking for historical information on runes, look elsewhere, if however your'e looking for information on what the runes mean, how to use them, how to make them, then this is an excellent book. In fact, I recently wrote a review on "the complete illustrated guide to runes" by Nigel Pennick, however, I wrote that review before I purchased Peschel's book.  So, for the sake of clarification, Pennick's book is superior in historical value, but it is a bit lacking in the actual usage of runes. Peschel's book is lacking in history, but is jammed with information on how to use the runes.  So there you have it, two reviews in one.
