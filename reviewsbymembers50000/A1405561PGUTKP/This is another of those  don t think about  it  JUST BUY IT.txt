 Ok, here we go: are you a Witch? are you interested in oils, incents, and brews? if you answered yes to any of the above, then buy this book. Cunningham has created an easy to read and understand book while at the same time he is providing valuable information. No one single book is going to answer all your oils, incents, or brew questions. If one book could do all that it would weigh about 50lbs and cost some serious money.  So, if you want to know about oils, incents, and brews then this is one of those books that you really should own. Blessed Be.
