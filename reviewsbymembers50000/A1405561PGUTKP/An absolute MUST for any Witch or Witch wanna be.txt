 This video provides anyone interested in Wichcraft the basic FACTS (not myth or blind superstition) that every Witch should know. For example, the  tools of the craft and how they are used and how they are NOT used, how  Witches do NOT worship the devil, we do NOT hold sexual orgies, and we most  certainly do NOT hold animal sacrifices, etc.. Information about the  various types of Witchcraft, such as Gardner, Alexander, and traditional,  just to name a few is also provided. This one video provides the very  foundation of knowledge that every Witch should have or would want to have.  If you have never bought a single book on Witchcraft, and you are not sure  if it's for you, then don't buy any books until you watch this movie, and  after watching it if you feel that, yes, this religion is for me, and you  feel as if you've come home, then all I can say to you is, Welcome to the  Craft. This movie was worth every penny. Blessed Be.
