 This is the first book among many that I have purchased since my interest in the Craft took hold. It is without a doubt for me the best beginners book on the market. Cunningham takes you from absolute zero knowledge of the Craft, wipes away all the dogma that surrounds the Craft and replaces it with FACTS.  What Wicca is, where it came from, the Gods and Goddesses, rituals, spells, you name it, for the beginner it's in there. This book is worth absolutely every penny. Blessed Be.
