 If your a solitary Witch, chances are you already know most of what the book could tell you, however, if you are interested in a Coven, or starting a Coven, then this book is an absolute must. It takes you from ground zero and explains all the in's and out's of starting a Coven, being involved in a Coven, etc. Although I am a solitary Witch right now, I do plan on joining a Coven eventually, so I bought the book to get an idea of what a Coven could be like. I was impressed with the vast amount of information Amber K put in this book. I've got pages ear marked throughout. What else can I say, it was worth the money. Blessed Be.
