 If your interested in Runes, this is not an all together bad book. It provides the basic information you will need in order to use Runes, such as the single reading, the 3 way, or the runic cross formation.  However, if your a Witch, and I'm assuming you are, then Blum's continuous refernce to christianity is liable to upset you. It most certainly bothered me. I also had a problem with his interpretation of the Runes compared to other information I have come across in my research. Blum's definitions seem overly dark and carry a lot of negativity to their meanings. So, the book does provide SOME good information, but I personally think you would be better off researching the Internet and gathering your Rune info from there, and cross reference the different web pages.  I plan on using bits and pieces from Blum's book on the Runes, and combine it with other information I've come across to make it my own before I write about it in my BOS. But, to be honest, had I known then before purchasing his book, compared to what I know now, I would have saved my money and headed straight for the Internet.
