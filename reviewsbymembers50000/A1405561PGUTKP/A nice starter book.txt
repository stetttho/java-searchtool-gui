 If your interested in the Craft and you don't want to spend too much money trying to decide whether it's right for you, then try this book. If you are already familiar with the Craft in any fashion, or if you are looking for a good spell book, this book is not for you.  I bought this book early in my decision to investigate the Craft, but not until after I already bought and read Scott Cunningham's "WICCA, The Guide for the Solidary Practitioner," so for me the book was OK, but not great.  So, if you already know something about the Craft, look elsewhere, but if you are curious and have no background information on what Witchcraft is about, this is an excellent book for you.
