 This book, as well as the other two in the series of three, is a must read and own for all Witches. Oh sure there are some minor problems, such as in her third book with the missing lesson plans, but so what.. Each of the books takes you on a magickal journey. You will discover just about everything you could imagine or would want to know about Witchcraft from reading her books. However, I strongly urge anyone interested in her books, to purchase all three. Although each book is well written and can be used independently, each book in my opinion compliments the other. I was very lucky to see all three of her books together on the shelf in the book store, and quickly grabbed all three (the last ones the store had). Blessed Be.
