 This book bothered me somewhat. Bucklands use of black candles is a bit mixed up. Black is used for protection, or at least it is in every other resource I have come across.  I also had a bit of a problem with his magick spells geared towards christians, however, in all fairness to Buckland, he does point out that Witchcraft is a religion, and magick is a practice. That said, I took a pencil and slashed every page that carried christian invocation of spells ( a personal choice so I wouldn't waste time reading the wrong version ).  Overall, it's not a bad book on candle magick. It provides some interesting spells to use, despite my disagreement with Buckland's choice of colors and what there suppose to be used for or what they represent, but hey, that's my personal choice. Which leads me to this statement..I don't believe any spell should be used per batem from a book. You look at the spell, you read it, and to make it your own, YOU CHANGE IT, even just a little.. So, if you want a book on candle magick, this one is ok. Take what you like from it and simply disregard the rest. Blessed Be.
