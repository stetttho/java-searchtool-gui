 I can see why this cookbook has sold millions of copies.   There are 1000s of recipes with lots of colorful photographs.  Nutrition information is also provided.  My favorite recipes are those for the chili rellenos casserole and pepper-lime chicken.  This book makes a marvelous gift for beginners and experts.
