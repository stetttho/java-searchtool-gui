 This book is a great introduction to stars in science, art, and religion.  The illustrations help the reader to understand complicated concepts.   My favorite parts of the book deal with the anthropic principle.  These sections address the question: Was the universe designed?  I also liked the sections on the evolution of multiple universes.    Even though the book has sections on art (e.g. Van Gogh) and religion (e.g. stars in the Bible), the book could certainly be used as a hard-core stellar astronomy textbook because it covers everything you would want to know about all the variety of stars in outer space (evolution, nucleosythesis, stellar anatomy, spectral classes, black holes, etc.)    Science-fiction buffs will enjoy the very strange and very interesting tale about an oddball set of characters who journey to the end of the universe to make investigations.  A cool book.
