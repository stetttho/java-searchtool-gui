 A friend ordered this book, and when I saw it, the book was not a large as I expected, and I would have preferred to have a little more commentary.  Some of the information was useful, and the price is right, but I hope a second edition will have additional "meat" and commentary.  Buy the book to learn what eBooks are all about.
