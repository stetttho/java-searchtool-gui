 I bought this book the other day, and I have to say I never saw anything like it.   The best part was that the story is true.  There really was Mary Toft who seemed to give birth to rabbits.  One warning: there are some strange "side stories" here that you might need a strong stomach to read.   But when you finish the book, you will have learned a lot about history and medicine and science.  Well written.  Fast pace.   Nice figures.
