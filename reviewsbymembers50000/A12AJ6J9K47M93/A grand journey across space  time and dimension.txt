 A grand journey across space, time and dimension. When reading Hawking's latest gem, other illustrated books on space and time come to mind, most notably Cliff Pickover's tetralogy: "Black Holes: A Traveler's Guide," "Surfing through Hyperspace," "The Stars of Heaven," and "Time: A Traveler's Guide."  If you like Pickover's book, you'll love this one.  Hawking discusses everything from black holes and the origin of the universe to strings, membrane theory, parallel universes, and quantum mechanics.   The universe is so strange, one wonders whether scientists will ever be able to understand it in its totality.  Buy this book to start the journey.
