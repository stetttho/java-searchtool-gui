 I'm fascinated by religion and physics.   In this book, we get a wonderful blending of the two.   The book consists of an interview between a Buddhist monk and a professor of astronomy.   Much of the book focusses on space and time and the anthropic principle.  The best parts are those that get us to question the ultimate nature of reality.  To get you in the mood, here is a quote: "The mind is behind every experience in life.   It is also what determines the way we see the world.  It takes only the slightest change in our minds, in how we deal with mental states, and perceive people and things, for 'our' world to be turned completely upside-down."  -- Matthieu Richard and Tringh Xuan Thuan, The Quantum and the Lotus
