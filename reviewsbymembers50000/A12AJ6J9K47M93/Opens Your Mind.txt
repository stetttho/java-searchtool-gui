 Good job!  Clearly writen and compelling. This book opens your mind to all kinds of combinations of genius and frailty.   What does IQ really mean? How weird is Nikola Tesla?   The parts on obsessive compulsive disorder were interesting.  I think this book might be helpful to parents who have kids with social or medical problems while at the same time displaying special talents.
