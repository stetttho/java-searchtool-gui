 A very nice compendium, and I love the illustrations.  I hope a future edition will have the sources for each quotation (or at least a book title or article title for each source, when they are known).  In fact, the author can solicit sources for each quote if they are currently unknown to him, to help with a second edition).  Overall, a great job.
