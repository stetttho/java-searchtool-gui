 The battery croaked after 5 years. I just bought the same thing again.  It will probably last longer if you follow the instructions. It's apparently a lead-acid battery and should always be recharged before it gets too low, which I did not do.   According to the manual, the battery has enough juice to completely inflate 8 car tires or run an 8 watt TV for 14 hours. Max output is 15 amps @ 12 volts.   Shop around. An orange logo home improvement place sells these for a good price.  PROs:  The CC2300 is perfect for tires.  The built-in pressure gauge and clip-on inflation hose make tire inflation a breeze.  You're going to waste money on gas unless maintaining your tire pressure is real fast and easy. This unit makes it real fast and easy.  It's compact. It has little compartments for all the accessories (charger, hose, 12 volt cord, extra fuse, etc.)  The switches and indicator lights are clear, sensible and ergonomic. The handle, and everything about it is to like.  The cigarette lighter socket lets you use it as a 12 volt power supply, and also lets you recharge the unit from your car's cigarette lighter. (I never used these features.)  CONs:  It has very low air volume for air mattresses or large beach toys. I wish they had doubled the air volume and maxed the pressure at 115 PSI instead of 230 PSI.  It's "household quality" not industrial quality. One of the little compartment covers broke the first day I had it.  Strangely, you are not supposed to use it while plugged in to 110 volt AC.
