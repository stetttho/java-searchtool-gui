 This book confronts one of life's most personal and fascinating paradoxes. Science shows us that the brain is a heap of very fancy chemistry. Yet through consciousness and feelings we experience something more.  The book starts with an exhaustive inventory of traditional and religious thought on the subject over thousands of years. You may want to skim this section.   McGraw then summarizes in 150 pages what modern science has discovered about the workings of the brain.  The third section shows how and why we naturally cling to spiritual beliefs and offers a conclusion.  A great read for anyone interested in science vs. religion or the mind-brain conundrum.
