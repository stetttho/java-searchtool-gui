 I am a homeowner who has done dozens of minor and major electrical projects over the last 20 years.   This book is full of practical tips and details I have not seen in the basic books. I wish I had read it years ago.  Not the best starter book, it's for those who want to go beyond the starter books.  Cauldwell has and conveys a deep understanding of the electrician's work. His many insights and "Above Code" sidebars help you do a better job than your $60 an hour electrician would do.  Heavy emphasis on mechanical tips...fishing, drilling, etc. which is usually the most challenging part.  Excellent photos and illustrations.  I don't give it 5 stars because there's too much missing. How many conductors are permitted in size X conduit? What gauge wire do I need for 50 amp service? What if it's a long 100+ ft. run? Can the ground wire be a smaller gauge? The book desparately needs reference tables for this kind of stuff.   There are no tips for pulling wire through conduit, bending PVC conduit, or outdoor wiring in general.     Too bad, beacuse in many respects this a masterpiece.
