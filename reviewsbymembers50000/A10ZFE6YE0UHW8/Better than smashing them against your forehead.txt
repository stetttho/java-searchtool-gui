 Crushing your cans is a great idea if you are tight on space and far from the recycling center and you go through a lot of canned beverages. And you don't mind cleaning up the whole sticky crusher and surrounding area.  That's a lot of ands. I see why nobody has bothered to design a good can crusher.  This one only squishes them to 1-1/4 inches. That's less than 4 to 1 compaction for a 12 oz. can.   I put a block of wood in the bottom so the cans would squish to about 6/10 inch. That's 9:1.  However the side arms are very flimsy and started twisting into a useless shape after I crushed about 90 cans.  Also, about 5% of the cans fly out of the chamber before the crusher has a chance to do its work.
