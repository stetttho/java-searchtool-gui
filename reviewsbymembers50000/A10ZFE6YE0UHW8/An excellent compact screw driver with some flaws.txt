 Really handy for driving screws.  Fits in your pocket while climbing a ladder.  Fits in a small tool-box.  Good for low-clearance uses (6 or 6-3/4 inches from driver tip to heel).  Plenty of torque for medium duty. Sinks drywall screws without pre-drilling.  At 130 rpm, it's painfully slow for drilling.  Nice feel, ergonomic handle and triggers.  A great value, especially if you find it with single digit pricetag at discount store beginning with "W".    The owners manual says to use only alkaline batteries (4-AA), but you'd be a moron to do that. 2100 mah NiMH rechargables work great, last a long, long time, and only cost as much as 2 or 3 sets of throw-aways.  One disappointment is the spindle lock, which you can use when hand turning a really stubborn screw. It does not disable the motor, so it does not serve as a safety OFF when stowing. It would be nice if the spindle auto-locked whenever the trigger is not pressed and if some safety OFF mechanism was included.
