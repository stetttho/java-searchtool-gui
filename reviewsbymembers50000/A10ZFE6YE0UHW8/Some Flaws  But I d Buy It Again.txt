 I bought this to replace a nearly identical Norelco 5825-XL that I used for 12 years until the NiCd battery faded.  This one indicates battery level with 5 LED's, which is nice.    The case is flimsy or "lighter and more compact" depending your viewpoint.  The marketing geniuses at Norelco decided on a rather feminine light blue color for this model.   Other than that, almost nothing has changed in 12 years.  This one's made in China. I see nothing sub-standard about it once you get beyond the insult of paying $70 for something with a manufactured cost around $10.  According to the manual, this shaver will cost you an additional $ 395.40 over 12 years because you should replace the razor heads once a year. The heads on my old 5825-XL went 12 years with no problem, thank you.  The Norelcos might not shave quite as close as foil-headed reciprocating shavers, but they're quiet, comfortable, and good at tackling 3 day's growth and/or difficult parts of your face.   If I lost this shaver, I'd buy the same one again.
