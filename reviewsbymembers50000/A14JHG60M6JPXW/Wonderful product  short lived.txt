 Even when directions are followed rigorously, the probes on these guys are prone to melting down.  I've purchased one from all the major distributors, and they all work the same.  Taylor or somebody needs to sell a 10-pak of probes, instead of me buying a whole new unit every 4 months... They do work great though.  I use an older gas oven that has trouble maintaining proper cooking temperature.  The secondary dial that I've installed inside can read as much as 50 degrees different from the digital dial on the oven.  Because of this, I prefer to probe and track the cooking temp of the food instead so that I can provide a perfectly cooked product.  I also use this for making tea, as 212 is too hot for good tea, and 185 to 195 is a better temperature. Still, the probe does melt down as other have said.  I typically get about 30 to 50 uses before I need to purchase another.  The problem occurs mostly when the oven temp exceeds 350, as I lose most probes when baking breads.  Still, I can't live without it, I just wish Taylor would start selling a package of probes for my dozen `timers' that I have sitting around the kitchen.  It would be 5 stars if the probes didn't die.
