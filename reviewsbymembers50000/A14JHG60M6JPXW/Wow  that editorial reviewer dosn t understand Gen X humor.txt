 Private Eyes is a before it's time soft spoof of the classic English Manor Whodunit, which I first saw as a child on HBO.  It lacks the gross humor of modern spoofs, or wacky physical humor of modern comedy - instead relying a nice two edged comedy with overt jokes appreciated by children and subtle back story humor reminiscent of Shrek for the adults.  Certainly it is predictible, but that is part of the charm of this kind of soft comedy, it plays like an old friend.  It is a movie that I went out of my way to find for inclusion in my children's video library alongside The Princess Bride, because there is only so much Disney drivel that I can take.
