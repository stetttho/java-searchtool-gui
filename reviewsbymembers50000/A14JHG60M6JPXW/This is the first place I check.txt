 Buying a new firearm isnt cheap, and unlike products like electronics, the quality of guns are really all over the place.  This magazine doesnt accept product advertising  unlike GunWorld, Guns and Ammo, and many other mags - so lots of people see it as the consumer reports of the firearms.  This isnt actually true, because they dont use standardized empirical testing, but instead rely on experience and personal judgement, as well as shooting results, in making Buy, Conditional Buy, and Dont Buy recommendations. Considering that even a cheap quality gun is going to run you $500, and you might be lucky to get $350 back from a dealer if you dont like it  getting an experts opinion before you buy is an excellent idea.  If you are looking for an over-under, custom carry piece, or any other quality firearm, you can save yourself hundreds of dollars in lost resale by avoiding some of the junk out there. When I'm looking for a new firearm for my collection, I always check here first for advice.  They cover everything from buying used Mauser's to Kimber Custom Carry's, as well as bird and deer standby's like the 870 or Ruger 77.  Each month usually covers 5 or so "topics", each with 3 guns or products - and the issues are conviently three-hole punched.  I keep mine in a couple top shelf binders on my reloading bench for easy access.
