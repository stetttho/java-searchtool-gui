 Backwoods Home is a wonderful resource for the homesteader, do-it-yourselfer, preparedness people, and the just generally frugal.  Every couple months, a myriad of articles shows up on my door step, covering topics like building a wood fence, foraging for wild plants, the right way to pressure can elk, what and where our civil liberties are going and Lord knows what else!  It's a cornucopia of independence.   One way I explained this magazine to a friend was, "It's better than Mother Earth News, and without the left-wing spin."  The publishers are a small operation, and that keeps a `down home' feel to the magazine I like.  Here's how to tell if you'ld like this magazine.  If thinking about Carla Emery's "Encyclopedia of Country Living", John Seymour's "Guide to Self Sufficiency", "Back to Basics", "101 Things to do till the Revolution", "Five Acres and Independence", "Handy Farm Devices and How to Make Them" gives you a warm fuzzy.  Or you own a grain mill, vegatable garden, pressure canner, livestock, hunting rifle, or have heard of a HDR - you will probably like this magazine.
