 Our ailing plastic sided grader had left broken plastic while shredding it's final pound of Sharp Cheddar, and we decided it was time for a replacement.  I dug Grandma's old box grater out of the attic, and the abused, dented, rusting at the corners carcass stared at us.  I glanced at our pot rack with my wife's green colored Le Cresuet, and my slowing growing collection of All-Clad, and decided that this poor little beat up replacement would make a nice college heirloom for our son. So, we bought one of these KitchenAid graders to match Suzanne's enameled soup pots and Dutch ovens.  Although I hate to say it, we like it best for the fashion value.  The color of the KitchenAid grater matches very well with the enameled kitchenware, apparently even in the colors we do not collect.   As for the functioning, it works like a box grater.  That is, unless you leave that `catch box' on the bottom.  Then it's a knuckle buster.  Although KitchenAid fit the bottom of the grater with a nice rubber pad, they didn't apply the same to the box.  My wife took one swipe, skinned a knuckle, and sent several ounces of Monterey Jack to the dog food bowl and her to the bathroom for a Band-Aid.  Now, the catch pan rests will all of the `inconvenient' sized Tupperware at the back of the baby's play cabinet.   We really don't mind ourselves.  We have several small sized cutting boards along with a couple larger ones, so there is always a clean board to put underneath the grater.  A plate or large bowl works just as well too.  Although a bit pricey for me at full price because a cheese grater is an expected show piece, it is nice to have it coordinated with the rest of your kitchenware.
