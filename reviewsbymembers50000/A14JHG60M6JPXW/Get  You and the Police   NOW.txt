 If you are even looking at this page, it is strongly likely that you are interested in freedom, personal responsibility, and law enforcement.  You and the Police, by Mr. T. Party (I love that name for some dang reason), is the best and easiest primer on individual liberty and the 4th amendment that I have found. Mr. T. Party doesnt have the best opinion of Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs), but he doesnt degrade them either.  His motivation behind writing this book is to help prevent people from making common mistakes that get otherwise innocent people into trouble.  Now that the Homeland Defense Act has passed, I feel that this kind of knowledge is more important than ever.  But, if you are hoping that this book will get you out of a jam, it wont.  He states very bluntly, early in the book, (paraphrased) If you are doing something illegal, this book wont help you. What it will do, is let you know fairly closely were you stand when interacting with the police.  For example, did you know that if you are stopped on the street, and the police ask for your ID, you are under NO legal requirement to give it to them or even your name?  We have a right to remain anonymous, and this right has been upheld by the supreme court.  This book is chock full of little constitutional tips like this, that although they wont win you friends with the police, can keep you from being falsely charged (or charged with something you didnt even know WAS a crime).  Other good to know topics are Terry Frisks, Heightened Expectation of Privacy, how long you can be detained without being arrested, and what to say when being questioned BEFORE you are officially under arrest (and before the LEOs have to give you a right to a lawyer.)   It has been my experience that this book has given me oodles of advice that other people want to know - "just in case", and as far as I can tell, its the easiest to find book on this specific topic.
