 "When A Stranger Calls" reaches a zenith of chilling suspense and terror where no other movie has succeeded in creating on the screen. When it first came out in theatres, the television promotions were more than effective.  Instead of showing a rash of scenes from the movie, it used hidden cameras in theatres to capture the reaction of the audience to certain scenes of WHEN A STRANGER CALLS. The result: Terrifying and Chilling! People actually jumped out of their seats!  This movie is based on a true story about a diligent cop (effectively played by Charles Durning) who brings down one of the most heinous criminals in American history--a psycotic murderer who eventually terrorizes a young baby sitter--(a fantastic portrayal by Carol Kane). The first 20 minutes of the movie will freeze you to your seat. [THE SCENE THEN RETURNS 7 YEARS LATER]bringing back Durning as a retired cop--now private investigator and Kane as a young married woman with two children of her.  At this point, the movie slows down a bit to allow you to catch your breath and get more incite into the characters, then commences a continual staircase of suspense, ultimately finalizing in some of the most chilling suspense scenes ever filmed. I won't say anymore because I don't believe in saying too much to spoil what happens.  I WILL say this:  If you want to witness the zenith of chilling suspense and terror, watch this movie alone, at night and with no interruptions.  If you've never seen it and you want to brave my suggestion, you'll find this film a masterpiece.
