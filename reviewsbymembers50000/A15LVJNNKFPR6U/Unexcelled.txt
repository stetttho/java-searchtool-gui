 Ian Tyson is definitely a "one of a kind" story-teller.  His music is not only hauntingly beautiful, and his voice is not only rich and resonant, but the words to his unexcelled music really hit the meaningful targets of the west-- the Cowboy, the Indian and the Terrain.  Having grown up in Canada and Alaska, and having met Mr. Tyson a long time ago in Medicine Hat, Alberta, truly, Lost Herd is a masterpiece.  Additionally, I have never liked the "worn-out" song:  "Somewhere Over the Rainbow," however, you are in for a very unexpected surprise when you hear his performance.  Country-western music covers a lot of basis, but much like the incomparable Harry Chapin--America's Storyteller, Mr. Ian Tyson holds that title with honour in Canada as, "Canada's Storyteller."
