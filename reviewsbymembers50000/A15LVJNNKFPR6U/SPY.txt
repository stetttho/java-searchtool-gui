 Patrick MacGoohan could have given James Bond a run for his money with his suave technique, down to earth reality in the spy world, and of course, his flare for NOT getting involved with women. He emulated the "true  essence" of what the "spy business" is all about, very much  like Robert Culp and Bill Cosby portrayed in their contemporary and  fantastic series of "I Spy."   Mr. McGoohan's acting, directing  and other skills have surfaced in the past 3 decades, including those  talents where he has collaborated with close friend Peter Falk on a few  Columbo series in which he convincingly portrayed a debonaire villain.  I  wish I could find this video--anyone have it? I'd buy it...wish they'd make  the whole entire series from the 60's SECRET AGENT an availability.  Even  from the early days with Disney in his role as "The Scarecrow from  Romney Marsh" was a thriller.  An incredible actor who casts a spell  of talent to millions, Patrick McGoohan can do no wrong.  He deserves the  best!
