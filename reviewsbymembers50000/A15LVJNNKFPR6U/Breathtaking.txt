 Unlike the assinine comment made at the top of the page by Courtney Kemp, Lara Fabian is outstanding in all features, talented beyond belief, and the fact that she sings fluently, without a trace of an accent in English, French and Spanish, and has appeared with such top talent like Josh Groban and others, has appeared on Movie Soundtracks, and the list goes on.  It's too bad that the derogatory comments made by Courtney Kemp, i.e. that her music befits a 13 year old, and other weird comments, such people as this who CANNOT appreciate talent, should keep their mouths shut.  Lara Fabian is pure magic!   Wes Schrader, M.A.
