 Robert Culp has been my favourite actor since he starred in the Western Series:  TRACKDOWN.  The chemistry between Culp & Cosby was blessed magic and the series went on to win dozens of top awards including 2 EMMYS and THE GOLDEN GLOBE. It was the FIRST action series on TV to be shot on actual locations from Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Italy, Spain, Greece, Africa, the U.S. and Las Vegas.  Robert Culp gained my admiration not only as a most credible actor, but his talents went far beyond the realm of acting. Mr. Culp has play numerous roles, and Mr. Peter Falk has always spoken honourably of him for the roles he played in Columbo. He even wrote some of the stories for the series of I SPY, even donning dual roles. I SPY was a true, down-to-earth portrayal of the spy business.  The ad lib technique of Culp and Cosby engendered a level of talent that has NEVER been equalled. Hats off to the best! Mr. Culp and Mr. Cosby, I hope you see this!!!  --wes shrader
