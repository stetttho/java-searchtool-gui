 Robert Culp & Bill Cosby took the world by storm with their wry humour and impulsive reactions that came across so chemically balanced on screen.  In my book, Robert Culp is a very much under-rated actor whose abilities  exploded with his acting, writing and directing capabilites in the emmy  winning I Spy series.  I'd love to meet the man face to face just to  express my appreciation for his remarkable talents.  Hats off to a great  acting team of Culp&Cosby...
