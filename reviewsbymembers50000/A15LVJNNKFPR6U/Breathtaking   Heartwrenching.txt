 What first appealed to me was the soundtrack--music was composed and conducted by Mr. John Barry of incomparable fame for beautiful soundtracks like:  Somewhere in Time, Out of Africa, My Life,Zulu, many of the James Bond themes like Goldfinger, Thunderball--the list goes on.  When I read a review by some critic who gets paid for voicing a "personal opinion," I usually take it with a grain of salt, such critics gave "Somewhere in Time" only a 1-star rating.  I happened to read the review by a famous movie critic who gave SWEPT FROM THE SEA a poor review.  That being the case, he was either suffering from jet lag or never saw the entire film--his rating of the this moving drama was unfounded. (He should be honest enough to return his fee for his rating and move on to something he can understand)  "Swept from the Sea" not only offers beautiful locals, but EVERYTHING was superbly crafted and executed.   I won't go into the particulars of the theme other than it well illustrates how truly rotten people can be and how "true love" can overcome the greatest of obtacles. It's much more than just a love story, it surrounds one with realizm.  Rachel Weisz, Vincent Perez and Ian McKellen give powerful performances, even when they don't speak.   Overall, if you enjoyed films like Somewhere in Time, My Life, Moment to Moment, this movie will tug at the heartstrings too.  Swept from the Sea is a masterpiece-- a must see!
