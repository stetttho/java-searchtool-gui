 Bertie Higgins possesses a unique talent of blending his melodies and enter-twining them into some singular lyrics.  When one listens to Casablanca, a beautiful love story is opened and one cannot help but  reflect on the movie by the same name that starred the enigmatic Bogie.   Bertie successfully repeats his arresting talents over and over throughout  his album.  Hats off to a great performer!  Well-worth the listening!
