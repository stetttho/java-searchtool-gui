 Gino Vannelli is one of those 'rare' performers who "can do no  wrong."  He is most appreciated when one can sit down without  interruption, put on a pair of AKG headphones and "really" listen  to the talent, the power, the innovation that surfaces from his work.  In a  way, he's like Streisand and others who are not justified on the radio or  on home stereo... you have to get in the deep mood and then YOU are  "moved" to profound appreciation.  I hope Gino reads this review  some day...he deserves 'special honours.'
