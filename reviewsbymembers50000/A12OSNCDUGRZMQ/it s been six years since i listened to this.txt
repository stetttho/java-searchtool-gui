 and i still get the songs stuck in my head.  i think it's pretty amazing.  this doesn't happen with a whole lot of cds, especially ones i haven't listened to in ages. dream is probably the only track that deserves to be on the radio, although there are some other songs that are equally awesome like you create the reason, tree, planet unknown, green light street...  the rest of the songs are probably some of the quirkiest sounds you'll ever hear outside of almost anything.  these tunes are kind of like the feeling you'd get if you're in yoshi's island and just ate one of those floating cotton balls.  the screen gets distorted, colors change and everything seems to sound like a horn played far far away. but no matter how weird it gets, it's always a solid song. there are songs here that are great if you're in the mood, and some that are great no matter what. although there are some weak parts, like a few of the later tracks.  that won't matter though, because you can get this for a quarter plus shipping right now on amazon. buy it for dream, everything else is just nice.
