 it is unreal, the grooves are huge, the sound is gigantic, it is slow as... and when i listen to I, the Witchfinder it makes me want to kill people and die at the same time(in a good, evil way).  buy this if you like thick, heavy, fuzzed out doom/stoner rock. the vocals rule too, cuz they don't sound like grief or eyehategod(though i love them too). it will make your ears bleed!  if some dude walks in and says 'hey man is that staind? blah blah blah' the music will crush his chest and kill him and you will watch and say 'whoa, far out.'...
