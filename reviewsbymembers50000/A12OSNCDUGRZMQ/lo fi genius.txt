 This is a very good album.  One of my favorites.  The thing is full of energy, silly lyrics, and danceable beats.  Great breakdancing stuff, like 'pussy all night', 'bite your rhymes', 'dickface'.  The album is a great break away from standard radio fare.  it offers up something fresh and new, or at least something not rarely seen in today's pop music scene. which would be origionality and style.  jimmy's vocals are amazing in a way, he has a very strong range, makes lots of weird noises(not the same way disturbed does). as with all mindless tunes, jimmy's vocals make up a huge part of the music, so like i've said before if you don't like his voice, you'll probably hate this. this is for anyone who wants something different to listen to, tired of pop artists and bands ripping off of alread established greats but with less effect. you can't really describe mindless's sound because it isn't really like anything out there. it combines elements of industrial/punk/rap/dance/triphop, video game noises.  combined to make one really energetic piece of crap, full of personality.  it might just be that i'm tired of listening to what everyone else listens to, but i've listened to this more often than i'm willing to admit.  just take a listen of some of the tracks, especially the method man cover 'bring the pain', or 'diabolical'.  if you like that stuff, you'll like the rest most likely..
