 It's heavy, it's fast, it growls and shrieks.  But is it origional? not really.  it is all things i mentioned before but there is not one riff in the whole album or any arrangement of music that sticks in my mind and makes me want to listen to it again.  When I listen to it, it only makes me want to listen to cephalic carnage or SYL.  Because those bands do this kind of sound so much better.  There is much better music than this.
