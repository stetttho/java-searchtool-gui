 i would like to echon grimnir's sentiments. and maybe add a few other comments.  this album is not like typical death metal.  it actually sounds intelligent!  no rape/gore obsession(not that i don't like that) here, topics that deal with the ancient, the surreal, and the strange in an origional fashion.  there is not a blues scale in sight, everything is extremely dissonant, wacky, and almost torturous to listen to.  the first time i heard it i thought: ' i know i will like this somewhere down the line, but right now it's too much to handle'.  kind of strange since i listen to so much noise and grindcore, but really the album is something else.  it's overwhelming with it's atonal riffing, spastic drumming, interesting lyrics and strange song structure.  it's like every song was written with a purpose instead of 'metal for metal's sake.'  it's too bad the drummer killed himself... i would have loved to see another album in this style.  maybe somewhere down the line... i'd recommend this to most fans of extreme metal.  if you bought a cephalic carnage album or if you like hella and death metal, you would do well to aquire this album.  it really is a 'breath of fresh air' in the stagnant world of death metal. and it may sound like i'm overselling the album, and that's all possible so take it with a grain of salt.  either way though, it's different.
