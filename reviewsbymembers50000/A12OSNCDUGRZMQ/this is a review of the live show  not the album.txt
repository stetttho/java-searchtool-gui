 i saw this band live with deftones and incubus.  incubus put on a great show even though i don't particularily care for them.  deftones tend to have a habit of sucking whenever they go on live.  they just sound better on cd.  that shouldn't happen.  as for taproot, they sounded horrible.  the only way i could tell what single they were playing was because i could hear the weird techno stuff, which they couldn't possibly screw up because it was all samples.  the guitars just sounded like a wall of static, the singer was hard to hear.  you had to work to tell the guitars and the singer apart.  the drums were hearable and ok but just ok.  there are way better drummers out there,  specifically Primus.  even if you don't like Primus you have to admit that they're good at what they do and you can't get hacks like papa roach to recreate their sound.  if you disagree with that statement, your opinion on anything is invalid.  sorry. in that case, you're parents probably grew you up on crap like AC/DC and Judas Priest so your taste in music is considerably dull.  so yeah, i haven't heard the album, and i'm hoping it's better there.  but i probably still won't like it much cuz i'm tired of that kind of music.  but i suppose you should buy this if you like deftones because the singer does have a decent voice, judging from the singles i've heard.
