 i'm not sure why the one poster gave this cd such a bad review.  i suppose if the only dm you listen to is stuff like suffocation, hate eternal, origin, cryptopsy, and other super techie metal onslaughts this might not be up your alley. but if you ask me, this is one of if not the most widely varied sounding 'death metal' albums i've ever heard.  the styles range from sludgey rock, to faster bits and several areas in between, with each song having it's own identity.  if you don't mind more recognizably song-oriented dm, i would strongly suggest picking this up.  i think fans of darkthrone and eyehategod could like this band a lot. and oh yeah, it is insanely catchy too.
