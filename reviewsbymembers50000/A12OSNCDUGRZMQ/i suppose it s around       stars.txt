 the album definately helps in aiding meditation, relaxation, and other forms of mellowing out and is also a nice thing to have on while you finish your daily rounds around the household.  it's effective in it's trance-inducing abilities, though the vocals on this album don't always rub me the right way.  julian cope has a nice voice, his poetry is ok depending on whether or not i'm in the mood to hear him ramble.  sometimes i think it would work better if his 'vocals' were on a separate track from the droning chords and frequencies that accompany his words on 'my wall'.  the female vocals on the album are a little strange.  i haven't taken to them quite yet, but they're good at breaking up the pieces.  i'm not sorry i purchased this album, i'll probably be spinning it for some time. edit: it's rather funny how when i've given an album time to sink in, it's quirks become endearing. so what can i say, i like i a lot.
