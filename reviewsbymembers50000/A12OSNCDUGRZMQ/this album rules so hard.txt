 i've listened to it over and over about a bazillion times and it never gets old.  i can't say enough good things about this band.  it's catchy, groovy, heavy, ...it's just AWESOME.  any fan of anything should get this album and listen to it religiously everyday because it rules. ... if you've heard the song scrape and liked it, buy all their albums because the rest is just as good.
