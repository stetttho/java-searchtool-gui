 as for that one guy who said 'overrated' i dunno.  just listen to the music yourself and ignore everybody else. but pay attention to me(haha).  i love this album.  it's so easygoing, great beats, lots of weird noises and layers and layers of cushy effects that are oh so pleasing to listen to.  everything flows wonderfully, i'm just 'captivated' when i listen to it.  great industrial, smooth, catchy, danceable, awesome.  it's like what the snog guy says, don't drown in the mire, wallow in it.. if you're feeling down about the drudgery of your everyday life or anything just throw this on and relax.  you'll be in a better mood by the time you're done.
