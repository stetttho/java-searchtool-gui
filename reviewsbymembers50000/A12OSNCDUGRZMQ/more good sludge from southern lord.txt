 this band is big, thick and heavy.  much like other sludgy bands like grief, iron monkey, eyehategod, and otherwise.  the vocals sound like the guy is screaming through a hollow tunnel, the drums have that 'played in a huge echoey auditorium' sound to them.  there's plenty of feedback and grief-inspired riffage going on with this band.  real slow, drunken sludge, occasionally the music picks up for a collage of sound.  i would say they're a solid band in the vein of grief, and they even stand out a bit from the rest of the herd.  much less groove-orientated like dot, weedeater, or any of the EHG clones. they're somewhere right in the middle between those two styles of sludgey doom.  check out the soundclip on www.southernlord.com for a good idea of what the album is about.
