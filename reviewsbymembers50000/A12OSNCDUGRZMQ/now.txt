 i love grind and all... but the production just kills the experience.  this is the first carcass cd i've gotten and i plan on getting more, granted they actually have decent production.  i guess the music is good... hell i dunno. the production is just so [bad] you can't really make heads or tails of any of these songs.  the best thing about this cd is the lyrics and atmosphere of the band.  they use quite a lot of big words, and are very proficient at explicity describing gruesome deaths and mutilations.but... it just sounds bad.  i can't stand hearing a good cd ruined by horrible production.  if you like this album, please im me or something so i can figure out what exactly is it about your psyche that allows you to like this.
