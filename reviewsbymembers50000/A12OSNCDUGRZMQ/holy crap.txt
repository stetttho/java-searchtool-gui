 these guys don't mess around. dirty, raw, pissed, mythologically based themes, a real character of a vocalist.  Like a cross between  Cronos over the top evil approach, Araya's shout etc., and Tom Warrior's guttural stuff.  It's great to hear a metal band with a vocalist I really like, the guy's got persona going here.  The music is metal.  That's about the best way to put it, I suppose.  It's got some blastbeats, sludge, thrashing rhythms, etc.  A nice spread of song writing, though I wish there were more tracks like 'The Wolf'.  It rules.   Anyways, I recommend it.  Not the worst thing you could do.
