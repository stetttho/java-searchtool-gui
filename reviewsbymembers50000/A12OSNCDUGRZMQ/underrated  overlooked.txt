 this is alternative rock music.  it is incredible.  well written, alternative songs that sometimes mix very clever flanger effects in with the tunes that sound so dreamy and just so damn good you will never get sick of it.  it's just that , when you hear the flanger, there are no bad notes. it's just all good, a very refreshing experience you dont hear other bands taking advantage of.  best examples, near end of 'smoking umbrellas', which has a very catchy bassline, 'stuck on you', 'heliotropic', but the best example is in 'another space song'. easily my favorite track on the whole album.  there is just nothing like it. slow, mellow, melancholy alternative with a very well written flanger piece that goes on and on.  it's a little hard to describe this band's sound, but if it helps any they used to open up for tool back in the day.  a perfect circle is slightly reminiscent of this bands more 'intelligent' sounding pieces. yeah thats the word. this is mellow, easy-going, intelligent, space rock. listen to some of the samples, especially, smoking umbrellas, blank, and pillowhead. can't explain, it's just a good album..
