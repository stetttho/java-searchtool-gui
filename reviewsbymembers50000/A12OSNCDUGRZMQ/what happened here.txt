 i don't mind when a band takes off in a new direction, and certainly not in a way that implies that they are 'selling out'. lateralus is a nice advancement for tool and their sound, but i feel that if they're going to try and write six to eight minute songs(if they're going to be this long, you might as well call them 'epics'), you should do a little more with them. to me, this album sounds like they wrote some usual tool material which didn't suck and the song lasted for a good four minutes or so. but cuz they wanted to try something different it sounds to me like they stretched a good four minute song over the span of about six to eight minutes. so when i listen to songs like the grudge or schism, the music seems to 'drag' and feels empty, like it's missing a lot of depth. over the course of the album, i feel like there's a lot of holes in the music and that they are capable of doing a lot more, since tool are comprable(sp?) musicians. if they keep going in this direction, and combine some of the energy(aenmea, hooker with a p3n1s, cold and ugly, prison sex) and ingenuity( message to harry manback, intermission, die eier von satan) they had in previous albums, tool could make one heckuva an album. they need to add more. but as it stands, this is very flat music and there's not nearly enough stuff to keep me interested. i wouldn't say this album is nearly as good as many people seem to think. it's just a long bore. there are a few highlights, the title track, parabola, ticks and leeches, reflection, and faaip de quad. that's a good bit of the album but it wasn't enough to keep me listening. if you would like to hear music similar to tool, i guess you'd just have to listen to the old albums. there are lots of new bands coming out that try to copy the tool sound, but it never sounds as good(earshot comes to mind...
