 / Alright, now as for the album: insanely fast.  Just incredible, the sheer ferocity of it.  I wouldn't say it's as intense as Pig Destroyer(PITY has to be the most abrasive, intense, raw album I've ever heard.  Like an A.C. album with actual songs).  If you're in a good mood, this stuff could get you angry in a hurry. Not that you can't listen to it when you're in a good mood.  I know I do. Scott Hull plays guitar in this band and does some drum programming for ANb.  You can still tell it's him, though with ANb his riffage is more punkbased than PxDx.  JR Hayes writes the lyrics of course, and comparing them to his work with PxDx, I'd say they're mostly subpar.  But this is a different band with a different soul and it fits well. Every song on here(except for Manual Trauma) is great.  If you don't think you can pack a great song with a possible message(you never know with JR Hayes) in less than thirty seconds, you will be proved wrong when you listen to this.
