 so it inspired me to go clear some things up for anybody checking out this album as a result of it(author of 'choosing death's new magazine).  they claim that after the long hiatus between dopesick and this album, they released the worst album of their careers. maybe, but this album still rules and i can't compare it to their debut cuz i haven't gotten it in the mail yet.  plain and simple, it kills.  revolution/revelation will get you pumped up and ready to smash things.  the following tracks after that will make you want to smash things too.  few bands are as  groovy, sludgey, nihilistically pissed off, and just plain good as eyehategod.  that's about all you need to know.  i should note that after the feedback interlude in the middle of the album, it's over for me as my mind has drifted onto other things.  the songs after that aren't bad, they're still better than a lot of sludgebands but even as i write this i can't recall the riffs.  it doesn't really bother me though, because i feel i've already gotten my money's worth after the first half.  at any rate, if you're a fan of sludge or are getting into it, don't let a couple of downer opinions stop you from checking out one of, if not the most prominent names in what could be considered 'sludge metal/doom'.  my favorite EHG songs are strewn across all bodies of their work so if you're looking for a suggestion as to where to start, i suppose 'take as needed for pain', then 'dopesick' or 'confederacy of ruined lives'.
