 there are few bands that can really combine industrial with metal effectively, like ministry.  this band does it impeccably and adds atmosphere to the mix.  some may say it's industrial black metal. some of the riffing styles on certain songs and drum patterns would lead you to believe that, but no.  this band is all about bleak, post-apocalyptic futures not raping christ and worshipping odin.  listen to songs like ad noctum and last call, and it will feel like you're walking through the remains of a wartorn city of a dead world. there are a couple of detractors posting reviews on their latest 'Sick Transit Gloria Mundi.'  don't listen to those guys. metal/extreme music isn't for everyone and especially not those guys who don't even listen to metal as a genre.  they're opinions are grossly misinformed.  yeah the drums are fast and there's lots of screaming... it's metal.  to the casual listener, metal will always sound like a bunch of fast noise unless it's doom. then in that case it's slow noise.  but rest assured, it's music.
