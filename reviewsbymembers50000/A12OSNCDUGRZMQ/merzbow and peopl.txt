 Well after having bought several Merzbow albums and having given each of them plenty of enjoyed listens I've come to the conclusion that Merzbow does not make noise but soundscapes.  Or maybe soundscapes out of noise, whatever. The main point is that he doesn't make the same album over and over again.  Each album I own of his has it's own personality and sound.  This one seems to focus on prog rock sounds interacting with psychedlic waves of noise.  It works surprisingly well.  Here's album:  Aqua Necromancer- whooshing noise sound fx in an organic fashion mixed with some catchy drum beats(from prog rock albums I hear).  When I first heard this track, it was my favorite of his next to Ananga-Ranga from Venereology.  But then I heard...  Contrapuntti Indian-  Probably the nicest thing I ever heard.  Loops of melodic guitar and wah solos weaving in and out of a wash of noise.    Soft Drums- lots of prog drum fill loops, a rather manic track with the usual slice of noise.  Contrapuntti Patto- same formula, this time with Keyboard and drum samples.  Works great, lots of noise cutting in and out of the sound, well played though not one of my favorite tracks.  Farsa Del Buen Vivir- a looped drum beat that is immediately catchy.  I think rap artists would find this a nice thing to sample, but then Akita starts in with what sounds like a noise solo.  Very interesting... and under 4 minutes! Pretty accessible for Merzbow.  One of his better works.  It gets a lot of regular replay with me, recommended.  I'd suggest looking for a more decent price than what amazon has it listed for($44?).  I got mine off ebay for under $10.
