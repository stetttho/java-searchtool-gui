 i'm new to this type of music.  the closest thing i have that compares to Robert Rich is 'lift yr. skinny fists like antennas to heaven' by Godspeed You Black Emperor!!.  that album is pretty cool, but Robert Rich is in a league of his own compared to them.   These two cds complement each other extremely well.  in Numena, the music flows like water.  it's beautiful ambiance, gentle sounds of nature mixed with soft tribal instruments and bamboo flutes to create a serene atmostphere that sets you at ease.  the music slowly builds(and i do mean slowly) and never really gets moving, but it's not supposed to because it's all ambiance. On Geometry, the music uses more instruments than sounds of running water, birds and other types of ambiance, it's a lot more mathematical in structure too, like Rich describes in the liner notes.  On the whole though, this album accomplishes much the same thing as Numena in putting you into a relaxed state of mind.  Listening to these albums creates the great feeling you get when you're in a deep sleep, that feeling of goodness you get when you're well rested.  This is the that feeling turned into a sonic experience.  The music builds up and grows on you, and can require patience in listening but I guess that if you're reading this, you already knew that.  It's too bad I can't think of more adjectives to describe 50/70 minutes of pure peace of mind..  great stuff.  I believe I've found a new level of intelligence in music.
