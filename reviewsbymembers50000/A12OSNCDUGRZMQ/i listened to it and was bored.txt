 that's about all i can say. just a bunch of riffs, nothing that sticks out. boring.  i'd suggest you go listen to deep purple or black sabbath or bongzilla instead.  edit: i later bought welcome to sky valley.  not bad, but not my thing. can't remember anything about mucas gracias. it probably still sucks. :p
