 i honestly don't really like this album that much.  i'm just giving it five stars cuz i love 'dead christian' and 'wash'.  the rest is cool, but there could be way more to the music. it feels like there's a lot missing.  he has cool ideas though.  really goofy. he sounds like an announcer at a rollerskating rink or something and he really really likes his job.  and then there's the really loud drums... the drums rule so much.  they just sound so good. it's like 'stomp' style industrial or something.  but it could be a lot better. the two songs i mentioned are great. there's some other goodies, but i'm mostly giving this a high rating cuz i want to see what other artists amazon is gonna recommend because i like this.
