 this is interesting stuff.  it's a bunch of different static and noise frequencies spun together in an irregular fashion.  the tracks are more like 'pieces' than 'songs'.  some of the noise is accompanied by a 'pulse' which tends to drive the sounds.  i like listening to this when i drive because it clears my head(what is it going to make me think of? static?).  i mean, sure i come up with some visuals to go with the sounds, but really for the most part it's emotionless, like a robot. just layers of static weaving and crashing into each other.   aside from just having something fun, strange, and weird to listen to i'll use this disc for relaxational purposes.  turn the volume down a little and it's some nice background noise.  if i'm in a bad mood and i put it on, it seems to neutralize me.  very cool...
