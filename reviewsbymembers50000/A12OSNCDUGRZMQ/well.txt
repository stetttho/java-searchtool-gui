 ... anyway, this band is catchy as hell. it's extremely well done. it's just plain awesome.  it's like you take all that stuff you like about rock and roll like the pentatonic blues scale, solos you can remember and that big blues beat + relapse grindcore and you get straight up quality.  buy it, then drive around in your car banging your head to it like i do.  the only complaint is that it's too short, short as in you want more when it's over.
