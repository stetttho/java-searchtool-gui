 .... that's about it. whooshing synthesizers, beats, some samples, slightly distorted vocals.  kind of boring.  the overly depressed theme reminds me of high school as in, 'bad poetry' and 'this is lame'. i didn't mind listening to it too much but i probably won't listen to it again. it's nothing special... i prefer merge or maybe vnv nation to this. as far as industrial goes i'll stick with revolting cocks, foetus, and skinny puppy.
