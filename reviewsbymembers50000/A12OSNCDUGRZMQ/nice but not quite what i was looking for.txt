 i bought this when i went into a store to ask this one guy who was into industrial/gothic type music, if there's any kind of music that combines the elements of trance and industrial.  origionally i was looking for something that would be the perfect combination between paul oakenfold's tranceport, and the really noisy nin songs like heresy, reptile, and the big come down.  you know, the noisy grating kind of stuff, with lots of pounding metallic drums. he recommended this compilation because it featured many artists, some of which i'd heard of(velevet acid christ, front line assembly), some not(funker vogt, vnv nation), and was pretty cheap.  so i picked it up and while it is enjoyable, it is easily a lot more trance than industrial.  it's got the nice soothing string synthesizers, mixed together with really fat bass synths and distorted skinny puppy-style vocals/chicks with strong voices(think kmfdm). for the most part, this is pretty danceable, the music hops along at a nice pace, and while it can sound pretty, the distorted vocals add a welcome edge.  think of a slightly underproduced skinny puppy album remixed by paul oakenfold on a so-so day.  no question, though, there are some great tunes on here that i'm liking the more i hear(tracks 1,3,4,8,9, especially), but in the end this isn't quite what i had in mind. if anyone knows of some good noisy trance/industrial like i'm looking for. please email me.  preferably something along the lines of a really distorted drum and bass album, or like meatier versions of 'only good christian is a dead christian', and 'superkalafrajilisticsadomasochism', both by foetus.  industrial beats with meat.  someone has to know what i'm talking about.. please contact me! i need music!
