 Ok, let's get something straight here.  This is classic. And people are selling it for cheap!  If you'd like to hear slow, torturous, sludgy, horrible doom this is what you have in mind.  Grief are highly influential and (from what I can tell) underrated.  The music moves at a crawl, the lyrics are honest and fitting, the atmosphere is there.  Occasionally they'll speed it up a bit for a 'quick' groove but most of the time it's just doom, slow crushing doom.  They use the howling-shrieking-loud-growl-scream vocal method and it suits the music and lyrics well.  What else do you need to know?  Head over to www.Stonerrock.com and seek out a track .  If this is your thing, you'll love it.  I don't know many( if any ) people at all that like this kind of music so I don't know if there are those who sit on the fence.    Recommended.  I give four stars because I'm hesitant to give five though it certainly seems worthy!
