 why do you people buy this?  why do you give these bands the time of day? how many korns do we need? there is ONE korn and ONE is enough for anyone.  this is sickening.  i'm going to start a pop band some day and the first album is going to be called 'take the money and run'. just like these guys! by the way they sound like a cross between korn and static-x but they didn't get lucky in the crossover.  mediocre, boring, uninspired music.  another part in this generation's hair band movement.  do not buy. and say no to staind.
