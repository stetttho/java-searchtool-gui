 This album can be very moving. Once you're lulled into a trance after the beginning of the album, you're all set for the rest of it.  In the entranced state(or rather 'down to speed' with the album's slow pace), you'll feel songs like Purify, Locust Star, and Strength of Fates.  The phrase 'hauntingly beautiful' comes to mind, it's just something else.  The music will build and build and guide you through emotions, or not.   I have a lot of fun with this album, some people might not but oh well.  I look forward to discovering other bands like Neurosis.
