 A guy complained about the production ruining the music.  I don't think so in this case, it works fine.  Burzum has other releases where the production truly is quite (bad), like the aske/self titled.  I think his statemenst would make more sense in that context.  As for the music/album, I'd say Varg has made a beautiful and personal album, his melodies touch on odd emotions that are carried throughout, his songwriting is fine that doesn't really stick to a particular bm aesthetic though it does have that vibe.  I can't complain.  It's a contemplative album that tells plenty about the guy who wrote it if you're willing to pay attention to detail.  Lots of people try to create black metal that is 'true' and 'kvlt', whatever the that is they miss the point of making music(although I do enjoy a good homage to a particular sound).  Regardless of who he killed and what he burned, this guy made honest music and it's pretty darned listenable.  This actually sounds like it came from one mind, one musician, with no other members to contribute their misinterpretations of what Varg was after.  The album runs the gamut of emotions from dark, brooding, sorrowful, introspective, reflective, contemplative, odd melancholy, and the serenity of being completely alone, lost in the wonders of drifting thought uninterrupted.  It's a very human album, if you ask me and I don't think I've really heard anything as personal as this, save maybe stuff like Hank Williams Sr or Today is the Day.  In a word, it's unique and pretty good too.    I recommend it, but surely you're not clueless as to what this sort of stuff is.
