 i like this album a lot.  the only problem though, is that if you're buying it to hear some new dillinger escape plan material, you're only going to get half of what you expected.  i'm not really surprised that DEP hooked up with patton on this, because i felt i heard similarities between some of patton's work and DEP.  i think it worked really well, but just warning you, this is a collaborative effort. since you could call me a fan of patton(my enthusiasm has worn a little thin since the ok fantomas, mediocre lovage and tomahawk projects), i'm very happy with this release.  it sounds like a new mr. bungle album backed by the technical/musical mastery of the dillinger escape plan.  take the gooky weirdness of disco volante, add the catchy, smooth feel of california, then have DEP spin it into gold.  patton adds atmosphere and layered effects with samples and keyboards to make a seamless three-song ep.  it works surprisingly well, though a lot of people could call this blasphemy.  the new sound takes away from DEP's full-on energy apepoop(not an insult) and is replaced with more versatility.  it's not always as aggressive sounding as something like 'the mullet burden' but it's still a nice mix. i doubt they were just trying something new. i love it, since i haven't heard patton make a decent project since 1999.  thank god for DEP.  but that aphex twin cover is worthless.  they do it well, but why?  they could've just made another song.  and if you didn't know, i'm a big fan of DEP too.  they've never let me down, but patton has so i'm a lot more impressed with this than i thought i would be.
