 i like this album a lot.  it's long, engrossing, and ultimately mellow with lots of good vibes.  there's something in the music that sounds like a huge airplane floating in midair, creating a loud rumbling hum that drones on and on.  everything else accompanies this sort of aimless drifting happily about without a care in the world.
