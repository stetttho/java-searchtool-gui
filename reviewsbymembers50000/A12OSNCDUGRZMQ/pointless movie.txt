 indeed, this movie has no point or lessons to be learned as with just about every stanley kubrick movie.  the man has perfected the art of speaking without saying anything.  but i guess that doesn't really matter because the movie is just so good.  a bad bad boy and his fellow droogies go around doing bad things until the lead droogie 'alex' gets arrested and eventually enlists in a special correctional program.  the program works but not as expected, so they return little alex back to his old demonic self.  what's the point? i don't know.  it's just a very interesting movie.  see it if you like sick stuff.  there's worse than this, but no doubt this is rather weird.  the movie has an impeccable sense of style and a very spooky feel to it.  it's also worth noting that the tripped out acid piano renditions of beethoven are topnotch and i would love to find a soundtrack for this.
