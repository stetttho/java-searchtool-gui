 agoraphobic nosebleed chug out ten or so songs of their typical nature: fast as all hell drum machines, scott hull's signature shredding style(although it sounds more punk-based when he's working with ANb).  These are all fine songs, though you should really get their actual albums if you want to be blown away.  they have better material, but this stuff isn't bad. it'd be cool too, if the songs sounded a little more the way you might imagine them, judging from some of their cool titles(glass tornado, pentagram constellation). the converge side is just plain great.  awesome stuff.  you'll hear a great mix of styles, hardcore, metalcore, thrash, and some really nice slower stuff.  the song 'stretch for miles' is worth the price of the cd.  'my great devastator' sounds like a technically proficient hatebreed and slayer collaborating.  just plain awesome. my favorite side.
