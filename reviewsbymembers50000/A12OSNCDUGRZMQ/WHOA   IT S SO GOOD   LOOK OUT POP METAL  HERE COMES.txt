 ..linking park! the trendiest piece of (junk) to come around since the boybands!! these guys make you wonder if there isn't some big agency/production company thing that just slaps together four or five young, relatively good-looking men, tells them to spike their hair, grow goatees, get some 'rad' tattoos  and wear black stuff. then they are told, 'sound sensitive(crooning vocals, whiny 'woe is me' lyrical shtick)so the girls will like it, but not so wussy(that means you scream during the choruses) that guys won't.' now go make popmetal! if you get stuck, here's some korn and staind albums but add some techno bits so you don' sound like COMPLETE rehash.  these guys and this genre of music are the equivalent of boybands, blonde popstars and all that is trendy.  they are totally fake.  the guy has a decent enough voice when he sings, it actually sounds kind of nice, but it reminds me of savage garden.  when he screams he's not as whiny as fred durst, but his lyrics are. they've perfected the nice melodic distorted guitar picking during verse, get 'heavy' during chorus style of song-writing, which nirvana did very well. they are trying to act (....) in the words of pantera, 'you can't be something you're not.' anything but origional, just another fad that i hope will die soon, but not until i'm through having a good laugh at the people who call this metal.  if you like pop, pick this thing up, along with the other popmetal bands like disturbed, papa roach, drowning pool, crazy town, Godsmack even(though 'whatever' is a cool song). stuff like that. but if you like real music, go buy something good like radiohead, slayer, paul oakenfold, the new dimmu borgir. stuff that will actually expand your head.
