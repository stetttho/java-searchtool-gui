 one of the impressions i got from this band is that their main priority is to spread the good word about marijuana. their second priority is to make fun music to listen to while you get stoned.  i think they take both priorities pretty seriously. this album is so inheritantly feelgood and groovy i don't know what to tell you.  they songs are a joy to play and are fun to listen to and you'll have stupid songs like 'sacred smoke' and 'budgun/thc' in your head for quite a while after you hear them.  it's great stuff, though there are a couple of stoner-jams with no lyrics, just samples on this album.... the tempo of this album combined with the way they write wriffs is perfect. ...
