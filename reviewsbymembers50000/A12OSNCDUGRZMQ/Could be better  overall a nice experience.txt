 Red Harvest is interesting to say the least. It generally takes a lot of industrial influence and melds it together with the sounds of more extreme metal, occasionally it reminded me of Sepultura and Fear Factory(don't get picky with me on labels here, I say extreme and mean stuff like Black and Death, I know FF were the latter on SOANM, but I always considered them their own thing..). The ultimate sound of the album is cold, dark, desolate, and hopeless like a cyber-punk suspense thriller's soundtrack. Think of an extension of the way Blade Runner or Shadowrun soundtracks could sound. This can be a very atmospheric album that you could rock out to at the same time. This kind of sound is rarely pulled off well, I feel Red Harvest has a lot of room to grow and perfect their sound, this probably isn't the best they're capable of but it's a very well-rounded effort. I recommend it to anyone looking for decent industrial metal- fans of Ministry, Fear Factory, Strapping Young Lad, and Devin Townsend.
