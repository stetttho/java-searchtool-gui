 I could go on and say stupid stuff like 'heaviest band ever' or 'most technical band ever' but that would be stupid.  There's always something more technical and there's always something heavier.  Technical skill doesn't always light my fire, all I    ask is that the muscians be able to play their instruments, both live and in the studio.  But I would say that this stuff is pretty heavy, the guitars have a very satisfying processed crunch to it and they just chug right along.  Jens scream/yell goes well with the music, sometimes I'd think he'd do well to incorporate a different vocal style because his vocals might get stale to some though it didn't bother me.  The only complaint I have about this album is that the drums sound too quiet, like they were recorded with the drummer in the next room.  That was a minor thing to me and didn't prevent me from enjoying Chaosphere.  I'd suggest Downloading Corridor of Chameleons or New Millenium Cyanide Christ.  If you like either of those songs buy the album, it is more of the same.
