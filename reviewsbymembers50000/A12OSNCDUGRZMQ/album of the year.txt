 Velvet Cacoon play their own unique brand of black metal influenced music.  The music is usually fast and hypnotic backed by drums that move like a racing heartbeat.  When it isn't going fast, the music slows down to a sigh and ventures into clear channel bliss like the speed of fog(it can get slow which is good).  The production sounds like it was recorded in a giant tank of water.  It has a really clean, aquatic sound.  I haven't heard a band that really sounds like this, though I think Filosefum era Burzum is somewhat similar in style they are two different bands.  I strongly suggest you pick this up if you are into black metal like Burzum or Drudkh and even if you aren't.
