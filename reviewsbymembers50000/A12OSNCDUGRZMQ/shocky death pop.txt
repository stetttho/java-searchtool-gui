 like manson himself said, this is essentially a pop album.  which it is.  it's catchy, it's simple but it's very well-written.  i think part of the reason people think this album is so great is because of it's mystique.  at this time, manson was at the peak of his controversial thingy he had going.  everyone hated him or loved him and everyone was talking about him.  so that made this that much better.  but the music can stand on it's own even without the controversy, even though i feel it adds a lot.  no real music fan who knows what music is would really call this stuff metal.  it has a bit of a metal feel to it but everyone knows there's heavier and better stuff out there more deserving of the title.  and there's more controversial stuff to.  just look into anything death/black metal or gangsta rap or whatever.  there's worse stuff i know.  but i guess i should talk about the music at some point.  the music is catchy, the lyrics are well-written and every song has some sort of theme or feel or point that manson is trying to make.  in those respects every song stands on its own.  it's a weird thing to describe and i'm feeling lazy right now so i'll just say, if you like 'beautiful people', 'tourniquet', and 'deformography', there's no reason why you shouldn't like this.  if you don't, whatever.
