 i love this band.  i don't know why, i don't even listen to pop that much.  that's why i only give it four stars so as to stay somewhat true to my avant-garde roots.  but this band rules!  it's a great blend of eighties synth-pop, garbage, no doubt, and new order.  and it features the drummer from snot(he plays guitar/synthesizers/some bass/lots of stuff)! but this is nothing like snot, though i like some of snot's work. you can't go wrong with 'deadfall'. and yeah, aimee echo sings but i know squat about her and human waste project.  i just know she sang on 'burgundy' by coal chamber.  she can have a very pretty voice, sometimes slightly raspy but you hardly notice.  give her time, she should get way better. i hope.  God i hope this band isn't a one album kind of pony, cuz i think this could only get better with time.  but if they're not, i'll try not to act surprised and just enjoy shakedown! as much as possible.  this album usually keeps a very upbeat feel throughout, except for the occasional 'depressing; riff.  but it's ok cuz the songs are so good. i thought this kind of band died in 95 or something.  we finally have a good pop band again!  go buy this!
