 for the most part, i swear, this album is not all that great. the only good songs on this album are bloody roots, attitude, dusted, jasco, and dictatorsh!t. those are good tunes with attitude being my favorite because the lyrics are so simple yet so good. i'd give this album two stars but i like attitude too much and max cavalera has one of the greatest screams in metal. simply put, max has a great voice. he's probably one of my favorite vocalists. you just gotta love it when he starts screaming 'can you take it?'. but then, if i love max so much, why the low rating? because this album sounds too damn much like korn. aside from the vocals, this album sounds like korn with max screaming, and tribal instruments and percussion in place of the bagpipes, but used a whole lot more often. i used to like korn, but that was when i was a freshman or so. now it bores me. simple drop d metal songs, although i have always been a fan of max's lyrics because they can hold a lot of truth to them. powerful stuff. but whatever. like i said, the best songs are the ones i listed. they don't really sound like korn. but i still don't like this album that much. it's best to see these guys live, because that's where the real power is. and one other thing. the almighty mike patton sings on this record! that should make it reason enough to buy, but no. that song actually isn't that great(also features jon davis)and mike doesn't even play that big a part in the song so it's almost like he's not even there. oh well. by now, this is nothing new. but max does have a great voice. i'll give you that.
