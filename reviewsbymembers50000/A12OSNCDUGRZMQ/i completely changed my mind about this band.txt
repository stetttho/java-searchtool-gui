 for whatever reasons, my tastes in music keep changing in ways that i no longer listen to most of the bands i used to.  system would be one of those bands.  i used to like their first effort quite a bit... so i bought this without hesitation.  at first, i guess i liked it a lot.  but now, i realize that it didn't stand the test of time. i saw them live twice, and i concluded that daron malakian just annoys the hell out of me and really needs to shut up and play the solo from 'soil' recognizably.  i'm quite sick of system of a down now.  maybe it's because i keep getting into older, more respectable bands.  maybe it's because as i delve deeper into the world of music i see where the timeless classics are.  system won't be one of those bands.   though they'll probably be up there in the numbers though when VH1 does a top 100 nu metal bands. from what i've gathered, system of a down borrows heavily from dead kennedys and faith no more and uses the 'influence'(or whatever you want to call it), and makes something trendy that lots of little kids are into these days(nu-metal, or 'metal' that the general public can bob their head to).  they do it well.  but the trouble with trendy music is that it's not challenging at all.  when i listen to this album, i don't hear anything 'new' or 'different' or 'thought provoking' or 'wacky/creative', i just hear something i know i've heard before and it's not as good.  it's like pop music, but with more distortion.  lacksidaisical, happy go lucky, 'catchy', danceable/moshable, non threatening in any way. but a couple million teenagers that haven't really lived life because they're so young can't be wrong, can they?  they know what's up, right? they KNOW 'good' music when they hear it... sure.... if you would like to hear something a little more provocative and heartfelt check out the Dead Kennedys.  it's not as 'heavy'(cuz it's punk you knave), but it's definately a more enriching listening experience.
