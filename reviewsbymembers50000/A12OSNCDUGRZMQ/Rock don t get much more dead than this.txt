 rock is so dead.  and it's been dead for quite some time...  why won't it stay dead?  every bad review here hit the nail on the head, especially the guy who called this anti-art.  he is absolutely right that art can enrich culture and society. he/she is so right, i would love to shake your hand.  creed is the pinnacle of everything that is wrong with today's music and entertainment(though i hate staind almost as much).  creed tears down our culture(as do many other bands like staind, nu-metal, anything mainstream put out in the last five or six years).  there is a drought of creativity.  no one cares about substance, conviction, or meaning anymore.  what happened to people that actually cared about the stuff they created, like RATM, kurt cobain, smashing pumpkins, and all the old great rock legends?what more can you say?  thank God there's an underground music scene...
