 is how i felt after listening to this.  it's an amazing little album.  it left me feeling disgusted, ponderous, and ultimately worn out thinking 'i need a break'.  if i didn't just get back from band practice, this would probably fire me right up. i was reading along with the lyrics and that is quite a lot of information to take in(100 songs in less than half an hour??? ...).  randall and co. discuss lots of weird little issues and you can make of them what you want, some of them seem pretty heady.  the music is just like their previous stuff, only faster and noisier although there are some real catchy riffs and licks(as far as ANb goes).  the only parts that got on my nerves were the 'hungry homeless handjob' type interludes where a processed voice says a line or two for about twelve tracks.  i suppose if i was under the influence of something that would seem a lot more interesting. overall, i'm kind of glad i bought it because this disc is something else. it seems much more carefully thought out like they had an actual vision than an album like prosthetic cxxx's FYDWAFVFS.  very interesting indeed, an overwhelming listening experience.  it's more than enough grindcore to last you for a while. me, i'm going to take a break and listen to some robert rich because my nerves are shot.
