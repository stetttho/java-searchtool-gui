 yeah.. i've been a weezer fan for some time, both previous albums are great in all respects.  it's like the law of the universe that everyone likes those albums.  i was all about getting the new weezer and eagerly looked forward to this thing.  i figured they're the kind of band that just gets better with age because they're all such great song writers/musicians. but no.  i heard 'hash pipe' and i knew, even then, deep within the recesses of my brain i couldn't stand the song because it was horrible.  i just really didn't want to admit what i really thought.  i tried to force myself to like it because it was the first thing i've heard from weezer in five years.  then i bought the album, despite the awful bittersweet 'hash pipe'.  thankfully, hash pipe is the only song on there of it's kind.  as for the rest of the album, it is nothing but Rivers seriously trying to make up for the so-called blunder Pinkerton.  he is just really trying to sell lots and lots of records with this one.  simple, uninspired song structures, simple calculated riffs made to format the record comanies specifications no doubt. a very bad album from a very good band.  let's hope Rivers gets over what everyone but his fans calls a dismal flop(Pinkerton) and decides to start writing songs for himself, the band, and the fans.   in the meanwhile, i am still looking forward to future efforts.   still a fan.  just let down and hanging around, so to speak..
