 it's not nearly as fast or as heavy as these reviews have implied.  it's about average speed for a death/black/whatever metal band.  cephalic carnage, meshuggah, SYL, and all them are heavier.  faster bands would be some stuff by slayer, pig destroyer, etc... not that berzerker isn't heavy nor fast, they are. just not like what you'd expect judging from these reviews.   anyway...  this band is really cool cuz i've been looking around for a good industrial/thrash/black metal hybrid sound with an emphasis on industrial.  ultimately i'd like to find a really dynamic and epic black metal sound comprised wholly of industrial instruments and sounds.  i imagine the resulting sound would be chaotic and really really noisy.  so far, this is as close as i've come(though bomb20, mr. bungle, and merzbow somewhat satiate my need to hear fierce grating noise).   if you took fear factory, added shrieking and growling vocals, replaced the drummer with a drum machine, lots of well-placed samples, sped it up a bit, and added other 'industrial' machine noise, you'd get berzerker.  the only problem i have with this album is that i think the lyrics could've been better, the guitars could've sounded more 'hectic'(think cephalic carnage, or cradle of filth's midian) and the constant double-bassing and grinding of the drum machine can sound a little stale.  these are minor setbacks however, since the overall sound is pretty 'fresh', or at least it is to me.  an interesting buy, but download first(try 'burnt') to be safe and make sure it's your thing.
