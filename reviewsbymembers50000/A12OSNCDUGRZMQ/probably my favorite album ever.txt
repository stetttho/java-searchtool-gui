 the album is three songs, full length.  there are probably 3 riffs or so on the whole album.  some may think: 'that's stupid it's probably boring' and to them, it probably would be. so why do i like it so much? for one, it's quite possibly the heaviest 'music' i've ever heard. 2- the sounds on the disc are incredibly hypnotic. 3- after listening to this record for any period of time i really feel cleansed in some way.  it helps to clear my head.  listening to it allows me to filter out everything else and just relax.  it's like therapy, i can think of no other albums that have this effect on me.  some come close, but they clutter up the equation with unnecessary sounds like vocals, drums, or hooks, or too many sounds in general.  earth keeps it real simple with just guitar, bass, and minor percussion on the last track.  this album is like the most pleasantly sedated state you could be in put to tape.  listen to the samples, the songs are like that with occasionaly tempo changes from slow to earth-like speed only 20 minutes longer.  i'd recommend the album to anyone who enjoys sounds as much as they enjoy music.  edit: after listening to this album many more times and paying much more attention, there are WAY more than 3 riffs.  there are loads of changes, fluxuations, and extra tracks(from what i hear 17 guitar and 2 bass tracks) layered throughout the album.  you are getting a lot of music if you purchase this.
