 this band is awesome... this is probably my first real experience with grindcore other than cephalic carnage, though i don't really consider them grind anyway.   this is short, sweet, music made for absolute gonzo moshing.  often times, the guitars and bass remind me of sped-up PanterA or Sepultura riffs but it's a very different experience.  i especially love the snare. it sounds like a dodgeball being bounced off the ground at grindcore speed.  this sound is especially prevalent on 'sheet metal girl'.   pig destroyer has energy to spare too.  it's all out..., screamy vocals. and it never gets old.  the songs have so many changes within them that by the time you've listened to four songs or so, you've already heard more than an entire staind or any mainstream rock band's ALBUM would have to offer. and that would only be about five/six minutes of music!  even though the music is fast and changes often, you follow it and eat it up. all songs on this album are enjoyable. my favorites would have to be: scatology homework, trojan whore, evacuating heaven, tickets to the car crash, sheet metal girl, murder blossom(the delayed distorted screams are most trippy), and snuff film at eleven.  This is a great piece of work. buy it or something.
