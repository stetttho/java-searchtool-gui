 deftones used to be one of my favorite bands.  i still like them but not as much as i used to. not nearly as much.  though that's not to say that this isn't a bad album. it's not bad at all.  this is  probably the best band out there in what i call, the 'popmetal' category.  the music sounds inspired, it is very melodic and can even be easy to listen to despite all the distortion pedals. start off listening to 'be quiet and drive', i feel it is a very powerful, almost 'epic' sounding piece.  the best combination of catchy riffs, singing and primal screams.  chino has a very pretty voice, a cure-like singing style.  this kind of band started to really take off once korn was getting big.  deftones kind of started out the same way.. like a korn wannabe band on adrenaline. that album had a lot of potential, i feel, but it felt very choppy to me. if it was redone in the very proffesional 'white pony' kind of way, it would be a great album(adrenaline, not around the fur).  the sound quality wasn't that great, though it wasn't terrible. the mixes could've been done better. around the fur sounds like they've grown as a band and learned how to play a lot better since their debut.  they play with each other, instead of against each other.  this is a very melodic album, they accomplish what saliva could never do, the band saliva desperately wants to be.  but the melody comes mostly from chino's voice. occasionally, the band takes towards a more 'hardcore/punk' style of writing riffs on songs like lhabia, rickets, and lotion.  but it's broken up by chino when he stops screaming and starts singing.  the whole thing works very well.  but after a while it all starts to sound the same. i think that sums this thing up rather well. not bad though.. just not into that kind of music anymore.
