 well here it is, the new Electric Wizard.  I thought dopethrone was an amazing piece of pyschedelic doom sludge as were most of their previous releases.  Electric Wizard shake things up on the new album with a few new twists.  A couple of things I noticed was that the production is a bit different.  Not quite as spacey as dopethrone or supercoven, everything sounds much clearer I think except for the vocals.  They are all but intelligible, (maybe more distorted and 'in with the mix' than on dopethone, they also sound less 'tortured' if ask me) but that's not the point with EW.  They're there to guide the music and meld with the rest of the instruments to create one smooth musical landscape.  Which they do rather well.  A few songs worth mentioning are U chosen few(a good classic EW song, filled with solid riffs), We the Undead(this song will surprise you. it's almost 'fast'), Night of the Shape(piano and sax on this song!)and the Priestess of Mars.  I'd say these songs are the highlights of the albums.  I enjoy listening to them, but it's a different feel from dopethrone.  It's not as nearly 'doomy', the material has an altogether more upbeat feel to it and reminds me of Goatsnake(who are awesome as well).  It's a good album, but there are few songs that really rise to the level of older tunes like I the witchfinder, Funerapolis, Wizard in Black, and Supercoven.  Ah, what am I saying, no it's all good.  It just has a slightly different formula and feel than their previous work and it turned out to be a solid album, though not my favorite.  Regardless though I'll be spinning this disc a lot because there aren't a whole ton of bands(to my knowledge anyway) that create a spacey, doom-laden atmosphere like Electric Wizard and the fact that it doesn't suck is a plus too. If you liked this album a lot, I'd suggest getting Goatsnake's Flower of Disease.
