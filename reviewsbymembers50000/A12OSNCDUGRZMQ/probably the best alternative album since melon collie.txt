 maynard made a great move with this band. he wholely puts his nice voice to use with this  band and doesn't sound like a pretentious douchebag MOST of the time(like incubus' brandon boyd who seems to think he's mike patton).  the lyrics are well written, and i'd put them on par with aenima's lyrics cuz i liked those as well(and i consider  tool alternative hard rock so i believe comparisons can be made). a perfect circle has a nice, dreamy, friendly musical landscape and it makes you happy to hear such well composed music like this.  it's like a darker, 'edgier'(what a word), version of smashing pumpkins' machina but this is way catchier and you've got maynard on vocals.  you've most likely already heard 3 libras or judith or the hollow on the radio, if you like that , buy this.  everything else is just as good.  the only tracks that aren't as good as the rest are sleeping beauty(but the solo makes up for it), thomas, and i'd say thinking of you.  but that's cuz i'm one picky jerk and i like music with a lot of changes. most people won't complain, unless you're a diehard tool fan and by listening to tool you're too 'hardcore' for this. if you're like that, get over yourself, tool aren't that hard, and at least give this a listen.  it's a very pleasant experience. the only thing that annoys me about this album is that maynard just had to put a song on here where he tells a god he doesn't believe exists 'fxck you' over and over(judith). good song though, but he could give the god-bashing a rest.  it's about as annoying as hearing sully say 'get away' on every cut of his albums or hearing aaron lewis whine about insecurity.  BUT judith is still a good song despite that.. if you like this i would also suggest buying failure's fantastic planet.
