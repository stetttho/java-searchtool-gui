 this album is everything anyone could possibly want in music.  it's fast, angry, soothing, melodic, ugly, translucent, bubbly, epic, dark, moody, goofy, very lighthearted in a way but never loses it's edge.  this is probably my favorite album of all time.  it combines so many elements from so many different styles of music i love, most notably speed metal, bits of techno, classical, happy-go-lucky fifties type stuff(chemical marriage, merry go byebye), pure ambiance(the bends).  there isn't a song on here i don't like.  it's so musically diverse, it can sound satisfying no matter what kind of mood you are in.  when you first listen to it, i suggest you begin with 'desert search for techno allah' and 'violenza domestica'. the latter is like a conversation being held between an angry italian father and his family, but you only hear his side of the conversation(it's all in italian).  the music accompanies the mood and heightens the emotions as the arguments escalate, it flows together in a very unusual way. that particular tune uses bits of piano, jew's harp, accordian, ambient noise, and other assorted instruments.  i think that song pretty much encompasses the entire mood of the album rather effectively. with the excetpion of 'the bends'. the bends is about nine minutes or so of ambiance that isn't written in any kind of usual song structure(none of the songs really are), rather the music tries to describe a scene and the feelings of some character who apparantly falls out of a boat and experiences something weird to say the least.  this is a great album for anyone who genuinely likes music(you should know who you are), keep an open mind while listening to it.
