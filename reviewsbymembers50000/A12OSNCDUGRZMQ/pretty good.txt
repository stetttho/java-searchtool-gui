 not exactly what i was hoping for but good nonetheless. i was expecting really slow doom metal, but as i was told there were some good bits of stoner rock in here.  this thing is equal parts doom, sludge and stoner and reminds me of a couple bands, namely black sabbath(of course) and the melvins.  lee dorian's voice even reminds me of king buzzo when he's yelling.  pretty thick when it's distorted(where it reminds me most of the melvins), the doom parts kill, and then there's a nice mix of acoustic and quiet parts.  good album, nice mix but i'm gonna have to go buy forest of equilibrium and their earlier works.  not slow enough ..
