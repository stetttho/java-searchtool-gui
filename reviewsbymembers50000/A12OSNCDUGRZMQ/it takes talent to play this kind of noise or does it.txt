 this album sounds like someone took all the instruments a warner bros. cartoon sound fx/composer guy uses and pushed them all down a huge flight of stairs.  then a very talented jazz/deathmetal band plays to it, while mike patton makes lots of weird noises.  buy it if you like experimental stuff or just like to ... off your mainstream buddies who are too closeminded to appreciate why mike patton is so ... good at what he does.
