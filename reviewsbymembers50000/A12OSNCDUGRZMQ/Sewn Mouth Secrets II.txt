 This is like a continuation of Sewn Mouth Secrets.  More of the same pretty much, but definately just as good(though not exactly better).  They took out some of the weird, electronic noises(like at the beginning of It Was Just An Accident), but that's not really a problem.  I think this album sounds slightly catchy to me than SMS.  Some of the riffs just stand out more, and reminiscient of Black Sabbath.   If you haven't heard Soilent Green before, imagine a heavily Black Sabbath influenced Pantera that plays a special blend of death and grind with some sludgy breakdowns(and no solos).  Lots and lots of riff changes.  That description might be a little misleading, so listen to the stuff for yourself then decide. My favorite tracks would be the slow-jam Later Days, Swallowhole, and Last One in the Noose.
