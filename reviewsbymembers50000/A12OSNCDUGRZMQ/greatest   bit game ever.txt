 it's got everything.  sounds like contra, plays like mega man, metroid and zelda ii.  he sounds similar to mario when he jumps. you blast a lot of stuff.  music and stages are played like a cartoon show from about that era.  oh yeah, and it's hard like that too. i died a lot.  i can't really complain, this is about as classic as it gets for me.
