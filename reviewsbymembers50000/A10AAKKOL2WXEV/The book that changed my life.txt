 I started on this diet 18 months ago and boy, what a difference.    I am sharper, brighter, more alive, better at my work, more energetic, can eat as much as I like, suffer no ill health or pain and discomfort...I could go on all day but I think you get the idea. This book is not a diet fad, it is a life changer.    You may think that a book talking about fresh fruit and vegetables, air, water, sunshine and exercise is just common sense. Well you would be right, it is. Unfortunately with all the different opinions we receive from doctors, health advisers and food companies it is easy to get confused about what we should eat.    I would suggest trying this diet for 10 days and see how you feel. I suspect you will notice an improvement in well being very quickly and any way the money you spend on the book will be paid back by a lower grocery bill (fresh produce is cheaper than cooked or processed). What have you got to lose?  After a few months of following the principles in Fit for Life, I would strongly recommend reading Fit for Life II by Harvey and Marilyn Diamond.    Well done Harvey and Marilyn Diamond for having the courage to speak the truth, and thank you.
