 Following the Fit for Life series of books in the 80's and 90's we can now see a mellower, more philosophical and spiritual Harvey Diamond in 2003, quoting from Tolstoy and Voltaire.  The message in the book is basically the same as his previous books but the style is more relaxed and contemplative. He has come to the conclusion that even though he may know the cure for virtually all illness, not everyone wants to listen because the cure is too easy and not complicated enough.  If you have not read the Fit for Life books (Fit for Life, Fit for Life II and Fit for Life: A New Beginning), I would recommend reading these first. They are the originals and still the best at describing the principles you need to follow. However, this is still a good book for those who want further reading.
