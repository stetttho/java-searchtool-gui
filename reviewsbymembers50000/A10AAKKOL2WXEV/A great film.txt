 This is a great film which gives us a good portrayal of Gandhi's life and achievements.  The film portrays Gandhi as an honest, hard working and kind individual who always tried to do the right thing, even when facing overwhelming resistance.  If you like the film I would suggest reading his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth, which will give you an insight into his mind.
