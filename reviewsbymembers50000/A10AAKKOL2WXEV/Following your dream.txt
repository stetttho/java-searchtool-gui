 This is a fable about following your dream and chosen path.    The film is based on a young stable lad who rode a racehorse, called Archer, nearly 600 miles across Australia to enter the 1862 Melbourne Cup. On his journey the boy is helped by a spiritual force, which shows itself through signs and fateful coincidences. This force not only guides him to his goal but also sets tests for him along the way, therefore developing his wisdom, intuition and strength of character.    I was enlightened by the fact that some of his tests (or work) en route to his dream were actually more important than realising the dream itself.
