 The story of a man who died at just 33 years of age sticking up for truth, love and nonviolence, while speaking out against greed, envy and hate.  Most people in the world have heard of him (whatever their religious background) and the story has stood the test of time.  This is a film not just for the Christian religion (which unfortunately has been stained with blood over the last 2000 years) but a film for all who believe in a force not of this world, enlightenment and love for your fellow man.  A great film, a great story and truly a great man.
