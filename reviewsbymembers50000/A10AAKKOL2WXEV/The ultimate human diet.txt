 Herbert M. Shelton, who ran a health school between 1928 and 1981, is the most respected and knowledgeable Natural Hygienist of recent times.  In this book he explains the teachings by other Natural Natural Hygienists over the last 200 years. This book serves to provide credit for these original pioneers and their writings.  The Natural Hygiene movement, which started in 1830, uses the basic laws of nature to find the best diet for humans. The movement gave rise to veganism in the 1970's and some five star Natural Hygiene lifestyle books, such as Harvey and Marilyn Diamond's Fit for Life series in the 1980's.  By following the Natural Hygiene principles you will discover that your body is a self-maintaining and self-healing system who's natural lifespan is between 120 to 150 years old. These detoxifying principles are also a key starting point on the path to enlightenment, spiritual awareness and following your destiny in life.  A keen student of the principles was Gandhi, who was always experimenting with his diet (see his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth). In his later years he finally became a fruitarian, the ultimate holistic diet.
