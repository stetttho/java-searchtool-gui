 This is a story of one man's search for truth and the meaning of life. We join him on his journey as he experiences a series of key spiritual insights.  In the book we are told that the insights were found in an ancient Peruvian manuscript. The manuscript maybe fiction, however the insights are true. How do I know? Well I too have experienced them and this happened before I read the book.  The nine insights to experience are:  1) Becoming aware of the "coincidences" in one's life. 2) Experiencing a heightened understanding of world history and Man's evolution. 3) Becoming aware that all living things have energy fields. 4) Becoming aware that people try to steal other people's energy, creating conflict. 5) Realising that it's not about you. 6) Becoming aware that you have a dream and a destiny to fulfil. 7) Becoming aware that many of your thoughts and actions are guided. 8) Realising that other people sometimes provide the answers that you seek. 9) Understanding that Mankind is on a journey towards living in perfect harmony with each other and nature, as our world evolves over the next 1,000 years into an Eden-like paradise.  If you have not experienced these insights and would like to, it really is very easy. Just follow the steps on feeltheforce.org. Before I was blind and now I can see.  Good luck and God bless.
