 The Diamonds wrote this book (also known as Living Health) in the 80's and it is has stood the test of time. It is not only just as important a piece of literature now as it was then, but I believe it will also be in 100 years time. The fact that a diet book has lasted this long is a great testimony, as after all, the truth does not obey time and will always win through in the end (however much it is critised by others).  I purchased this book after reading their first book, Fit for Life. I can recommend these Fit for Life books for anyone who is seeking more energy, cure from illness, lower weight, improved health and also, spiritual awareness.  Don't worry the book is religion free. However a side effect of following the principles is that after several months you should start to experience positive spiritual insights and foresights.  This awareness has also been experienced by friends of mine who have followed the principles plus Harvey Diamond (he writes about it briefly in his book Fit for Life A New Beginning), James Redfield (Celestine Prophecy), Paulo Coelho (The Alchemist) and Mahandas Karamchand Gandhi (The Story of My Experiments with Truth).  Special note 1: Keep away at all costs from Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil or Fat (it takes 3 days to pass through my system and absolutely saps me of energy in the process - it is a hidden killer from the unscrupulous food industry and can do as much harm as heroin).  Special note 2: Keep away from mobile phones unless used with a Bluetooth headset (when I was on the phone for over an hour a day the radiation from my mobile phone sapped me of energy, sometimes for days until I added the Bluetooth).  Special note 3: If you are a smoker, I would strongly recommend Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking. It will set you free.  Good luck and God bless.
