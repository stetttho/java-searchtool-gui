 This is a great book with Harvey at times unleashing his full venom at the medical profession, food industry and fellow dieticians. He is speaking up for the truth and I happen to believe him. Why? Because I have tested and followed the Fit for Life principles myself and they work.    However before reading this book, I would advise buying and following the principles laid out in the first two books i.e. Fit for Life and Fit for Life II. They are easier to read, gentler (probably because they were written in partnership with Marilyn!) and cover the essential dietary/lifestyle principles you need to follow.      This book contains virtually the same text as Fit for Life: A New Beginning, so if you want to save yourself some money I would buy that one instead. I would have rated the book 5 stars, if it was not for this point.
