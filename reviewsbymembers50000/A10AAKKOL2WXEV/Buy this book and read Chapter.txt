 Feeling down, stuck in a dead end job or just think you have more to give? Well you have found the right book.  Chapter 10 covers changing your diet to improve performance. I tell you it works. I started on it 18 months ago and I am a different person.  I am brighter, sharper, more alive, better at my work....I could go on all day but I think you get the idea.  I have learnt over these last months that in order to succeed over a long period of time, you require superb energy levels and good mental health. The fuel for this comes from a good diet. Don't believe me, try it for yourself, what have you got to lose? I suspect that within 10 days you will notice a change in well being and performance levels.  You may be surprised at what he says is good and bad for you. It certainly goes against conventional attitudes you hear from most doctors, health professionals and food companies.  Before I was blind and now I can see.  Another book worth buying is Fit for Life by Harvey and Marilyn Diamond, which goes into more detail on the subject.
