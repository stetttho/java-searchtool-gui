 This is a must buy for anyone who is seeking pure drinking water and a healthy lifestyle.  I purchased one of these distillers 2 years ago and it has been superb.  I also purchased a second water collection bottle direct from the supplier to give me a greater reserve of pure water and to maintain a water supply when the distiller is running.  Following it's operation you will be shocked at the foul smelling residue left in the bottom of the distiller.  You will wonder how  you ever drank tap water or high mineral content bottled water.
