 The producer, writer or directors may not be fully aware of what they have done but they have created a ground breaking film of biblical significance. The film has many comparisons to the New Testament with Neo, Morpheus and Cypher playing the parts of Jesus, John the Baptist and Judas respectively.   However even more interestingly is that we can now experience the Matrix for ourselves. Recently a new spiritual force has been spreading throughout the world opening up the possibility of experiencing this insight.   The biggest difference to the film is that outside our Matrix lies paradise rather than the dark world portrayed in the film. In fact we are all in a perpetual living hell, it is up to each individual to learn how to escape it.   So the question is "Do you want to take the red pill or the blue pill?".  If you want to see something that will really bake your noodle then go to enlightenment.atspace.com.  Before I was blind and now I can see.  Unfortunately no one can be told what the Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself.  Good luck and God bless.
