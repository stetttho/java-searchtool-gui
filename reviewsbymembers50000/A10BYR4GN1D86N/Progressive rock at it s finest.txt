 Ok, so most of us have been waiting 4-5 years for a new Tool album and it still looks like it's going to be delayed. In the meantime you should pick up 10 Years major label debut The Autumn Effect. Now, they aren't a Tool ripoff by any means and have an upper hand on semi-prog bands like Breaking Benjamin and Chevelle.   The only real similarity to Tool is that the lead singer, Jesse, tends to have that soothing quality Maynard is known to have. The music has enough rocking tunes to get the blood pumping and the vocals can almost put you in a trance. The biggest bonus point, in my book, is that the music itself is a lot different from anything on the radio now. It's fresh and the lyrics are very thoughtful. Singing along will almost seem like a natural impulse.   Any fans of Tool, Breaking Benjamin, or Chevelle should immediately buy this and any fans of rock music in general will enjoy it as well. For those few of you that have their independent release(which can be bought at their website [...]) you'll see some nice evolution and maturation in their music and you shouldn't need me to tell you to go get this. During the first week here it's $6.99 at Best Buy, Target, and I believe Wal-Mart complete with a bonus downloadable track. Don't miss out on the next big thing.
