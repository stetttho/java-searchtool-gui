 I must say, I'm a relatively new Foo Fighters fan. I joined in on One By One with the big hits All My Life and Times Like These and loved the album. I know it's not a diehard fan favorite but it's certainly not bad music. Now with this album I'm even more impressed with the Foo Fighters. So much so that I've worked on getting their three previous albums before One By One. If you are a new fan like myself, you'll love this album and no doubt be enticed to buy the others. If you're a die hard fan then you'll love this albums polish and great variety of songs.   Dave Grohl has certainly done well here. He does what he does best on the rock album with his rough voice and pounding lyrics. On the acoustic album he shows he can do more than just rock out and the special guests fit wonderfully. I won't make any sort of reference to Nirvana here because both he and the Foo Fighters should be put in their own category. This is Grade A Foo loving material here and no one should take that away from Dave or the band. I can't wait to see what other singles they pull out and if they make another funny music video with Jack Black and the like. Shell out the money for this one folks, it's going to be a classic.
