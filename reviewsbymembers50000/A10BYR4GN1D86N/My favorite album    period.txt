 I'm something of a new Pearl Jam fan. I have their first four albums and I'll be getting Yield soon enough. Of the four I own my favorite song ever comes off Vs. and this is my favorite PJ CD. Maybe that'll change with Yield but right now I can only speak of the present.  Back to my favorite song of not only the CD but anything I've heard. That honor would go to Rearviewmirror. No matter how many times I listen to this song it gives me the chills at the climax. The funny thing is I'm big on guitar solos and this song actually doesn't have one. It seems like a rather simple song but there's real beauty here. Eddie builds up the song and right around the last half of it he just explodes and I feel the goosebumps pop all over my arms.  Aside from that song there's much more good stuff on here. The only one I have a habit of skipping is Rats because it's just kind of quirky and I only listen to it when I have time. This album really builds off of what they did in Ten and you can see how they started changing here. Eddie does an excellent job and Mike has those memorable solos. Another one of my favorite songs in Leash. Probably the hardest song they've done and I can't get enough of it. The last song, Indifference, is a really strong slow song that can grip your heart if you are in the right mood.  Basically, if you enjoyed Ten you need to pick this up and continue your Pearl Jam journey. If you are looking for a first CD I suggest going in order and starting with Ten. This CD is top notch and bands nowadays should take note in how to evolve your music and not become static.
