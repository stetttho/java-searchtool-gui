 The Better Life remains in my top 5 list for favorite albums. Naturally, that's not something easy to top. When I got this back when it was released I was a bit disappointed. It's not a bad CD by any means, but it seems like an encore to The Better Life. There's some songs that really show another direction of their music but most of it feels the same. By that, I mean, the material of the lyrics feels a tad bit repetitive and there seems to be a formula to some of the songs. This album is also softer than The Better Life which was the real turn off. As the years have gone on I've grown more and more in love with heavier music and when I see a band go soft for radio friendly stuff I don't hold the same interest. I guess I was just expecting a rocking continuation of their debut.  Enough with the negative though. There is some real quality songs that have a unique sound to them as I mentioned earlier. Those are: Ticket To Heaven, Changes, Going Down In Flames, and Sarah Yellin'. Those are also the best songs off the album. I'm not a fan of ballads so Here Without You really isn't for me but I know a lot of people out there like it. It is the best ballad they've done so I can say that much. Away From The Sun is the best single they released. Unforutnately it was the last single and didn't get heard much.  When I rate this album I don't take into account how overplayed some songs may be. IMO, that has nothing to do with the band but rather those horrid radio stations out there and a small bit of fans requesting their music repeatedly to get their name out. This gets 3.5 stars specifically because it's a pretty good album for 3DD fans but I like the other two albums more. New 3DD fans should check out The Better Life before venturing Away From The Sun.
