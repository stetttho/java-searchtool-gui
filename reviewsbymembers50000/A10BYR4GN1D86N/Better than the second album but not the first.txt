 I've been a 3DD fan since Kryptonite hit the radio waves back in 1999. As soon as I bought the first album, The Better Life, I was instantly hooked. With the second release of Away From The Sun in 2002 I had slightly mixed reactions. Some songs were real good but then there was some somewhat lacking the feel the first CD had. With their third full length album, Seventeen Days, I have to say they've rebounded a bit. Some songs show the maturity of the band and Brad's voice overall. Particularly in my favorite songs off the CD like Live For Today and My World. If only they could've captured the sound in those two songs and worked on them. Instead there's a few too many similar ballads and I don't even bother listening to Here By Me. You've heard it before on Away From the Sun, as is the case with the subject of the lyrics. Overall there's 8 good songs, 2 average songs that you'll probably end up forgetting about and 2 horrid songs. That's not a bad ratio by any means, but I'm hoping that for the next album they'll spend more than 17 days writing the material. Even though they took over 2 years to get this album out it feels rushed. I'm also hoping they'll come up with something we haven't already heard.
