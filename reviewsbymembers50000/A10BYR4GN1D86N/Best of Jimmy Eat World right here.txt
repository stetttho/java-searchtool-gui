 I'd probably give it 4.5 stars but you get the idea. This is their best album yet and I do own all of them. I started off with Bleed American(self-titled one) and this one even surpassed that. They really built on that album by still rocking out and building on the slow songs that really aren't ballads so much.  One thing I always loved about JEW is that their lyrics were both meaningful and rather hopeful. They weren't depressing like most of the other stuff out there. Even though the content here is darker than on their self-titled album it still has messages of fighting through those tough times. Jim Adkins does an amazing job on vocals and he's gotten better with every release.  Of course, everyone knows the single Pain and as well they should. It's one of the better songs on the album and probably their best single next to Sweetness.  Nothingwrong is probably my favorite song on the album and it's probably the heaviest next to Pain. There's a perfect mix of fast songs(the two mention as well as the album title track Futures) along with slightly slower songs(Just Tonight, Work, Kill, 23) and a very strong slow song Drugs Or Me. Along with the great variety of songs I'm glad to see they've moved away from that punk thing they did with Static Prevails and focused on rocking out (sidenote: they're not emo). They started that with their self-titled CD and continue it here.  To finish, if you are a JEW fan you probably already have this album and don't need me to tell you to go buy it ASAP. If you are somewhat of a new fan or don't know where to start this is as good of a place as any. I'd suggest either this or their self-titled CD before going onto their older stuff. I personally didn't like their first CD and their second one was decent. Here is where they are at their best. Pop the CD in and let the music take over what it's supposed to, your emotions.
