 I like Disturbed's debut CD as an album to listen to when I need to get aggression out. I pop in Believe when I need more melody to go with the hard rock and some more thought provoking lyrics. One thing lead singer David Draiman is good at is strong lyrics that anyone can relate to in their own way. What I may interpret out of such excellent songs as 'Believe' others may not and that's really what Disturbed stands for. Every song on here is a winner with Bound being my favorite. This CD is a must in every hard rock fan's collection as well as metal fans who don't mind some melody between the wails and shrieks.  It should also be said that nu-metal isn't a genre. It's a term created mainly with a negative connotation to bands. I'll admit, there's a lot of bands that sound the same but whether you like it or not they're this generation's rock/hard rock. Disturbed sets themselves apart with Dan's amazing guitar work, Mike's excellent drumming and David's unbelievable vocals/lyrics. They are in a league of their own here.
