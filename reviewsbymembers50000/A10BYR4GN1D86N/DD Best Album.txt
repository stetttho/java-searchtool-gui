 I bought this album when it first came out and I still love it. I'm mainly writing this review to let new fans of 3DD know that this one is still their best. Every song on this track is amazing and still gets routine spins in my CD player. It's also their hardest rocking CD they've put out and it's one every fan should have in their collection.
