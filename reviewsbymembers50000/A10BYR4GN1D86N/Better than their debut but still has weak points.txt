 The main knock I have with Franz Ferdinand's debut was that though every song was catchy and had foot tapping moments, the tempo of all the songs was the same. There were no slower songs thrown into the mix(you can make a case for Auf Acshe) to switch things up or calm down your beating heart. With 'You Could Have It So Much Better' they remedy this problem and that's a big bonus.  Particularly with the slower songs Eleanor Put Your Boots On and Fade Together you see another side of Franz(and one that sounds a bit Beatles-esque no less). These two songs are placed at good points in the album but that weakness still sneaks up a bit. All of the songs pretty much have a catchy beat and it's rarely repetitive. The things that seems to drag a bit is the amount of up tempo songs. This album is only 41 minutes long but it seems to go on longer because of that similarity between some songs.  The first single, Do You Want To, is the best song they've done IMO. Even though it has the same formula as Take Me Out it just has a catchier beat and really gets me moving. It's also the only song that would seem to belong on FF's debut. Other strong songs are The Fallen(one of the best and most unique of theirs), This Boy, Evil And A Heathen, I'm Your Villian, and Outsiders. As you can see, I find the beginning of the album to be really song with it kind of running together during the middle to end. Outsiders is a great way to end the album though, as it's a rather unique song with some of the effects and the overall feel of it.  The bottom line here is if you liked their debut you should love this effort. It's the same Franz you know and love but with some new twists and many new catchy tunes. If you weren't much of a Franz fan but like these retro bands then you still might want to check this out, there's a better amount of variety(though more is still needed). I look forward to seeing where they go from here.
