 Ben Burnley still has the most amazing unique voice I've ever heard next to Joey Culver and Maynard. Quite honestly, his voice makes this band work and it shows in their Sophomore attempt. Naturally, everyone already knows about So Cold so I'll spare you from telling you what you already know. Ben's voice seems to really shine in tracks like "Forget It", "Sooner or Later"(second single) and "Breakdown". There's a track or two here that I don't care much for so that's why it doesn't get the 5 stars. The great thing about these songs, though, is that none of them really sound like anything off of their debut album. They've kept that sound(mainly because of Ben) while changed it up enough to produce something fresh.  For those fans that are new to Breaking Benjamin I recommend getting their debut album, "Saturate" first and then get this one. For those that already have it I say get this as soon as possible. This album is different from Saturate in that it feels more polished and not as raw. In my opinion, this is a double edged sword. I loved the raw sound and power coming off of Saturate but at the same time I love the polished thoughtful sound coming out of We Are Not Alone. Both albums are great and luckily enough, different to make you feel like spending $10+ is more than worth it.
