 Saturate is my most played CD of Breaking Benjamin's. The CD is so much more raw and powerful while keeping that melody. I've had this CD for awhile and I still can't get enough of hard tracks like Medicate, my personal favorite Natural Life, Home, and Phase. All of the songs are great including their hidden track at the end of the last song. If you are looking to get into Breaking Benjamin and don't know where to start then this is the place. Ben's voice can be both soothing and bruising and it's so unique it gives the band a different sound no one else can copy. If you're a fan of Chevelle, Seether, or other bands that combine both melody and screaming in a perfect blend then you'll like what you get here.
