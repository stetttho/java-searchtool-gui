 This was without a doubt the best album of 2004. It's too bad I didn't pick it up until real early this year but this is a solid debut album. Every single song on this album is amazing and memorable. Brent Smith's vocals are probably the best there are out of not only debut bands but any band today. His voice shows well in the rocking songs like In Memory and Burning Bright while showing variety in songs like .45 and the cover, Simple Man.  Debut albums usually make a strong statement about what type of future a band may have and these guys have shown something here. It's one of the best albums I own overall while also being one of the best debut albums I own. There's really something for everyone here as long as your a Rock fan. I really can't think of any band they sound like or compare to. They're their own band with their own sound. Pick this album up ASAP and look forward to their follow-up later this year. The CD also comes with their music videos for Fly From The Inside and .45 so there's bonus content there.
