 Of all the CD's I've bought in the last couple of years, this is probably one of the most original. That is in terms of both sound and content.  To start off, let me just say that Joey Culver, the lead singer, has a most unique voice. I was immediately hypnotized by it and it really lends a hand into their unique sound. At times he sings powerfully and others he can give a very peaceful and soothing sound. The songs themselves are unique from the vocals to the amazing drumming(more on that later) to the lyric content.   Like their name and CD cover suggests, they are fascinated by life outside of this world and aliens in general. Some of the songs kind of cover this theme but you can't help but wonder if there's other meaning behind them. For that they get a bonus point in my book. I mean, how many bands have written a song about Mothra?  As for the drumming, Chad Kent is every bit like his nickname suggests. They call him Superman for a reason folks. His drumming is so fast and insane it almost makes you want to start rapping your fingers as fast as you can on anything around you. Particulary in my 3 favorite songs, Mothra, Agent Orange, and Aliens, he has some real stand out drum solos.   The song from the Punisher soundtrack, Time For People, is what made me buy this album but I was blown away in the end. Get this album immediately and I'll guarantee you'll never regret it. Not a bad song on it and for that it gets a 5/5.
