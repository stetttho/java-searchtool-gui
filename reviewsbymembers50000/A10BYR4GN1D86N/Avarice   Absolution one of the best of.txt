 People say the lead singer reminds them of Velvet Revolver but I never cared for that guys voice and can really get into Revery. This CD is beefed up of some of the finest hard rock music for a debut band. I love 12 of the 13 songs and for many different reasons. For one there's some great rock anthems, my favorite of which is Walk The World. I haven't been to one of their shows yet but I'd assume that one gets the crowd going like no other. Then there's songs with killer guitar solos(Sugar Star has one of my favorite solos ever) including one that seems to be a finale in the last song Which Way To Sunday. Then there's the quarky song like August where the lead singer does something I'd sooner expect to hear in a Disturbed or Sevendust song but he pulls it off very well.  Most of the songs have catchy vocal hooks but the guitar work and overall feel of the songs is pretty much as well put together as a new band could have it. It's one of my favorite debut CD's since Shinedown's Leave A Whisper and Pearl Jam's Ten. This band has a lead guitarist that could carry them to places that average radio bands could only dream of.  There's only two complaints I have that knocks this down to a 4/5 stars. The first is that Penelope has horrible lyrics that remind me of Nickelback. The second is that there's really no slow song(don't mean a ballad) to change the pace a bit. Secondhand Redemption is about as close as you get and even then by the end of the song your rocking out. I look forward to see where they go from here and how they evolve as musicians.
