 If you're a fan of Shinedown it shouldn't be too hard to decide whether or not to buy this. I hadn't had the chance to see these guys in concert so this DVD was a real treat for me. I also definately plan on seeing them once they start touring for their sophomore album 'Us And Them'.  There's a nice bonus interview with all the band members about pretty much everything from touring to their CD to what they are trying to do with their music. It is around 20-30 minutes long and gives you a good idea of who the band really is.  Obviously, the big thing with this is the live concert that covers every song(including Simple Man) except Lacerated and one other.  The concert lasts a little over an hour and there are scenes in between songs with Brent talking and riling up the crowd.   It has to be said that Brent shows an amazing amount of emotion while singing. In the beginning of Simple Man he talks about tragedy and dedicates the song to the late Dimebag Darrell. He's even on the verge of tears while talking and in the middle of the song. It really enhances the experience to what is a beautiful cover to begin with. His voice is just as good as the CD as well. It seems like he needs to warm up a bit at the beginning but he gets going real well. Considering he is one of my top 5 favorite vocalists he did everything as I expected.  In closing, if you're a Shinedown fan this is worth the buy. It's also good to tide you over before the next album hits October 4th.
