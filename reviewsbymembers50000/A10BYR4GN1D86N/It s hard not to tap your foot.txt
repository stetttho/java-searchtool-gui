 I'll be the first to admit that I don't normally listen nor like this type of music. However, something happened when I first heard Take Me Out. That would be the irresistible urge to tap my foot along to the beat. That's pretty much the story of this album. Every song on here is very catchy in their own ways with none sounding like the other.  It's also not only the catchy beats that make the songs addictive but also the vocals of Kapranos are beautifully done. In most songs he also changes the tempo or style of his singing which shows his versatility. The songs themselves appear pretty simple in terms of drums and such but that doesn't stop them from sticking in your head.  The material of the songs usually fit relationships or dance type themes. Everyone should know that the assassination of Franz Ferdinand started World War I and Take Me Out is a song covering that subject rather than the assumed asking someone out. The lyrics can be very deep and symbolic as well as simple in the case of Michael.  Really, if you are a fan of this retro type movement of music you should have this CD in your collection. Even if you aren't, like I wasn't, you should perhaps give this a try in some form or another(be it sampling the 30 sec clips here or buying the CD).
