 I bought this CD after hearing the first four tracks off their Myspace website. The single "Don't Push" got me curious in the first place and Back To The Rebels and Home For An Island finished it off. Those 4 tracks remain the best ones on the CD and the rest of the album had to grow on me. That being said, I still love their other songs. One thing you definately get with The Exit is a CD full of songs unique to themselves. You have the harmonica driven Soldier and So Leave Then is peppered with the Saxophone. Overall I love they created 10 catchy songs that are unique. This type of music wasn't my type of thing until recently and I do not regret buying this. It can be found relatively cheap online but even then I'd pay $15 for it if I had to. If you find your way to their Myspace page and like the 4 tracks then this CD is for you.
