 A friend of mind told me to check out his favorite band about over a year ago. I had only heard a few of their singles(like most everyone) and enjoyed them but never really listened. He told me to start off with Ten and work my way up to Riot Act so I can experience the band's growth like the fans from the beginning did. I have to say, that's the best advice I could give anyone who wants to check Pearl Jam out. If you want to get into Pearl Jam this is the best place to start.  First of all, you probably know their main songs like Evenflow, Jeremy, and Black. Those are great songs, though a tad bit overplayed even now, and Alive remains as my second favorite PJ song. The guitar solo at the end lasts for over a minute and it gives me the chills every time.  Rest assured, though, those aren't the only good songs. 'Once' is a great opener and it's a part of the Alive song trilogy. 'Why Go' is excellent as well and also has a nice short little solo that gets the blood pumping. After Jeremy the CD puts you on a roller coaster of both slow and fast paced songs. The last song, Release, is certainly a very soothing song that makes you feel the emotions PJ is putting forth.  The lyrical content throughout this CD is certainly thought provoking and Eddie Vedder does an amazing job singing. He is, without a doubt, my favorite singer of any band. This CD is a classic and should be in any rock fans collection. Though it's not my favorite PJ album it is up at the top of the list. There is no bad song and at a day and age where most music sounds the same this can come as a breath of fresh...err...old air.
