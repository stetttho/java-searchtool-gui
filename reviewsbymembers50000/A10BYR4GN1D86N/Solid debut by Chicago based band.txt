 This CD went multi-platinum for a reason folks. I prefered the CD 'Believe' more than this one but this really sets the stage for Disturbed. Everyone knows this CD best for 'Down With The Sickness' with the 'monkey grunts' or whatnot. This CD is so much more than grunting though.  The material itself is rather dark with songs ranging from violence to abuse and neglect. The guitar and drumming is bruising to go along with the brutal vocals of David. He really sets himself apart from other singers which is welcoming considering all the copycats out there.  This CD is definately much more raw when compared to Believe.  Down With The Sickness is the best song on this CD followed closely by Stupify and The Game. The last half of the CD kind of goes in a different direction with more brutal vocals that jump right out like Droppin' Plates and Meaning of Life.  If you want to get into Disturbed it's really a coin toss on whether you should start with this or Believe. There is definately two different styles, one being more raw and the other being more polished and melodical. Either way, you can't go wrong. Both are great albums even if Believe is a bit better in my opinion.
