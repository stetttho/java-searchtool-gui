 Don't let the fact there's no Parental Advisory tag on this CD fool you. If anything, it helps the beautiful artwork stand out more. This CD is harder than Disclaimer I/II while still being different enough to show that maturity process. With this second album from Seether they show they have what it takes to be around for awhile. They've matured lyrically, vocally, and musically while still retaining that Seether sound we all know and love. Shaun still gets in his fair amount of screams on most every songs and at the right time. Don't go expecting a whole album like Broken because they didn't sell out and that's not what Seether is all about.  Every song on this album is excellent and at nice lengths. The CD comes in at 60 minutes and that's including the bonus track that's a little quirky. If you're a Seether fan you don't need me to tell you to go pick this up because you probably already have. If you just liked a few songs here and there but never got their first albums you need to pick this up. At the very least go to one of their websites, www.seetherville.com, and sample all the tracks. This is a beautiful rock album and should be in everyone's collection. They really are their own band and stand out as such on this album.
