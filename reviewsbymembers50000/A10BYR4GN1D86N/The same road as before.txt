 The main knock on Nickelback has always been that they use the same chords and riffs as well as lyric content. Sure, there's the saying that "If it ain't broke, don't fix it' but there's also the economic law of diminishing returns. Putting out the same basic product every 2 years is only going to work for die hard fans. This CD is perfect for Nickelback fans looking for the encore to Silver Side Up. There's tons of catchy vocal hooks like Chad is known for and even if you find it hard to like Nickelback you have to admit their catchy. The CD's main single, 'Someday', is excellent even if it was overplayed.   They do have some different type of songs but as I've said before, the lyric content about bad relationships or someone losing hope are the same. The last three songs are covers from various bands as well. The album is a solid album but it can get boring or redundant. The real treat, as always, is the vocals. Nickelback fans need to buy this but iffy fans need to go to Silver Side Up.
