 The only Nickelback album I don't own is The State so from what I've heard this is the best album. This was Nickelback's breakout album and the first I owned. 'How You Remind Me' instantly hooked me when I heard it on the radio years ago and that's the story of Nickelback. Chad has to be one of the best vocalists at creating catchy vocal hooks and melodies.   Aside from that song the rest of the CD isn't too radio friendly which is a good thing. The songs still have catchy vocals though, don't get me wrong. For this being Nickelback's third album they've done well to create songs unlike past work. However, you can sense the material is getting a little repetitive both with the riffs and chords used as well as the usual relationship based songs that they seem to love.  Since the songs seem to be about relationships not working the or hope being lost the material certainly has a gloomy quality about it.  Either way, new fans of Nickelback should pick this album up first and if you're sitting on the fence because you like a few singles you should commit and buy this CD.
