 I bought this album a few months ago because of the single The Panic. The lyrics were a big drawing point and the lead singer, Eric, has a very unique voice. I think it's a combination of his voice itself and the speed he sings at. It's not so much the speed of the words and verses but of his pronunciations(which can make some words unclear).  Aside from the uniqueness of the vocals there's also some really sweet riffs. Particularly in Just Like Silk, Today, and When It's All Burning. There's no real guitar solos but it's not necessary. Strata is really a unique band that you don't see too often trying to break from the mold. Pick this CD up if you need something new to check out and there's no new CD's coming around soon. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at what you find. It's really grown on me recently since I revisited it.  It should be said that this band is all about the music and growing as musicians. Expect a new CD next year from them and there's a new demo on their Myspace website. Be prepared for something different because they are evolving and we, as fans, are along for the ride. The best bands change their sound to stand the test of time.
