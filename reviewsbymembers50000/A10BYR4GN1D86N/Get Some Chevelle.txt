 I consider myself a pretty big Chevelle fan. I own all three records and the live DVD they released. That being said, this album is good but I like Wonder What's Next more. That album is in my top 10 of all time CD's. Maybe this one just has to grow on me but it just seems to be missing something. There's definately a different sound here than on WWN and I chalk that up to maturing their sound.  The CD really shines at a few key points of the album. Get Some is my favorite song off this CD. It's got beautiful hooks along with a sweet bridge to tie the song together. Vitamin R was great for a single even if it was played often. Still Running came off the Punisher soundtrack and it was changed a little bit(for the better I might add). My other favorite track is Emotional Drought where Pete has a scream that lasts 10 seconds.  Actually, there is kind of a patter with this CD. The first few songs are real good, the middle kind of drops off and then picks up again with the 8th track Tug-O-War until the album is done. If it was solid all the way through it'd pass up WWN easily. For that I'd give it 4.5 stars if only it were an option. If you are getting into Chevelle I'd say start with Wonder What's Next and then get this CD. They're a solid band and I think they have what it takes to stay around for awhile.
