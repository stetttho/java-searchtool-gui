 Let me start by saying that I've had this CD since last Wednesday, a week before it was released, because I pre-ordered it from their website. Not only did I get it so early but it came with a second CD booklet with all the band members' signatures. That just goes to show how cool these guys really are for starters. Ok, so you don't read reviews to hear about how down to earth bands are. Well, simply put, this CD is amazing.  Twelve Year Silence is a great debut effort from a supergroup such as this. The name of the CD symbolizes how long they have all known each other though it was always in different bands. Some of these are Sevendust, Creed, Stuck Mojo, Doubledrive, Virgos Merlot, Skrape, and others. As you might expect, there's a very fresh sound with all these great minds coming together. Upon opening the booklet you'll see that all the band members are vocalists aside from the instrument they play. There is a very unified feeling about this band and the music in general.  Every song is likable and I find myself skipping over none of them. They don't sound the same either, be it vocally or musically. It should also be said there's some well placed guitar solos, particularly in Heal In Time(my fav), that send chills down my back. They seem to cover all the ground while keeping every song fresh. The first single is powerful and gives a good indication as to how the album will feel. That is, from the deep and thoughtful lyrics to the combined vocals of the band, you feel what they feel and can't help but sing along.  It's hard to say what I can compare this band to other than a little bit of all the bands I mentioned above. Here it molds flawlessly into one creation. Buy this CD and enjoy the ride as we wait to see what they'll do next.
