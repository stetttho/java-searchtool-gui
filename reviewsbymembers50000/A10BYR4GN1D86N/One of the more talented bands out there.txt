 I don't know anything about comparisons to older classic rock bands. My taste in music tends to be more modern and I loved this CD. It might take people some time to get used to the vocals, the long spaces of instrumentals, or the quirky latin beat in some songs.   First and foremost, the guitars are excellent. That's probably the single most important part of music to me aside from the vocals, and both deliever strongly. Particularly in Roulette Dares and Eriatarka you see the band hitting on all cylinders, as well as Televators. The drummer is amazing as well and the album is put together very smoothly without sounding over-produced.  For those, like myself, who long for music with passion not only in the vocals but in the lyrics The Mars Volta is for you. The best song that shows this is my personal favorite, Televators. I don't suppose to try and explain what it means(or any of the songs what with the cryptic lyrics) but at a point near the end of the song there's a great vocal build up that is very captivating. A bonus is the music video you can find on Launch Yahoo. It really seems to capture the mood of the song and the animation gets a story across that's easier to comprehend.  Yeah, sometimes the vocals are hard to understand but then again, I really didn't need to in order to be entertained. The long parts full of sounds and instrumentals aren't bad but can probably get tedious if you aren't a patient listener. I'm just glad to see some refreshing music hit the scene in a market flooded by clone after clone. This CD, and more importantly the band, are really a hit and miss. There seems to be a great deal more people that can appreciate something that's not cookie-cutter radio rock and can understand that TMV is out to make music and enjoy themselves.
