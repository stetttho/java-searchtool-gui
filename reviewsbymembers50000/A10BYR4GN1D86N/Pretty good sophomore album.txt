 Here I am writing a review on the day of it's release. It's been about 4 years since Breaking Point's debut CD, Coming of Age, and what a wait it's been. This CD is definately better than their debut and it shows both in maturity and quality of the songs. Lead vocalist, Brett Erickson, shines in these songs and at times, like in Had Enough Of You, he sounds like the lead singer of Three Days Grace. Their opening track which so happens to also be the first single, Show Me A Sign, they set the tone for the album. The lyrics clearly have passion and meaning behind them. And in case any owners are wondering there's a word or two edited out because for some reason Wind-Up is against all bad words. Sometimes it just ruins the flow but in Breaking Point's case, they don't use those words often at all.  There's no real ballads in this rock CD and for that I'm kind of glad. It's just straight up rock. I don't know where this band is going but I hope they continue to build on what they have. If your a Breaking Point fan this is a must and if not you should at least check them out at their website at www.breakingpointmusic.com  My personal favorites are:  Had Enough Of You, Nothing Left At All, Don't Let Go, and All Messed Up  There's nothing I skip over either, so you're getting 11 songs in the decent to great range.
