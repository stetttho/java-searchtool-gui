 Before you look at the five star rating and figure it's just another gushing fan too excited to rate the album objectively, realize it's hard for an album to get such high regard from me. Ok, so maybe I haven't reviewed much yet and those I have did well but I'm just rating my favorites right now.  Anyhow, this debut CD from Submersed is among my favorite debut releases. There's really something for every rock fan in this CD. The lead singer, Donald Carpenter, powerfully sings these thought provoking lyrics and adds a unique touch now and then to hit the high note. It's comforting to find lyrics that aren't all about doom and gloom or our political system as well. Another plus for the album is the band knows how and when to use guitar solos. Particularly near the end of Flicker and on their following track, Paralellism, the solo sent chills down my spine.   Everything seems to flow from track to track and the reason I give it a 5 star rating is there's not one track I dislike or skip. One of my favorite tracks, Dividing the Hate, is different from the rest. It's probably the hardest track and at one point when Donald is screaming I see a lot of potential from him. If you like most of Wind-Up Records other bands or are a general rock fan you should buy this album as soon as possible.
