 First off you want to get a taste of the book the author has a website http://pages.ca.inter.net/~oblio/home.htm I have very little to add to what you read above.  The book is terrific and makes an excellent case which makes sense of the 1st century and 2nd century Christian literature and debates.  Doherty is the first author I've read who gives an origin of Christianity that does not relly on some sort of bizarre change but rather a gradual evolution.  His treatment of the epistles is without peer.  His treatment of the gospels is a bit weak, and this is clearly an area where this theory needs further development.   If you are someone who finds the Crossen idea of a religiously Jewish Jesus with religiously Jewish disciples turning out Pauline type literature within 20 years of Jesus "death" implausible and would like a reasonable origin for Christianity; this is an excellent book.  By the end of it you'll see how the same movement could contain the epistle of James, Paul's works, Hebrews and proto-gnostic works like Thomas, etc...
