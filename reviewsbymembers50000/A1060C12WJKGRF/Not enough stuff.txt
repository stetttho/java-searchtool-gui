 I also agree I felt really cheated.  There are a ton of topics regarding OSX from a Unix users's perspective I'd like to see covered and this book had about 5% of them.  There is good information in the book its just not indexed well enough and there isn't anywhere near enough book to justify the title.  Its more like a dozen good articles than a book.
