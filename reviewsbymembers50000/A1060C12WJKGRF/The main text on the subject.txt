 If you are reading this review and not by accident you probably should buy this book.  Here are the chapters: 1)  Classic theory of Hilbert Modular Forms 2)  Same theory but using Adelic ideas 3)  How to pass from one theory to the other and the advantages of the adelic viewpoint 4)  Eisenstein series for HMFs 5)  Theta series for HMFs 6)  Arithmetic structure theorem and a special values 7)  Proof of the Arithmetic structure theorem  They material is well down and is designed for self study.  There are unfortunately no exercises which is really the book's only large failing.  Finally if you find this book interesting do a search of Garrett's website.  There is a lot of material there (amazon has a no link rule so I can't link to it).
