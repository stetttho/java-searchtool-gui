 This book is a really good book on how to play short handed.  Most poker books discuss how to play premium hands against large fields of players.  This is a book about how to play sub premium hands in situations where isolation is possible; that is situations where the opponents are tight and unimaginative.    The strategy involved is:  1)	Play cards that will do well against the opponent's likely hands (since the opponents are tight these are limited) 2)	Play in position so you end up heads up 3)	Make sure your little cards are seen by the opponents so that you get an "always plays junk / always bluffs" reputation and thus win big with your big hands that come in due to lose calling.   4)	Play defensively so that you are unlikely to be bluffed at  The book is certainly original enough to warrant picking up for $20.  I wish it were longer and more detailed but the author does also have a tournament practice book.
