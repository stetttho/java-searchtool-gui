 Before starting this book I knew nothing about Jack the Ripper, nor was I ever interested in serial killer books.  This book is genuinely fascinating.  Moore presents a truly interesting hypothesis about the killings as well as provides the reader with a deluge of information to draw their own conclusions.  It's a graphic novel in black and white with a complex storyline.   If you aren't familiar with the format I wouldn't recommend this as a good "first graphic novel". If however you like graphic novels but are worried about the subject matter being tedious, I can attest that Moore manages to make this topic truly fascinating.
