 I agree with everyone that the pictures are gorgeous, and the yoga posses are inspirational.  However I'd like to point out another aspect of how to use this.  Frequently yoga books are written for a beginner to intermediate audience and they show very basic of poses.  You can use this book to look up what an advanced variation looks like.  For example take Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana) which most people learn as a simple back stretch with weight on the legs.  In this book you see the 3rd variation where the head is is laying on the butt and the arms are grabbing the shins.   For me this makes it much clearer what the big difference was between Cobra and Upward facing dog, you can see how the shift in where the weight goes changes what sorts of advanced posses are possible.  Also you get to see asanas I've never seen in any other book, like asymmetrical arm balances (all the weight is on the two arms which are lifting the body while the body is off center and stretching).  Or the existence of Warrior III (Virabadrasana III), everyone knows about I and II but... Anyway, the paperback is a steal in terms of value for your money.  I can't think of any reason not to buy it if you are the sort of person who cares enough to read this review.
