 A really fun game that came out when OSX first came out.  Works well OSX laptops.    Firgured I'd save everyone the trouble I went through to find this.  You can still get this title at a reasonable cost.  Aspyr has put out a 3 CD set called  "leave the lights on" which includes Alice, Undying and Bloodrayne.
