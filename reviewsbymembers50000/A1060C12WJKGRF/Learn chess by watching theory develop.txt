 This is one of the most interesting training books on chess I've read.  This books walks you through a history of chess theory from the mid 1850's to the late 1920's, teaching you the ideas while having you go through a selection of games explaining them.   Almost all of the games are fantastic and the ideas are timeless.  Reti is probably the greatest chess annotator of all time.  This makes for a truly great 2nd book on chess (about the level of "My System") for the desciplined reader.  It can be too easy in the book however to miss subtle points that the games bring out, and since Reti died while writing it the book never reaches the climax.  A strong recommendation for a classic
