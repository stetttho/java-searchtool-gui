 There is a problem in getting going with alg. geo.  To learn the geometry you need commutative algebra and to contextualize commutative algebra you need algebraic geometry.  Mumford is an excellent book to get going without  the need for the heavy prereqs of the more classic books like Hartshore or  G&H.  A really good read.   This is not however a terrific reference  text, you'll need something else as a reference.  Its much to expository  and their is no index.
