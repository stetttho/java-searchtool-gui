 This toy is fantastic.  It deserves to be up there with legos, lincoin logs, tinkery toys, etc... as must have building toys.  Its an incredible toy and if it cost 25% as much I'd say buy it without a second thought.   As for the 86 piece set: 1)  sytrofoam box so the box will get broken by your kids over time.  This won't be a big deal since just about any box will work fine. 2)  Each box is all one color and I didn't know that when looking at the picture on the box.  Turns out this is an advantage since it makes the building less confusing.
