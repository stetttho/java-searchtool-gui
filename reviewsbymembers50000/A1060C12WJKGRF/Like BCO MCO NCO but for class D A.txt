 This book and the first volume (Basic Chess Openings) (...) are an excellent opening book for players between class D and class A.  They cover  the basic ideas of the openings.  In particular they look at all the alternatives that your normal opening book assumes you already know how to refute.    So for example: 1 e4,e5, 2Nf3 Nc6, 3 Bc4.  This is a line that everyone knows (the italian) and everyone knows the "correct response is Bc5.  But why?  Kallia first goes through the very natural Nf6 and how the two knights defense makes life very tough for black.  He then covers the major lines of the two knights a)  Violent central attack (4 d4) b)  Attack on the f7-pawn (4 g5) and their subvariations   Having shown wny 3 Nf6 isn't so good he then looks at 3..Nd4 (and shows how it is refuted by 4Nxd4 while telling white to avoid the trap of 4Nxe5).  Then he looks   3..Be7 and how this ends up too passive.  Thus 3..Bc5 then the 3 main lines are discussed, etc...  Detailed thorough discussion of the basics for people who are capable of understanding opening theory but just don't know it yet.   This book lays the groundwork for you to read an MCO level book.  I strongly recommend it for the player with a USCF rating over 1000 and under 2000.
