 Hugh Ross does a great job at going back to the original words of the Bible, and showing that our english translation may have been the reason why we think that Genesis is a fable. He also goes on to say that the Bible  itself points to creation , and therefore science, as it's "67th  book". For example , the 4th day in Genesis uses the hebrew word  "hayah"(to make visible) which is very different from the hebrew  word "bara"(to create something completely new). This means that  on the fourth day the sun, moon , and stars had already existed from verse  1 (the Big Bang), but that on the surface of the Earth you could not see  the Sun, moon, and stars until God made them visible by changing the  atmosphere from transulcent to transparent. Very curious and remarkable,  since this is what science states happened in earth history.
