 It has been the habit of most ID critics to actually not read the book they discuss when they review books by ID theorists. For example, Mark Perakh describes Ratzch critique of The Design Inference by William Dembski as a "devastating critique, revealing inconsistencies and absence of substantiation in many of Dembski's assertions". This is simply wrong and shows that Mark quite possibly did not understand Ratzch's critique (this is further substantiated by the fact that Mark offers no support for his assertion from the book). The truth is, while he finds Dembski's work valuable, he also points out why he thinks The Design Inference is limited in its application. No more , no less. Overall I think this book is a great contribution to the conversation between ID theorists. And I do recommend reading it.
