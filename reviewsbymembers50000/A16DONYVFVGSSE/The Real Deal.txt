 I'm always skeptical when a popular star puts out a gospel album, but Rise and Shine shares God's grace in a way that is true to scripture and truly enjoyable to the heart, soul, and ear. Randy shares the gospel message with truth and gentleness, but without compromise. Some songs are funny. Others are tender. But they are all glorifying to Christ. Travis co-wrote many of the songs on this albumn, so his personal testimony to his saving relationship with Christ cannot be mistaken. This album can be enjoyed on many levels - as a simple country gospel album, as a worship CD, or as a tool for sharing the gospel message with others.
