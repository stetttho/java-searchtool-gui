 In this book, Phillip Johnson uses evolutionists' own words to show just how unsure of the theory of evolution they really are. And if evolutionists recognize the fatal flaws in their own theory, what of the rest of us? This is a stunning book, not because of its conclusions, but because of who draws them -- the very people who hold to the theory themselves. In their own words, if evolutionists could find another theory besides creation to explain the origin of life and its modification over the years, they'd abandon evolution in a millisecond. What is frightening is that it's only the people at the forefront of evolution who recognize its flaws. The way evolution is presented to the public is as if it's fact, and it's taught as fact, when the people who are in the position to know the most recognize publicly that it's built on sand. Anyone who believes that evolution is a widely accepted view in the scientific community needs to read this book.
