 This is an excellent book that is extremely well documented. From watching the Faith teachers and having friends who accept many of these teachings, I was aware that Faith theology twisted the words of scripture to create a God who is a genie in a bottle, not the sovereign, holy God of the universe. From reading D. R. McConnell's A Different Gospel, I also knew that the origins and tactics of the Faith Movement are occult. What I did not know was that Faith theology descends into overt heresy. Teachers like Copeland, Hagin, Capps, and Hinn deny the Trinity, deny that Jesus is eternal, deny that God is all-powerful and omniscient. They teach that we are made identical with God, equal to Him, and that He cannot operate without our permission. They teach that we are gods. Not all Faith leader teach exactly the same doctrine, but all of it falls into the heretical category. I read this book after first reading the history and occult origins of the Faith movement, A Different Gospel, by D. R. McConnell; and Charismatic Chaos, by John MacArthur - also excellent books.
