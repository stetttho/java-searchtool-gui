 The Message is not a translation of the Bible. It is a paraphrase, and one that clearly reflects the views of the author. Reading through this, I got a creepy, prickly feeling that results when my antennas fly up and scream "danger! danger! danger!" The message of scripture is watered down, colloquialized, and loses its power and meaning. There are some passages that are interesting, and provide unique or different insights into the culture or language of the time, but I strongly feel that this paraphrase should be read ONLY by people who know the scriptures from a direct translation and are mature in their faith. This is NOT a version to be read by people who are new to the scriptures, or to their faith, because it presents a skewed and watered down version of the Bible. One could easily walk away from critical passages about the nature and diety of Christ, or the uniqueness of Christ and His gospel message, and miss the point. This book should NEVER be used as an alternative to the scriptures or be seen as an equally valid translation. That it is being presented as a Bible is very, very frightening. Don't be fooled.
