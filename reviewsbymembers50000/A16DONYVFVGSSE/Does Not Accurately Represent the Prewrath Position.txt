 Although I believe Renald Showers to be a godly man with sincere intentions, this book does not accurately represent the prewrath position. This is unfortunate, since as a friend of Marvin Rosenthal and Robert Van Kampen, Showers was involved in development of the prewrath position from the beginning. Rather than analyzing the foundations and framework of the position, however, Showers "deconstructs" the prewrath position by relying on tangential points that have little or no bearing on the position itself. His proofs also rely heavily, not on the plain meaning of the scriptural text, but on large deductive leaps whose conclusions are stated as fact. Even the title of this book is inaccurate since Showers does not, in fact, analyze the prewrath position. Rather, he analyzes the tangential points of these three books, written about a decade ago, even though the position has been refined and defended considerably since then. As the author of Before God's Wrath: The Bible's Answer to the Timing of the Rapture, a defense of the prewrath view, I am disappointed to see a criticism from a man as well-known and well-respected as Renald Showers so inaccurately represent this view. I give this book two stars only because his discussions about the person, mission, and work of Jesus are tender and insightful.
