 I'm generally not into Real-Time Strategy games, but I really enjoyed this one.  It has a compelling story line, which is unusual in this style of game, and the single-player game has a shallow enough learning curve for even a first-time RTS player, but it doesn't ramp up the complexity so slowly that it's boring.  The three races are fairly well balanced, yet significantly different in their strategies.  I definitely recommend buying the Starcraft: Brood Wars expansion with this, or just buying the Starcraft Battle Chest set that includes both, because Brood Wars adds so much to the Starcraft game.  It continues the story, adds some interesting new units to each side, and re-balances the old units.  With the included editor, you can make your own maps or even whole campaigns.  One of the reasons this game is still popular after so many years is that so many people have done just that, and made their contributions available for download.  More importantly, online-multiplayer support keeps this old game alive by providing an endless supply of new opponents with an endless variety of strategies.  The graphics, of course, are getting progressively more outdated, but in this kind of game, that really isn't a big deal.
