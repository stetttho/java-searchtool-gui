 As Neil Gaiman explains in the introduction, you have to keep in mind, when reading this, that Alfred Bester was looking far forward from a long time ago (as science fiction goes).  Some of his sociological predictions now seem rather unlikely, but there is much of our world today would have seemed unlikely in the 1950's.  On the other hand, many of his technological and (para)psychological predictions are the same ones our contemporary science fiction continues to make.  I had heard of Alfred Bester from time to time for years before I finally got around to reading this book.  Now that I have, I am planning to go out and get more of his books, starting with The Demolished Man.  This tale of obsession and empowerment is compelling and provocative, and Gully Foyle the Everyman Anti-Hero is credible and memorable.  My only complaint is that it was so short.  I might just have to go read it again.
