 This compilation contains: * Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven * Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor * Might and Magic VIII: Day of the Destroyer * Might and Magic IX On a total of eight CDs in a cheap paper folder.  Note that this collection overlaps two games with the previous "Millennium Edition" collection (IV-VII). Also included are: * A map with The Land of Enroth (VI) on one side and Erathia (VII) on the other * A map of The Land of Jadame (VIII) * A map of The Land of Chedian (IX) * Installation instructions on the paper CD folder * No printed manuals This is labelled a "Value Pack" for a reason.  If you want the most games for your money, don't mind reading or printing the manuals from the CDs, and don't like to pay extra for packaging, this collection fits the bill. I can't say anything about the four games themselves, since I haven't actually installed them yet.
