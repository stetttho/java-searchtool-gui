 Starcraft and Brood Wars have very compelling stories for Real-Time Strategy games, so the additional chapters of the single-player story presented in this expansion are worthwhile by themselves.  For multi-player games, the new units and the re-balancing of old units are crucial.  The three sides are now more evenly matched and the new abilities of the new units make everything more interesting.  I can't honestly give this 5/5 for fun because RTS really isn't my thing.  It does get 5/5 overall because as RTS expansions go, it gets everything right.
