 I don't own this (yet) but I found a description of it from the publisher, Interplay, that gives some useful information about this product.  It includes: * Icewind Dale (ASIN: B00004KHB3) * Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter (ASIN: B000058A57) * a "Mini Strategy Guide" for each * bonus CD containing a "Full Strategy Guide" for each * Icewind Dale Soundtrack * Icewind Dale 2 trailer
