 Growing up as a kitten, nobody ever taught Pixel (aka Schroedinger's cat) that walls are solid and he should stop when he runs into them.  Being a feline, and therefore both more capricious and more stubborn than a simple  inanimate object, Pixel ran right on through whatever he wanted to go play  wherever he wanted. Also starring in this story, tying together many  storylines, but not tying them up, are various human members of the Long  family, as well as the sentient computer named "Mike".  Most of  them would probably claim that Richard and Gwen, not Pixel, have the  central roles in this story, but just try to explain THAT to a kitten!   Many of the characters (especially in the latter sections of the book) were  previously introduced in "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress",  "The Rolling Stones", "Time Enough For Love", and  "The Number of The Beast".  As usual for Heinlein, it is  recommended that you read those books first, or this story is likely to  make as much sense to you as it does to Pixel.
