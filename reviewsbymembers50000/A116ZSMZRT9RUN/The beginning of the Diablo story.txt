 Heavily emphasizing action at the expense of story depth, the original Diablo set the standard for Action Role-Playing games for years to come and countless clones followed in its wake.  Some of those clones, and especially the sequel, Diablo II, subsequently made great advances in this style of gaming, not to mention the usual advances in graphics.  Games don't age well, especially genre-defining games, so the original Diablo is now unfortunately obsolete.  If you want a good Action Role-Playing game, try Diablo II (with the Lord of Destruction expansion), or Beyond Divinity, or perhaps Sacred.  There are plenty to choose from with newer graphics, more role-playing complexity, and/or more new, cool features.  If you're the kind of purist who wants to play the whole Diablo story from the beginning, it's cheaper to buy the Diablo Battle Chest, which includes this, along with the sequel, the sequel's expansion, and a hint book.  The only reasons I can think of to buy this are  1) to complete a collection,  2) to play the story from the beginning (not that there's much story anyway) when you already have Diablo II, or  3) you want a cheap, simple Action RPG with very little character complexity and just a hint of storyline, and you don't mind outdated graphics.
