 This was not the best mystery/adventure game I've ever played, and I'm not even a big fan of such games to begin with, but I am a serious X-Phile.  Despite the seven CDs full of Full Motion Video than make up the game, it wasn't a whole lot like being in an X-Files episode.  Instead, it was more like being one of those "other agents" who make brief appearances two or three times per season.  You actually have to do some of the tedious legwork to collect evidence instead of having it conveniently handed to you after the commercial break.  Of course, the up side to that is a more immersive, believable feel to the game and a feeling of accomplishment when you finally do spot the crucial clue. Fans of the series will find plenty of references to themes, conspiracies, events, and trivia from various episodes, as well as the familiar faces.  While it's not strictly necessary to recognize all the references to the series in order to solve the mystery, it does add quite a bit to the game. If you're not a fan of The X-Files, there are better mystery/adventure games out there.  If you find mystery/adventure games frustrating, you probably won't like this one even if you are a fan.  On the other hand, if you do enjoy both this type of game and the series it's based on, you'll have a lot of fun with this game.
