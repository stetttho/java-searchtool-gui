 Just a few things that struck me about peoples opinions on this album and even moreso on the minimalist rock craze... A lot of people sure do bellyache about the lack of musical talent Jack and Meg have but seldom do they discuss the actual songwriting itself. Sure it may be easy to play Seven Nation Army on guitar but could you write it? If as many people could invent Stripes songs as could play them, then why arent there more people making millions and gaining international recognition rather than writing customer reviews?  Others claim a 2D sound, which I agree with if what they mean (and seem to suggest) is that there is an obvious lack of everything except a guitar and a drumset. However, one thing that has always amazed me about the stripes is that their sound is larger than their ensemble would suggest based on appearance. On some songs, Jack out-rocks (if that's even a word) entire, so-called rock bands. Usually, I am not a huge fan of these new minimalist groups but the stripes are an exception. They are unique, not in how they play their intruments or how many are in their band but, most of all, it's how they use them.
