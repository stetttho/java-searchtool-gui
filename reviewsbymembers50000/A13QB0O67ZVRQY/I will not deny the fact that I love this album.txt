 This is the first Lips album I have purchased and I enjoyed it thouroughly on my first listen. The simplistic yet soothing melodies, as well as Mr. Coyne's upbeat, honest lyrical style, has captivated my senses. The first 6 tracks (minus Yoshimi Pt.2) are breathtaking and those that follow are far from mediocrity.    If youre into sheer visceral enjoyment of what you are listening to then this is the album for you. If youre into turning everything into an intellectual gamut of genres and comparative analyses then perhaps you should not be listening to music at all...go make spreadsheets or something.    Now, I absolutely have to see about "Soft Bulletin".
