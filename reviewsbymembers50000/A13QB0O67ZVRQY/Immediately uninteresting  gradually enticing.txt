 Initially what I heard on this record were simplistic vocals, a string of non sequiturs, layered onto the slowed droning of a DnB loop with staccato snares eminating from each track with the regularity of senior citizens after their morning prunes.   While I would never reconcile with several tracks on this album, ones that I still find monotonous to listen to, more than half of the songs on this record are some of the most unassumingly beautiful tracks I have ever come across. The addition of female vocals on several songs, particularly "Nothing Better", was genius.   Four stars because while the album still does reach a boring lull in the middle (ie/Clark Gable, Recylced Air), the first four and final three tracks are all remarkable in their own right.
