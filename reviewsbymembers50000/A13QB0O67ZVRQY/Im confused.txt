 I have heard far too many people compare this band to Nirvana. I personally cannot believe Nirvana fans would stoop so low as to compare this band to (possibly) their own personal favourite artists. Silverchair is like Nirvana...probably in content alone...at times...other than that...NADA! There is this other little known band, you might have heard of them, called Stone Temple Pilots which Silverchair sounds a lot like in my mind. Think about it (the vocals especially) and I think you will agree. The depressing metal-ish songs are also somewhat reminicent of another little known (sarcasm) grunge band known as Alice in Chains. To put it bluntly, it seems like some Nirvana fans thought Silver sounded remotely like Nirvana and jumped on them for "biting" their style. My opinion is that Silverchair was comprised of young kids who loved the grunge sound and, as many artists have had occasion to do so in the past, emulated bands they may have been influenced by. Most bands dont develop their own sound for at least a few albums. Take the vines for instance (please!), they sound like everything from the Beatles to (ironically...or maybe not) Nirvana. Yet I have faith in the Vines, as I did with Silverchair, that they would develop their own sound and ween themselves from the days of playing air guitar to their favourite group. To assume a band could (especially at such a young age)completely sever themselves from their influences is a ridiculous expectation and rarely ever happens.  Yep...thats basically what I was thinking...
