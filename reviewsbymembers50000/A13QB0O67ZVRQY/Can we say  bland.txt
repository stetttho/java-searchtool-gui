 Apparently not if you like Jedi Mind. I read another reviewer mention that there are no sub-par songs and chuckled to myself. He/she is right, there are not bad songs and its pretty much all mediocre...but allow me to elucidate... Another reviewer smartly titled his review "I liked it better when it was called Wu-tang". Nothing could be more correct. If you took all sorts of early 90's Wu and found the mean sound between all of their songs and produced it over and over...you would get Jedi Mind. It seems most likely that the production was probably stolen from the dumpster outside of RZA's house. Im sure Mr. Diggs doesnt mind just as most people dont mind when hobos look through their GARBAGE. The lyrics arent all that intelligent either. I think this is simply a case of people new to the underground thinking a lyricist who name drops shakespeare is a genius because it is so unfathomable for an emcee to do so. I thought most people read Shakespeare when they are in high school...I guess its good if you dropped out in grade 9 and dont own a library card. Wordsworth they are not! If it didnt make a...poor attempt at copying Wu I would have given them one star.
