 I was trying to think of something equivocal to the difference between "blue lines"/"protection" and "100th Window". Somebody may kick me in the head for this one but I thought the mellowness and total absence of Tricky warranted the comparison with the difference between Beck's "Midnight Vultures" and "Sea Change". Just as I thought...its a superficial comparison. The point is that this is not the trip-hop that Massive used to be but was stepping away from in Mezzanine. It's all still very noir but the feel is definitely something a lot mellower and a little slower at times. I personally like this album a lot and also being a sigur ros fan I was pleasantly surprised...furthermore the bassy deep sound envelops you as it always did if not more so. Definitely a compliment to good stereo systems everywhere. So why 4 stars? I just dont like it's diversion from trip-hop is all. Massive virtually gave birth to the genre and now it has dofted it like a kitten who has worn out it's welcome by shredding a chairleg. But if you were never crazy about tricky but always liked Massive Attack...then this is definitely for you.
