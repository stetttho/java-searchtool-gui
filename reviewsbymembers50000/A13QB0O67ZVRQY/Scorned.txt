 I will not reiterate what has already be said. With that in mind I have but one comment about this album. I came to like blur very late and first bought the "best of..." disc. I dont know if it's just me but the best singles from "Modern Life..." are not present on blur's "best of...". This is a great CD and it's a shame that new fans just getting into blur cannot find anything good from this album on the supposed "best of..." disc.
