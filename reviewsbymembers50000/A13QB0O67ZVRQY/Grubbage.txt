 I have heard spoken word hip-hop before. Masta Killah of the Wu Tang Clan had a silky, almost evangelical touch to his non-rhymes. This album, however, sounds like a CD full of the guy from the title track of blur's 1994 release "Parklife" - its good for an intro track but not for a full album.     Probably the only thing that saves this album from getting one-star by me is the fact that the beats are not awful and somewhat mask the monotonous droning on of Mr. Michael Skinner.     Get this album if you want to hear an ordinary British guy talking over half-decent hip hop beats about life. Personally I'd rather hear my Grandpa tell WW2 stories.
