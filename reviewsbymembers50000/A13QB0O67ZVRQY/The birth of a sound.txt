 Massive's characteristic low haunting bass lines overlayed with heartfelt yet sleepy lyrics gave birth to an entire genre. This album is undoubtedly the influence behind many similar bands that would come later and fall under the genre of "trip hop".  ie/portishead, morcheeba, tricky (obviously!), sneaker pimps, etc.  This album is the womb of trip hop and is a joy to listen to, minus one or two dull moments. If you like any of the bands listed above you should probably consider buying this CD.
