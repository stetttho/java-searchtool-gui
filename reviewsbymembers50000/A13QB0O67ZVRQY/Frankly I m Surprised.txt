 This album didnt even crack Amazon's top Underground albums (to call the Roots underground is a flat out lie).   In any event, this album is not something to be missed. With quirky yet brutally honest lyrics and remarkable beat archetecture, this is a must own for anyone who can appreciate hip hop music.
