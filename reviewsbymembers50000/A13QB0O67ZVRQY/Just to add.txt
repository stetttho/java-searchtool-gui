 I have been reading through and most other reviewers have expressed my sentiments adequately. I have but one axe to grind with Zwan and that it their subliminal Christian-rock undertones. I try to ignore it when listening to the CD but once a non-Christian realizes the truth you can never listen to "Honestly" ever again. Music is absolutely beautiful...like a refined Gish or Siamese Dream but the lyrics...I suppose I am just neurotic...yea...thats it.
