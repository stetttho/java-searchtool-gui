 I remember always thinking that RJ was absolutely sick and how his production combined with a decent lyricist would make a fantastic album. Once the album was set to be released I thought that under the Rhymesayers label they could hardly go wrong. I was only half right. RJ proves he can hold up his end of the bargain on production but Blueprint fails to do the same. RJ's work commands powerful thought-provoking lyrics which Blueprint just could not deliver. His voice is simply not alluring enough to make anybody stand up and take notice and I often find myself missing the point of what Blueprint is trying to say because I get to bored with the mundanity of his voice. On closer inspection the lyrics are nothing that impressive either. The most powerful parts of 8 million stories are the mournful samples thrown in by RJ himself that can be seen in all his prior work (ex/ No excuse). In reality I am looking forward to another solo project by RJ than another Soul Position album.  3 Stars for RJ...none for BP...
