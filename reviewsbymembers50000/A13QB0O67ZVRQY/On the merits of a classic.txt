 To be deserving of 5-stars, in my mind, an album must be listenable all the way through without any desire to forward through it whatsoever. To earn the status of "classic" (also by my own definition) one must be able to listen through the album over a period of several years without tiring of it.  Both of the above are applicable to Siamese Dream. I first heard it almost 10 years ago and have owed the CD for 8 years - still I am not bored of it in the least. This is one of the greatest discs ever pressed and few people with ears can deny this truth.
