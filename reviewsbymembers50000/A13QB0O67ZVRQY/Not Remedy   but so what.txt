 Most of the people on here who gave this album a rating of 3 stars and below seem to base their arguments on personal preference and not whether this album is good or not. I will admit that I enjoyed Rooty and Remedy probably more so than this album but that does not make Kish Kash trash. Here are a few random thoughts on the album:  -Dancibility is definitely lessened from the perspective of a house junkie but anyone familiar with funk, hip-hop, and soul would certainly not agree.  -Unlike certain others I would disagree that this is the wrong direction for Basement Jaxx; it is a different direction and to call it wrong is being biased and narrow-minded.   -The "over-layering" of the tracks can be distracting...to a chimpanzee. Seriously, the basis on which all these tracks are founded are no different than any other Jaxx album its only the loops overtop that give the album a distinctly new sound. This seems to be a concept many kids can't get their heads around.  It seems to me that a lot of people just want the same thing as they were making earlier. They want to hear "Flylife", "Rendez-vous" or "Romeo" all over again. I am personally grateful that they dared to do something unlike their prior works. Sure I like Remedy and even Rooty one star more but I already own them and do not need another copy.
