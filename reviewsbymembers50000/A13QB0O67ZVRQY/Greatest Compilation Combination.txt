 "Well who are you? Im the one that they call A-B. And do what? Step to me you'll be O-U-T." Before I got that I had only heard of Prev from Swollen and Moka as featured on the first Battle Axe compilation. I showed a friend of mine my 2 Battle Axe CDs and he set me up with this beauty and Bad Dreams (before they added "Bring it Home" and ruined it by reproducing the "Fuel Injected model" of song production). I popped Bad Dreams in right away and put off this one until I was bored and popped it in my discman. "Well who are you? Im the one P-R-E-V. And do what? Step to me youll lose your J-O-B." I was blown away by the tracks at the beginning and the end of the albums. The middle lags a bit but I can see the attempt at CRAPPY experimentation. At any rate, it is all forgiven by the end of the disc. The 3 minds at work on this disc flow and intertwine so well that on my favourite song that I have been quoting all along ("Antz out of a Job") has all three of them on every chorus basically completing a single idea as one mind.  "Well who are you? Im the one M-O-K-E. And do what? Step I'll crush you like an A-N-T." A must buy for anyone loves 2 or more of these artists individually.
