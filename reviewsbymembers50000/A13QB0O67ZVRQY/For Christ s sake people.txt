 Everyone has their own "greatest hits" on any given artist that they like. I just dont see why some longtime fans bother reviewing an item that it not necessarily designed for them. These albums are often created with those who havent yet bought a single RHCP album in mind. They put all their catchiest and most popular songs so that soon enough even those who were apprehansive before about buying a RHCP album will now buy one. In other words, dont give this album a bad rating just because you own every album and the tracklist doesnt meet your expectations. This album is not for you...now go listen to uplift or something...
