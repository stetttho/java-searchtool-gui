 I am probably in danger of ridicule as a hip-hop head to the bone...but Neptunes surprised the hell out of me. They had mostly been mainstream pop junk but this time it's personal. The tunes are no longer selling themselves out to the industry...wait...they are...I just remembered the "Pass the Crovosier" video...P>Anyways, to rephrase, in this album it seems the tunes have kept their best stuff to themselves and the lyrics arent stupid either. No comparison to an Atmosphere, El-P or Gift of Gab...but still..."Provider" is up there on my top singles list. 3 and a half stars...not bad for hip-pop!
