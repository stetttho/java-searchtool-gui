 It has been said time and again that Jet unequivocally rips off the sound of many other different bands, perhaps in an attempt to revitalize that "retro" rock sound. If that wasnt bad enough they arent even the first band to do that! Ever heard of Sloan? They've been doing for years what it seems Jet attempted for the first time in 2003.   Sure, Jet may be pleasing to the ears but, in the end youre just fooling yourself and giving money to a bunch of wannabes by buying this album. Nothing about this group hasnt been done before and they are merely trying to capitalize on a retro craze. Do yourself a favour and buy the classics themselves rather than this rehash.
