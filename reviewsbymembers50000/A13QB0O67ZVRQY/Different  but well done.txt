 When I first read the title of RJ's latest album I was reminded of the Avalanches debut "Since I Left You". I had no idea that the music itself would be so similar.  There should be no duplicity in the fact that "Since We Last Spoke" is far from the sort of hip hop most have come to expect from RJD2 and Def Jux. That being said, I still cannot say this is a bad album. It is fantastic record to simply put on your headphones and get lost in, like a Massive Attack record for example. Far from being "elevator music", it is a liquid soundscape that proves hip-hop DJs can provide more than loop a simple "boom-bap" of a beat.  I would be a fool to say that RJ is the first to try and demonstrate the potential of a hip-hop DJ, however, RJ has succeeded in this endeavour where others (like Prefuse 73) have failed. Dead Ringer was better (slightly) but definitely a four-star effort.
