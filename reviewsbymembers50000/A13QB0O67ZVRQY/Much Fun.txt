 I will admit I have not listened to the first Simian album but if it's not like this one I may not care for it. I enjoy the punchy effervescence this album brings to the table. Its playfulness reminds me of a more rock-oriented Basement Jaxx, I enjoy it and I dont care what anyone says to the contrary.
