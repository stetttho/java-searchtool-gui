 This film was a fantastic expose on the sort of domestic problems within the United States placed on a level that the average person can understand. Michael Moore, surprisingly, does not merely address gun control. For example, he touches on the endemic problem in America concerning the African American underclass and what is and is not being done to remedy the situation.  However, he spoils his work by inappropriately, (sometimes inaccurately ie/Bosnia) discussing international affairs. Moore seems to believe that bad moves by the U.S. government corrolate with the domestic issue of gun control. He wags his finger at overseas military action, that is not always unwarranted, as if it is the reason that the Columbine shootings occured. Simply because the U.S. military has guns and has the tendency to act aggressively overseas does not mean that is why an American civilian will buy a gun and start schooling (Lee Harvey Oswald being an obvious exception). The Canadian military has firearms too and has been involved in nearly every conflict the United States has been involved in for the last century excluding the Vietnam war and the recent war on Iraq. This was a poor attempt by Moore to put his views on American foreign policy in this film that should have rightly stayed on U.S. soil.  "Bowling for Columbine" gets minus one star for the shameless plug of international views and minus one point for inaccuracies and misleading statements on that point.
