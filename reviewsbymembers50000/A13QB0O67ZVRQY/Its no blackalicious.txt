 As one reviewer suggested earlier, this album lacks chemistry between the DJ and emcee. As a result the beats are pretty staid, albeit not bad, while Gift of Gab does his thing. The only time where the beat archetecture is really apparent is on "hold on" which is SO dope but only lasts 46 seconds. Five stars for Gab three stars for the DJs, which averages out to four stars. Key tracks are 1,10, and 14.
