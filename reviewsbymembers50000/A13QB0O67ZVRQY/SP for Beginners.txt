 I'll admit it, I got into the band Blur only after their greatest hits album came out and it was through that album that I was vaulted into the world of Damon Albarn and his crew. This album should be no different. Much like the Blur "Best of.." CD this one contains all their "greatest hits" that were pretty much all turned into videos and are the singles that most people know and can get their minds around most easily. Any longterm fan who owns their previous discs should be well aware that this is not necessarily a compilation of their best music but instead seems like more of an attempt to draw in those who always liked the SP but were too apprehensive to go out and invest in a full CD. It also serves to lure in the less die-hard fans (but fans no less) with their best soundtrack work and one or two unreleased, yet still accessible, tracks. In summation, this should be nothing new to anyone who has followed the pumpkins throughout their career and dare I say that many (myself included) have probably burned songs like Eye, Drown, Untitled, and the entire Machina II set due to their relative inaccessibility. For those people I would suggest waiting for more action from Zwan or figuring out what this whole "Glass and the Machines of G-d" business will be. For those who have no listened to much SP outside of Radio and MTV play this album contains a lot of great songs and I would recommend it highly if you want to get into the pumpkins and maybe purchase some of their other albums later on.
