 I loved the Shins first album. Their psych-rock sound was something  fresh that had not been done for awhile (at least not that I had heard) and they did it well. However, there were a few times when I found that the songs were a little too consistant and seldom varied, with a few notable exceptions. Ultimately, it was a great album if a little staid.  In "Chutes too Narrow" I got more of a sense that they were breaking out. They Moved away slightly from what made them so popular, a necessary step with any new album, with a twangier sound and, more importanly, the Shins varied their sound more than they had on "Oh, Inverted World". The album is, as it has been said before, more eclectic and less defined, which is precisely what they needed to do. In other words, the problems I found in the first album were overcome. Considering how many artists fail to improve upon their mistakes on their sophmore album this, in itself, is worthy of commendation.   I was more than satisfied with this release, even if others were not, and I do not hesitate to give it 4.5 stars (although I am rating it a full five). A good album from start to finish. There are occasional lapses but they are altogether forgiveable.
