 Unlike most other techniques books, the techniques shown here are very practical and easily tried out, with the f-stops, FL and shutter on every photo (unlike many other books). Most of the techniques you will ever need are included, and more. Well served as a field guide too, it's fairly small to tuck into the camera bag. Excellent writeups and light-hearted reading, so good it's one of my most often read books. Not much of a coffee table since the images are fairly small. Another excellent book from Lee is Night and Low Light Photography, a seldom touched area of photography.
