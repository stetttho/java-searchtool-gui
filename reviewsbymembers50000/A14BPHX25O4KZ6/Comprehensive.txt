 Although some may find the info redundant, some like me, being lazy would want this book as a kind of reference to common/useful methods. It also describes alternatives to many photoshop plug-ins, such as using Eye Candy  Bevel to Photoshop Bevel, which is useful. No other book I know describes  plug-ins this way in such detail. Good Buy. If only it comes in full color,  my favourite is Photoshop 5 Artistry...must have!~
