 Having read Cornelius Ryan's The Longest Day, I had a feeling that surely someone must have written stories on a more personal scale and this book came in, perhaps I'm ignorant or what but I had never came across another single book that depicts that fateful day on such a personal basis. Bitter stories revealed that the invasion might have failed if not for the valor and valient efforts from isolated, singular units fighting their own war to make the invasion a success. Screw-ups were not hidden. The Germans at the invasion beaches provided firsthand accounts and experiences which were uncommon in other books. Well laid-out, the preparations by the Allies and Germans (in lesser detail) were well described and preliminary actions (mainly the airborne forces) adding to the details. Chapters were dedicated to most 1st wave regiments/battalions, some were left out but war stories can never be complete. German small unit actions were described in much lesser details, and the breakdown of higher commands were only mentioned briefly, which I attribute as a major component to the invasion success. A separate volume, Citizen Soldiers, on surface seems to talk only about the Americans but is acually an excellent followup to this book, read the reviews in detail.
