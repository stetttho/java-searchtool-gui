 Angel Lee had already said most of the great features about this book so I will just add on it. Breathtaking shots on America's national parks, I bought it along with Spectacular China, and Spectacular Ireland, books from the same series. A very general book on the national parks of America, and so do not expect many shots on each area. My favourite would be the canyon shots, but there are too few, and none too surprised. A companion book would be Spectacular Alaska, which I find a real essential to get hold of. It's been said and I'm going to say it again, the real treat is the fold-out panoramas (about 3 x A3 paper length). With the wide-angle view, one can almost imagine standing right in front of the parks, not to mention the other full page shots. At this price, it's a fairly good deal, with all the panaromas you can hardly find elsewhere, you would just need to get dedicated books on individual national parks, especially those of Colorado and Grand Canyon, among the best nature can offer I would say. Ths is the best one among the Spectacular series, China is another great book, with panaroma shots of the Great Wall, as well as her scenic valleys and mountains. The whole series is Highly recommended for coffee table (though the shots in Spectacular Ireland seems so murky and out of focus) and to inspire you to get off the couch and see them for yourself....
