 An unique effort to do something like this. Many of the photos are not that great after all but the point is: they were taken at the dawn of a new age. I just wish the publisher had increased the no. of entries twofold to really emphasize the significance. 5 stars for the tremendous effort but the deduct is for that fact that it's not really worldwide. After browsing it I thought it's for North America flora and fauna (flip a few pages here and there and you still see USA and Canada), with a bit from other continents till I bought it and realise it's meant to cover most regions of the world. Where's the greater part of Asia? and the Poles? South America? They could have invite those not in the team to submit photos that they lack, better luck next time but it will be another thousand years. Excellent coffee table but once the reader grasp the idea behind it will also wonder like me.....where's the rest of the world?
