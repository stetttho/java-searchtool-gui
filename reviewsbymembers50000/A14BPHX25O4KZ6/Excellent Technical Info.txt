 I had done a fair bit of macro and I always thought I had good knowledge of the subject till I read this book. A lot of technical data and tables to help a newbie (and those who never bothered to see the technical side of macro, like me)to get up and running.  One very uncommon (but excellent) area he dipped in is to teach the readers some basic techniques to build flash brackets, simple diffuser, reflector etc that actually works, not step-by-step but at least it gives the reader some idea. If you want a more light-hearted reading or leave it on the coffee table, then get Complete Guide to Close-Up & MacRo Photography by Paul Harcourt Davies. This book is more focused on fauna, hard cover, real beauty to look at and is also excellent in its own right.
