 If you really really can only buy one book, get this. Somehow it cost only US$30 here in Singapore. There's no better book on general photography than this for any amount of money. The book generalised photography and yet does not skimp on any topics, there's just enough for one to know about any form of photography and that's the good thing about it. It links all aspects of photography together and makes one appreciates other forms of photography not previously explored. It helps to get specialised books to further enhance specific topics, like John Shaw's Profrssional Field Techniques, Landscape Photography; Jim Zuckerman Natural Light Photography;  Another excellent book on general photo techniques is Lee Frost's A-Z of Creative Photography. There are many other great photography books that I keep, for reference and leisure reading.
