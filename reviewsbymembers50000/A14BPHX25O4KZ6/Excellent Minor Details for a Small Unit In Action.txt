 I must admit this, I was sceptical about the value of this book as it was quite costly compared to Mr Ambrose's other books. And so I read it up at the local bookstore, and viola I nearly finished the book that afternoon. However the gripping stories and tales of a tiny little unit so closely illustrates many other units' life that I bought it and spend the next few days reading it again. The stories are fairly personal and each soldier had his different view towards the war, but like the namesake everyone (nearly) fights for his buddy, the country and the world. In fact, I'm reading it right now......if only more tales are in
