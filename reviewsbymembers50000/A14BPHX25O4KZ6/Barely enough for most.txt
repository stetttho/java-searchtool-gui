 Apologies first, the cover was not that inspiring compared to many other photography books, and so had yet to buy it. I picked it up at a local library and went through it, basically it focus on cityscapes shooting, a very interesting area to learn due to the difficulty in getting the desired exposure and lighting. I realize that there are many repeating information on bulbs/lights temperature and type, sure they are the main essence to coloring the shots but having such information all over the place makes the book seems so messy. The best thing about this book is the illustration of shots taken on diferent lighting and film. It really does help you to see more creatively if you are new to this. Interestingly it does shed some light on light painting, seldom found in writing, actually I had no real idea on how it really works till I read this book. I had done some light painting prior to this, but only for fun, this book tells you how to expose it. Whether it appeals to you, you just have to see it for yourself. This is not a wholly technical book, more inclined towards beginner on night shooting. Newbies may like the presentation of the book, very journal-like (and hence seems disorganized), like writing a trip on night photography, but there's no section on fundamental photography (and I dont suggest one to start learning photography through this area...might just put one off with the difficult shooting situations). Newbies to night shooting may like the information on color temp and the type of lights associated, and how they actually look like. Advanced people may find the book too shallow, and fundamental.
