 Very inspirational book, not really helpful if you are dipping into landscape for the first time, instead it pulls you in once you get some idea of landscape photography. Beautiful photos, certain amount of technical and yet great as a coffee table book. IMHO less diverse than John's other book; Professional Field Techniques (PFT) but I prefer it this way. In fact this was the single book that drawn 2 of my friends into serious photography just by browsing..... Much of the techniques are duplicated in the PFT book (I have yet to see the latest edition though) but based on the older one I would say to give this PFT book a miss, the printing is not as glossy (I'm one of those who prefer photography book in gloss) and not much more info is actually conveyed. Of course if you want to collect a few books only, skip Landscape and get PFT instead.
