 This is a very technical book, those dipping into photography as a beginner will really yawn fast. In short not for learning but as a technical reference. Excellent information on everything I can think of, data tables, charts, dials, formulas. In fact got me learning new stuff on light metering and exposure. An initial problem is that the filters are referred in Kodak terms and Wratten, eg 20B, 30R, 20C etc...kinda confusing at times, I still don't quite it much of the time (too lazy perhaps) but minor glitch. One other thing is, read it before you go for the trip! Can really get messy if you need info in a hurry. Really thoughtful that a gray card is included but I prefer the neat idea that the Nat. Geographic Field Guide team did; inside covers acting as gray cards! cool. Saying it as a field guide would be a bit of overstatement, at least for my purpose. The cover is so thin and binding so flimsy that I wonder what the publisher and author are thinking. I had to reinforce it with tapes and thick cardboard, maybe some wont need it but people like me who carry the camera in a watertight bag in one hand and go backpacking might just need to do these. I wish it's smaller (thicker is not a problem) but alas, one can never please everybody... Get this book, even if you think you won't need it (like me), you might just learn new tricks never thought of or come across your mind.
