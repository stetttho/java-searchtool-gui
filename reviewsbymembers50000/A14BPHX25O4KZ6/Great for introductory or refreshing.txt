 There are many techniques and understanding I never knew till I read this book. I had read many books including Photography by Barbara London and Ansel Adams's books. They are great books in their own right but this book brings out many knowledge not revealed in other books. The photos are arranged that they show different settings and excellent descriptions to accompany. Not for the coffee table though, rather technical for that. Great for introductory reading and refreshing guide for people like me.....forgetful. One of my must-have technical guides.
