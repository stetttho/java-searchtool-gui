 Though the book claims to teach you how to make use of the natural light, in reality you can hardly duplicate the efforts Jim had made, they were simply composed perfectly, flawlessly. And the equipment too...I will not buy the equipment he used and will not have the time to wait for the perfect shot like him. As for the cover shot, he claimed that it was a snapshot. And this is simply the best safari photo I had ever seen! Period. I gave 5 stars not for the techniques you can learn to use but for the flawless and simply stunning shots. However you can appreciate how the same scene will look like under different lighting conditions. And the book is organised into shots taken during different times of the day.
