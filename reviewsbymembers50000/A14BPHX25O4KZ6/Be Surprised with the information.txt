 I never wanted to get it, someone gave it to me and while the manual was with someone else I had to read up this book to find some information and along the way browse it.  Surprise surprise! there's information on how the auto pic modes actually work (technically) and how the creative zones modes differ. I have no way to test out the theories behind these modes but if it can be published it must be accurate and correct.  Another nice addition is info on all current EF lenses and some flash info on 550EX, you can easily find them on the internet but bedside readers like me would very much prefer to read on real paper stock. If you think you need it, get it. You won't lose anything for not getting it but any additional info will certainly made you look at the amazing Canon technologies from another point of view. Surprisingly the Nikon guides are more comprehensive and hence, more value for money.
