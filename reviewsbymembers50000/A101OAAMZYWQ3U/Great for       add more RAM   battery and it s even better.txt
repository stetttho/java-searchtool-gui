 I agree with the previous reviewers that this laptop a great entry level.  The screen is GREAT, integrated wireless works well, and a 60GB hard drive are nice.  The two major weaknesses of this product are the tiny amount of RAM (if you try running more than one application at once the thing is unuseable) and the short battery life. I also agree with previous reviewers that if you add another stick of RAM to this, it rips along quite well. I purchased this as an entry level machine and use it for web-access, MS Office, watching DVDs on the go, uploading and sorting through digital photos while away from home.   The Celeron processor really struggles if I try any heavy photo editing but I generally try save that stuff for my desktop machine.
