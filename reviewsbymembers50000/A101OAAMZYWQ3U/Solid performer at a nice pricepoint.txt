 While I wouldn't consider the E-300 a direct competitor to the EOS20 (much more expensive)its performance is a little behind the REBELXT in some aspects (burst capacity & images@ISO800+) IT IS ALSO HUNDRED$ LESS.  For most uses, this camera provides essentially the same performance as its pricier competitors! I recently upgraded to the E-300 from the C-8080WZ (an incredible/versatile workhorse)and have been quite impressed with the nicer features present in the E-300. Major noticeable differences between the C-8080 and E-300: Zoom control(mechanical ring)!!, Shutter Release speed, speedier autofocus,  CF write speed!!!, speed in working with RAW files, 10+ excellent preset scene shooting modes (Sunset, Night, Fireworks, Beach/snow,...) to help even a beginner produce great looking images.  In short, this is a great camera for the money (~$800) but if you are really picky or you want lots of high ISO shots you'd be happier spending $200 more for a bit nicer camera.
