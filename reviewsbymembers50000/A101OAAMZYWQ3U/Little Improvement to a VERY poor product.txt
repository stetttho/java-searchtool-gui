 Yet another buggy and less-than-average program by Roxio. This version fixes a few of the many flaws in the last version but nowhere near enough to justify using this product over MS Digital Image, Adobe Photoshop Elements, JASC PaintShop, etc.  I wish that I had never purchased this product.  DO NOT use the one-touch photo doctor!  It oversharpens your photos and they come out looking very poor!
