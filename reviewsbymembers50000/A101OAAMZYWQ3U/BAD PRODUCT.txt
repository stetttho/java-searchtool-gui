 This is the last PRINT ARTIST brand software that I'll ever buy.  This software is VERY buggy.  I have to reboot my computer every time that I want to print something (tried this program on Win98, WinME, Win2000 & WinXP Pro) While there are some nice intentions, this software is horrible.  Not only does the printing not work, the program freezes frequently and the on-screen view is frequently corrupted- you can't tell what is going to print until you print it!
