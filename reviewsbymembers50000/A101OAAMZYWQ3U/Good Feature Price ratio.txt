 I have owned this PDA for about 6 months now. The battery life is far superior to the iPAQ3XXX series PDAs! I can use this off and on for a few days straight without having to recharge. Aside from battery life, it seems to be very fast and responsive compared to my Toshiba Genio. Another major selling point was the Dual memory slots-Compact Flash and Secure Digital. Aside from the features mentioned above, I also am impressed with the form factor.  Although it is not quite as slim as the 4XXX series iPAQs it is still among the smallest and sleekest PDAs that I have seen.  Complaints: This does not run PPC 2003 2nd edition : ( PIM info disappears if batteries go dead.  iPAQ FileStore utility does not prevent this... I had a CASIO that kept all PIM info and settings even after a week with a dead battery (vacation).  Overall This is by far my favorite PDA yet!
