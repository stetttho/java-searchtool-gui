 All of these Kodak Easyshare cameras seem to have the same problem with horrible image processing.  Colors look good but the compression is atrocious.  If I use the "2-megapixel" image as my computer wallpaper (~1megapixel) there is a great deal of JPEG artifacting evident.  These images are OKAY to print as 3.5" x 5" prints but not much larger.  Even 4"x6" prints start to show artifacting and noise.  As if it isn't bad enough to have poor images, the camera also eats 2 AA batteries for every 35 images captured!!! I have to bring a pack with extra batteries everywhere I take my camera!
