 Out of the few dozen burners that I've used, I have to say that this is THE BEST that I've ever used.  The drive is very fast and the included software is AWESOME! Add to that Plextors awesome support and you just can't find any better CD-RW!  The only thing better is Plextor's new DVD burner that does it ALL. I installed this in my bosses home computer so he could archive hundreds of CDs faster. He not only loved the drive but the SimpliCD software is his favorite part. SOOO easy! Now I guess that I could mention that the guys at plextor are fanatics and leave no detail unattended to- even the color of the tray helps minimize the chance of errors while reading!
