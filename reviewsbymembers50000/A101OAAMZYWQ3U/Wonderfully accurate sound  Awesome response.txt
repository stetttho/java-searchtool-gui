 I Purchased these as rear speakers to complete surround sound set. I had no idea that they would sound sooo nice! They have a wonderful range of response and the resolution is great!  After plugging them in, I ended up routing all power just to them and listening to a full symphony from my rear speakers! Solid as tanks and outstanding performers!
