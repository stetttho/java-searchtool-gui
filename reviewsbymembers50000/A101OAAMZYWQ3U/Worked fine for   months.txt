 This DVD player worked just fine for around 9 months and now something has gone wrong with the processor- I no longer get any output to the subwoofer channel from either the Digital Coax or the analogue multichannel outputs.  I am also starting to notice that the surround channels cut out frequently.  Too bad that the warranty only lasted for 3 months...
