 This drive reads/rips cds very quickly, reads even scratched DVDs very well and exhibits very reliable recording.   The packaged software is very useful! I already owned NERO6 Ultra and a video capture card but have had problems with when attempting to capture video with either dropped frames (NERO6 & InterVideo WinProducer) or poor quality (Windows Movie Maker) when using other programs.   I was very surprised to find that the bundled Ulead DVD Movie Factory Suite performed flawlessy!  I have now been backing up many home movies and VHS tapes to DVD without any problems!  The only drawbacks to this drive are that:  1- I've been making so many DVDs that I keep having to go buy more blanks! (I think I'm addicted) 2- It takes a few minutes to recognize an SVCD when inserted (?).   Aside from that, this drive is a great performer at a great price! This has turned out to be exactly what I needed for what I want to do! The only way to beat it is to go with the newer, faster (more expensive) model and find a cheap source of DVD-Rs.
