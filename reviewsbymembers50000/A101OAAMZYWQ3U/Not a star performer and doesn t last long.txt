 I had this receiver for about 2 years before it died. Movies sounded fine with this however the clarity of sound was poor (characteristic of SONY).  I didn't know how good my JBL speakers could sound until I bought a new receiver to replace this one (only 2yrs old!!!!) My biggest complaint with this thing was that it completely died after ~2yrs of using it ~1hr per day! Do yourself a favor and purchase a Pioneer or Yamaha receiver that will not only sound better but they should last for 10+ years!!
