 Were it set at a bit lower price I would have to give this 5 stars.  This accessory allows provides the following benefits:   -Portrait grip with shutter release- for shooting vertically   -Speeds up the Autofocus   -On-board flash recycles faster   -Shoot more shots without having to change the battery   -Allows one to use the remote cable shutter release.    I, along with others, feel that while this adds some bulk to the camera, it is in the right places and feels quite nice especially if using longer/brighter lenses.
