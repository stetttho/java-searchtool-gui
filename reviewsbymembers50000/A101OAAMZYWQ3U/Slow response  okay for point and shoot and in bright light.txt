 This camera has a very annoying problem- when you push the button to take the picture there is about a half second delay before the picture is actually taken.  This is really NOT good if you are hoping to take pictures of kids, candid photos or pictures of anything in motion.  Other cameras are less expensive and don't have this horrible problem. Aside from this problem, if the picture is taken in bright light and at close range, the colors look wonderful.
