 I purchased this product after reading about "enhancements" to Photosuite4 Platinum (developed by MGI) which is a wonderful program.  Upon installing on my computer, I noticed that some of my favorite tools from the previous version were no longer part of the program while many of the "new and improved" features did not function properly at all - the "auto-fix" function consistently ruins any photo it is applied to and there are frequent program freezes and randon crashes.   I assumed that ROXIO would release an update patch (as most companies do when bugs are discovered in their software) but none were ever released.  Customer support offers NO support only a $35 charge to your credit card.   As the last nail in this program's coffin, I just noticed that ROXIO is now marketing a "NEW" version of the program (version 7 platinum).  This is rather interesting considering that the previous version NEVER FUNCTIONED correctly and there was absolutely no effort on ROXIO's part to support my $50 investment in their defective product. Do yourself a favor and RUN from this program by ROXIO. Even with Roxio's marketing efforts, this program was ABANDONED by them in under 1 year!  p.s. what makes you think that the next product they try to sell you will actually work?
