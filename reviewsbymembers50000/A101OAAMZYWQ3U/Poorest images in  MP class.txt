 This camera gives images great color depth BUT images are of poor quality with respect to noise, artifacting, and being grainy. Also, the camera has a VERY slow shutter!  Don't count on ever getting a child's smile with this one. In addition, the camera uses up a set of batteries within ~40 shots! (even with the LCD viewer turned off!)
