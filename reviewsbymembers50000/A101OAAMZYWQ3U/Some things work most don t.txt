 I was very disappointed with the functionality and performance of this product. For the first few months after I purchased Studio AV/DV Deluxe I had NUMEROUS crashes and much of the program didn't work.  After pinnacle released a few patches and instructed me to "clean my registry" to update things I got some things working better however nothing works quite as promised. I still have yet to get this to encode things in motion-JPEG format as the package indicated it could! The program let me capture video (after hours of tweaking settings and disabling other programs) at a fairly high data rate (high quality video) however when I went to burn the footage onto DVD, the program would automatically RE-encode everything at a very LOW data rate- resulting in fairly poor quality images.  One of the main reasons that I purchased this equipment was to archive home movies in a high quality format.  To date I have only been able to archive footage at low quality- even after months of discussion with customer support. I have had better luck using the crippled Ulead utility that came bundled with my DVD-burner that using this.  Save your money to buy something else.
