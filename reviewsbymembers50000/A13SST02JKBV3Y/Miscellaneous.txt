 This Cd offers a curious mixture of rhytmic suites and concertos and "early baroque" sonatas. The sonatas of Heinrich Bach are the less exciting moments of this Cd. You also have a 17 minutes piece of harpsichord solo of J.Chr.Bach which is quite long,and in my point of wiew,a little boring. The big surprise for me was to discover one sonata of Cyriacus Wilche (?) and another of Sighr.Pagh.(?) The latter give a real pleasure to the listener with an agressive virtuose violon. A crescendo full of vitality which explosed like a volcano ! Outstanding performances by the musicians. It's sound like the "Sonata a 5 (D. Becker) and perhaps more like the "Sonata Der Polnische Pracher" from J.V. Meder (Musica Baltica, Musica Antiqua Koln-R. Goebel, 1999, Archiv 459 619-2).  On the whole, this Cd let me perplexed. At least, we have the honnor to hear the master Goebel himself play violin !
