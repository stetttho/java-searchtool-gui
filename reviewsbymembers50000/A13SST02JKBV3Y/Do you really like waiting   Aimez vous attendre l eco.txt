 I know Biondi and Europa Galante since they were playing on the label Opus 111. I am a great fan of Europa galante. But...I was quite disappointed when I heard this CD. Mainly because I did not find Biondi the arrogant.  But he can't certainly not played like "a little electric tornado" in the "Concerto funebre". It's the same in Concerto "Per eco in lontano". I particularly hate this music with this boring echo;the same music which is repeated from " outer space". The Concerto "Il riposo.."is perfect to relax with the dog.  "L'inquietude" is outstanding. Even better than the Carmignola version on Divox Antiqua (1995). "La tempesta di mare" and La Notte" are enough strange and captivating to be considered as interesting performances. But they not be compared with the fabulous interpretation of Jean-Christophe Spinosi (Ensemble Matheus-2002-Label Naive). Finally the "Concerto for 2 cellos and orchestra" has already been recorded in 1993 by Europa Galante(album "Vivaldi Concerti" (Vol.22. Opus 111)). So no great surprise for me there. A very good CD to someone who want to discover Vivaldi with talentuous musicians.
