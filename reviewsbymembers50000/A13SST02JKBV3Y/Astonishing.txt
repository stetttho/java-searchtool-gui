 I never listened to these concertos of J.S. Bach played like that !  Pierre Hanta (hapsichord and conducting) is so perfect than I have to admitt he gave me the opportunity to love, as never before, some of the slow movements of those concertos. The adagio of BWV 1054 makes me cry with joy. Trully. And to be honnest, this recording of the 1044 is extremely different of the versions of "The English Consert" or of the " Musica Antiqua Kln" or of the most recent recording of "Akademie fr Alte Mucic of Berlin". The "Triple concerto" is so beautiful, so refreshing, so pure. Yes, Pierre Hanta and "Le Concert Franais " are the pureness at his summit. Not far from the Garden of Eden. The sound is also sublime. You"ll hear everything clearly. A great honour for me to listen to this french ensemble.
