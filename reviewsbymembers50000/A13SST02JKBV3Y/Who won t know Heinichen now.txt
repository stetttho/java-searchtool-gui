 Remember the fabulous album of Reinhard Goebel ten years ago ? (Archiv, Diapason d'or). He puts a name on someone who was unkown from the grand public. Heinichen has written some masterpiece which sound like the Great J.S. Bach concertos. The Ouvertures sound like Telemann. A lot of suprise, a lot of joy. Here, "Il fondamento" plays with fresness and a lot of enthusiasm. Frantic allegros. And we have the chance to hear some concertos and ouvertures that Goeble never played (one exception : Sieble 214). Just listen to the beautiful Concerto pour hautbois d'amour or the litte "vivaldian" concerto for violon . This CD is a must. The sound is not exceptional as it was the case in the Archiv Cd but it does not matter. The music is sublime !!!  And the musicians are very talented. Great Buy !!!
