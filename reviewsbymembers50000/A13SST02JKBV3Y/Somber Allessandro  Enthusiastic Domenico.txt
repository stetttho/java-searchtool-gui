 Europa Galante and Fabio Biondi give a very good performance of the most somber and sadness music they have ever recorded (in my own point of view). The concertos grossos of Alessandro are very hard to listen on one shot. You got the feeling that this music has been written for funeral parlour. Trully, If tou want to be disturbed on a sunny day, just listen to those shorts cuts in minor. Sadness and bitterness will emerge in your soul and you'll want to put it all in the wardrobe for a while.  In my case, I never listen to this CD except for the little moments of joynness containded in the very short "Sinfonias" of Domenico. The one which gives the most pleasure for the listener is the "Sinfonia in C major" (only 3 minutes 29 seconds...) This entertaining piece will help you to endure the 6 depressing concertos grossos of Allessandro. This CD has obtained a very good critic by the "revue Diapason" in there rewiew of 2002. When I will become a "connaisseur" I will understand. If I still have it...
