 Astonishing. Yes, truly surprising. I asked my disquaire : "Who's Dietrich Buxtehude?" He said to me "He was the idol of Bach ".  I said "You mean Jean-Sebastien Bach The Great ? "  "Of course..."  I red that J.S.B., on the pretext of a business trip to the north of Germany, has listened Buxtehude played organ for about three months. The "pice of rsistance" on the collection on this CD is the decidely unruly sonata in D minor, with its more and more surprising effects and fantasia-like free formal desigh. On the whole, the pieces are all, without exception, mature masterpieces, wich represent a high point lifes'work and at the same time a milestone in the history of German chamber music. Manfredo Kraemer and his ensemble (Harmonia mundi) gave an imaginative and well-balanced interpretation of those sonatas. In my own point of view, this recording is indispensable.
