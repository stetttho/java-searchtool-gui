 First, you'll notice that Goebel did not include the Ouverture number 5 on this CD. If you want to listen to it, you"ll have to buy the "Concerti per l'orchesta di Dresda" (Musica Antiqua Koln, R. Goebel, 1995, Archiv 447664-2). L'ouverture numro 5 is the most curious, disorienting and frantic piece I ever heard from Veracini. After listenig to the latter, I decided to buy the other ouvertures of Veracini which are on this CD. Trully, I was disappointed. Why ? Because this mucic gives me headaches and make me irritable. The main problem is that the movements are repetitives. Sometimes, I thought it was a perfect replica of the previous movement. Goebel should have recorded some concertos of Veracini and incorporated them between the ouvertures. The result would have been, perhaps, less aggressive for the listener.    Now the good points: the sound is rich, deep and the orchestra play with great autorithy.
