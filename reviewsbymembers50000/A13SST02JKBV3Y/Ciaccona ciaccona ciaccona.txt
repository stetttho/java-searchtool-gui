 The innocent purpose of this anthology is solely and simply to fill the general listener's cup in 3/4 time and open the door, for connoissor, to the 17th-century composer's workshop. But, as the title said, you 'll only listen to chaconnes for one hour! It' quite long in my own view. Goeble at the violin : I am very glad ! Good ! The sound: Extraordinaire ! Rich and deep ! The music ? Almost annoying...   Of course, they are somme exceptions : The music of Lully is entertaining and played with great enthusiast. The Chaconne of Corelli is sad, beautiful and fascinating. On the whole, this music is unfortunately vegetative and lethargic. Perfect to take a nap on a cloudy day.  Goebel should have insert some concertos between the Chaconnes. For example, Georg Muffat,who wrote the chaconne that appears on this CD, has written some concertos in A major, in d major and in G major (Muffat, Armonico tributo). Some movements are very crackling. It would have, perhaps, gave some joy at this recording.
