 At first, I had to be convinced. I have to admit it was long. Now it's done. Well done. Fabio Biondi is at his best in the "Concerto en sol mineur" (ddi  Pisendel(RV 319)". In "Concerto en ut majeur" (RV 558), Jean-Christophe Spinosi (do you know him and his ensemble "Matheus" (Naive)) was able to gave more surrealistic moments. But the Europa Galante version is very interesting. I give Biondi credits to let the other members of his "formidable" Europa Galante free to play like it was some "concertos grossos". A very good CD full of vitality. Virgin Veritas does it better than it was the case in the concertos grossos of Scarlatti (father and son.)Better sound. Biondi is a great virtuose. I am waiting for his next challenge. Vivaldi again ?
