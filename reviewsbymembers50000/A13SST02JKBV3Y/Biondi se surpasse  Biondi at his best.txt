 Well, Trevor Pinnock has met a very serious rival. For fifteen years, he was the King, now his work smells like an old cigar. I have been immediately surprised by this sublime and often deranging manner to bring this chef-d'oeuvre at this shizoprenic point (remember Reinhard Goebel and his fabulous interpretation of the third concerto brandbourgeois).  No interpretation can be compared by this outstanding performance (Forget Hogwood by the way.) The best Biondi ever created !! (and I d'ont like most of it) So, you like Baroque and vitality, you'll enjoy this CD. Even if Vigin Veritas ruined again the possibility to listen to this Cd at high level. "Naive" vould certainly do a lot better !! Let's see if Carmignola will convinced Marcon to interprete "L'estro" in 2003-2004.
