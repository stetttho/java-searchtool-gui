 First,I have to admit I am a maniac or ReinHard Goebel.He is the main master of some great moments in old and baroque music. What he did to change the spirit and the cadence of baroque music change my way of listening to this kind of music. You just have to listen to his interpretation of the concertos brandbourgeois. I had great attempt about this Cd. I was really disappointed. After tring a dozen times to love this music, I just have to say I never listened to it anymore. It's make me irritable and nervous. Just a matter of taste. It's difficult to be objective when you don't like this kind of music. The pieces I prefered are not from Lully but from Jacques Cordier (la bocanne primitive et compliquï¿½e ). I never find the authentic Goeble effect. Short cuts, strange puzzle. It's a movie music. That, perhaps, is the main problem. But the recording is deep, rich and includes some interesting surprises.  I prefered "Tous les matins du Monde" (Biondi and Savall)and  the music recorded on the free bonus Cd. To my own wiew, it has been a better choice.
