 First, Reinhard Goebel had a immense influence on my way to listen to baroque music. In fact, His "schzophrenic" interpretation of the Concertos branbougeois of J.S.B made a earthquake in my head. Since then, I am trying to buy everything he has recorded (a lot of his works are discontinued-and I still don't know why). These concertos are on this box set. M. Ted Libbey, chronicler from Amazon, wrote that this interpretation of the concertos was "laughable ". Does he seriously think that Jaap Ter Linden, Wilbert Hazelzet, Robert Hill and Reinhard Goebel, all very great soloist, are laughable?  Let's say we have severe divergences in the way of giving freshness and pure vitality in the interpretation of some "old classics".  This Box set is interesting in general but the main problem is the transition between the orchestral and the chamber mucic. After the climax of the tornado of the concertos (the "triple concerto" is excellent but I want to hear what the "Akademie fur Alte Music of Berlin" did with that recently), you have a (too)severe contrast with the chamber music. It'well done but the sound of the violon and the harpsichord is often irritant. I would have prefer the complete harpsichord concertos to make the transition. I paid about 85$ (canadian)for this box set and, to my own opinion, this price is too high for the quality of the sound recording of the chamber music.   So I would recommend you to listen with great attentivement to the chamber mucic before buying this Box set.  Lest's say five stars for the concertos and the orchestral suites and three stars for the chamber music.
