 After an anthology of the ascendants of J.S.B., Goebel is concernerd about his four sons. The most convincing moment of this Cd is the "Symphonie concertante pour violon et violoncelle", which is elegant and refined. A big surprise: "Le Concerto pour flte" of Wilhelm Frieedemann is astonishing. It is full of strenght ! The flautist,Verena Fischer,is radiant. The curious concerto of Johann Christoph Friedrich, for " hammerflgel, alto and orchestra" is strange and beautiful. You must hear Robert Hill (formidable at the hammerflgel) hold a dialogue with Reinhard Goebel (alto). This is delightful! The "Concerto pour pianoforte, clavecin et orchestre" of Carl Philipp Emmanuel is the most known piece of this CD. Goebel and his brilliant soloist are palying with a frenzy spirit ! Very stimulating CD !    The sound is deep and delicious ! Archiv does it again. Goebel too.
