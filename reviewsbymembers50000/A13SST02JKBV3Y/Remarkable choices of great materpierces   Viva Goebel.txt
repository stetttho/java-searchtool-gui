 This is probably one of my favorite CD(even if Goebel does not play violin or alto in neither of the peieces ). Trully, I was happy to discover Heinnichen, Dieupart, Fash, Pisendel,Quantz and Veracini. Of course,Vivaldi and Biondi made me discovered Pisendel before, but not in this way. For those who did not buy the double Cds of Heinichen (which his highly recommanded by the critics and sell at high price too) recorded by Goebel, it's your chance to listen to some of his works. You will enjoy the concerto en fa majeur and the beautiful pastorale. On the whole, all the music recorded there is abolutely sublime. The concertos of Fasch and Quantz are so pleasant to hear that you won't be bored to listen to them again and again. The sonata of Pisendel is, at first, dramatic. But the second movement is brilliant and powerfull. The ouverture of Veracini recorded there is, at my own point of wiew, far more interesting than the Cd dedicated to this composer that Goebel recodered in 1994. Its'full of surprises, dynamism and very fast movements. A little tornado. The latter gives not the impression (fortunately)that it's the same music that is constantly repeated like it was the case in the recording dedicated to five concertos of Veracini that I will critic with severity in my next review (Veracini,5 Ouvertures, MAK, R. Goebel, Archiv) So, I recommend highly this invigorating CD.  Vive le Baroque at high intensity!
