 I did not know Jean-Marie Leclair before. But I knew Monica Huggett( her outstanding interpretation of the Four Seasons-probably the best one) and Claire Guimond. This Cd is full of interest and never boring. Hugget surpised me a lot. She is a great virtuose of Baroque violin ( sometimes I thought it was Biondi playing).  Very freh and exciting interpretation of these concertos.  Why four stars? Because of the sound. The label ATMA I hope, will do better in a few years. The sound is not enough clear and profound. But the music is so enthusiastic !!! What a great gift !!!
