 William Lawes is condidered by many as the genuis of english music. Some music-lovers think that he is the central link of a serial of composers like Tallis and Purcell. The greater part of his production is the "Consorts sets in Five & Six Parts".  This music has no ambition to amuse the grand public. Jordi Savall and his musicians put all of their great talent to prove it. In fact, those CDS are the most annoying and unattractive albums I ever bought. Lawes is the champion of stagnation. The connaisseurs who love this kind of music should be like Ted Libbey (the one and only Amazon chronicler who think Reinhard Goebel is schizoprenic and untalented).    I have found this music extremely contemplative and, truly, deadly dull. The main problem is that you have the feeling of hearing always the same consort time after time. Like a perfect replica...And the time is extremely long in this platonic exercice of patience.  A long  unvarying phrase...Nothing vill never happen. Time is stopped. The sun is obscured by clouds. A somber whisper...  Those CDS are sold at high price. So be prudent. Listen to the first one carefully. Then, go to the other one and wait...This is the only thing you"ll have to do. In my own case,I returned those CDS (with great difficulties ) to my disquaire who did not want to take it back ! Maybe he knew no one would buy it !  All the critics I red (Diapason, Le Monde de la Musique...) considered this recording as a outstanding "chef d'oeuvre". They are all wrong : this music is ideal for two things: Take a nap or ...take a nap.
