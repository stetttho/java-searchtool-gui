 They told me this Cd was discontinued. It's true. I was looking for it since almost a year. Last month, on a sunny day, I visited my old "disquaire" which have used CDS. A surprise was waiting for me: "Le Parnasse Fran�ais" was there, alone. I bought it immediately. Now you have the chance to buy it from Amazon.com. Here, in my frozen country, my favorite classical radio station plays a lot of pieces from this album. All the music on this Cd offers great interest. You will enjoy Michel Corette and his "Concerto Comique no 25". Full of joy. Fresh air. "L'ouverture"of Jean-Marie Leclair is frenetic. You will also hear the young Goebel play "La Sonnerie de Sainte-Genevi�ve de Paris" of Marin Marais. A good opportunity to compare this piece with the recording of Biondi\Savall (Tous les Matins du monde,AliaVox) For the moment this Cd is my favorite with the very recent outstanding recording of "La Stravaganza" of Vivaldi (Rachel Podger, Channel classics, 2003)  So, do buy "Le Parnasse Fran�ais". Iam sure you'll love it as I do.
