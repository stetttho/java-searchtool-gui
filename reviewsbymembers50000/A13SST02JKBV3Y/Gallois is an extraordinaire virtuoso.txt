 This music is absolutely superb !! I did not know Gallois before. He is a great virtuoso. This music of C.P.E. is astonishing. A great discovery for me. But, of course, you have to love flute. This beautiful and rhythmic music is never agressive for the listener. And you'll have two CDs at a bargain price. I had some doubt about NAXOS recording. It has been confirmed after listening to this CdS on all of my CD players. The sound of the flute is very clear. But we can't heared the orchestra with clarity. The sound of orchestra, the strings in particular, is so unclear and bad that it's ruined most of the pleasure. NAXOS does it again !!! Poor label. Personnally, this is my last purchase of a NAXOS CD. On the whole, I give 5 stars for the performance of Patrice Gallois and 1 star for the NAXOS recording.
