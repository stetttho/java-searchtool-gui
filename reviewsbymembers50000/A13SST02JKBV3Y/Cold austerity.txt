 I am still wondering what was the purpose of The Great Goebel in recording this music. First, we have to endure ten minutes of the most annoying pieces Musica Antiqua Koln have ever recorded. Even the viola da gamba sound like clear violins. And then, the noisy trompete of Albrici ring brutally the bell in a flamboyant and majestic sonata ! Than again, an episode of cold darkness. We have to wait for the sonatas of Becker and especially the sonata of Meder to open our eyes. The latter is remarkable. A crescendo full of diversity and surprises ! This sonata is so attractive and so powerfull! A masterpiece to dicover. The musicians are phenomenal !  The sound is deep and rich.  An other Cd of Goebel that let me perplexeed ! Too perplexed ! On the whole, I was deceived. Too disoriented and dark. Trully you'll find cold darkness there.   Be prudent ! It'chilly but well done.
