 Very young Goebel recorded this Cd for Archiv In 1977-80. The new collection "Blue Archiv" did a superb job in the digitally remasterig of the old tracs. The sound is rich and deep. The muic is played with the Goebel way : full of frenzied vitality.  I just can agree with the Gramophone critic "This is one of the very best Vivaldi recitals I have heard for a long while." At this low price, this Cd is a must. You will enjoy it !
