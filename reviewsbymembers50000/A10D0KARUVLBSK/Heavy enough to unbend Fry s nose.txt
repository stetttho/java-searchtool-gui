 Fry's autobiography, eagerly anticipated by this critic, is suberb. His prose is masterful, and he unravels the morass of his childhood and adolescence with such candor, it would be wrenching for any sensitive  reader. The term 'misspent youth' would hardly suffice. While the empathy  of this reader only lasted up to a point (I just can't fathom somebody  stealing from his parents and sleeping at night), Fry captures the sense of  defeatism many experience in their youth, having given up on life and  lingering on in misery in a seemingly indifferent world. Though Fry's  experiences while attending British public schools may seem hackneyed or  even stereotypical, with the usual homosexual flirtations, his treatment of  it is comparable to and may even surpass R. Adams's The Day Gone By. Most  readers, regardless of their sexual behavior, could surely relate to the  frustration, obsession, and hopefully joy that one feels, never more  strongly, in adolescence. My only criticism is Fry's occasional dalliance  with political and social proselytizing. Particularly irritating for me is  where he lists things which do or do not require an apology, as though he  fancies himself the supreme arbiter of what is right and wrong. He often  refers to the "self-righteousness of adolescence," though he  withholds comment on the middle-aged self-righteousness shown herein.
