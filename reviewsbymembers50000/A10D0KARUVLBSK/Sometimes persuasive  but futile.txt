 Wendy Shalit's basic thesis confirmed what I have long thought obvious; a fact that many misguided women refuse to face. The sexual revolution liberated men, not the other way around. When there is no quid pro quo, men  can become sexually fulfilled without being burdened by built-in social  mores and responsibilities that had once been foisted upon them. Ask  yourselves, who has paid the price for the explosion of narcissism,  divorce, and illegitimacy? I can personally attest that it isn't men. At  the same time, women have never been more objectified and belittled by the  mass media, have never suffered the kinds of weight issues, eating  disorders, and insecurity about their looks to the extent they do today.  Too often, girls are led to think that their personal value is a function  of their sexuality. Despite the dubiousness of some her citations (She  quotes letters from women's magazines and classmates of hers at Williams,  which from her description sounds more like an institutional orgy than a  school), she succeeds in the simple task of illustrating innumerable  examples of the consequences of living in a sex-saturated society.  Having  pointed out such obvious facts, Shalit's argument ultimately seems futile  in imagining that there's any going back. Can you think of any society that  ever regained lost innocence? If you can't legislate morality, what chance  does morality have?
