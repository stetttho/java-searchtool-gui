 Don't get me wrong, in the past I've praised Stephen Fry's impressive command of the language to the hilt. His transition from silly comedian to silly novelist was a tour de force. If it was difficult to take him  seriously as a writer at first, his literary credibility is unquestioned  now. However, this particular effort is a disappointment after the  unapproachable genius of his first, The Liar. I often marvel at the  pretension of writers who try to construct an alternative history. Making  History suffers the same pitfalls as Newt Gingrich's 1945, that other  embarrassing vanity tome. Suspension of disbelief notwithstanding, Fry's  vision of a non-Hitlerian world is preposterous.  It cynically suggests  that Hitler was no more evil than the next person, and the world could have  been worse off (i.e. less politically correct) without him. What does this  say about Fry's view of the German people, that he imagines that someone  even more odious might have taken Hitler's place? He should go back to  doing comedy with that other literary wanna-be, Hugh Laurie. As for this  book, it is amusing, though not intentionally. It should have been called  "Making Up History."
