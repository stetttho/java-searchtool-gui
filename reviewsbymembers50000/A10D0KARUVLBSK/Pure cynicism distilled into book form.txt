 Bierce's misanthropy and glorious cynicism remain a breath of fresh air, never having lost their ring of truth for the better part of a century. His aversion for hypocrisy, formal education (He was of humble origins and  self-educated), and religious self-righteousness are appropriately barbed.  His disillusionment with concepts such as patriotism ("The first  refuge of a scoundrel"), are particularly interesting, considering his  rural midwestern upbringing and heroic service in the Civil War. The most  consistent and I think interesting theme throughout this volume is his  disdain for the institution of marriage. Long before marriage was seen by  many as a burden and divorce became unstigmatized and commonplace, Bierce's  definition seems prophetic for his time: "An institution consisting of  a master, a mistress, and two slaves, making in all two."
