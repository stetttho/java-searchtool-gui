 Howard Stern is an American icon. There is no denying it. I read every blasphemous page of Miss America. It made me feel belittled, sullied, and degraded; and I loved it. From his quest to become a gubernatorial rubber  stamp for the death penalty in New York to his almost adulterous encounters  with trolls posing as on-line goddesses to his pitiful enslavement to  obsessive-compulsive dementia, I found this book to be enormously  therapeutic in showing that Howard's life is even more pathetic than my  own. While it may be yet another slap in the face to his long suffering  wife, it is an important step in Stern's eventual monopoly of American  popular culture. I would rank this book alongside Bocaccio's Decameron as  the most significant dirty book to come along in the last thousand years.
