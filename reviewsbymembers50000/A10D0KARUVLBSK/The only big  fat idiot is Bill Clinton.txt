 I've never found Limbaugh to be particularly intelligent or persuasive, and have long been mystified by his popularity, but unlike Al Franken, I have nothing against the man. I just don't see how a guy on the radio with  no political power other than his ability to influence people who are  conservative anyway could be dangerous for the country. The few people who  still interpret the first amendment literally should see nothing wrong with  Rush Limbaugh having the opportunity to express his views. Anyone who  disagrees with them should simply not listen. There are conservative radio  hosts out there who are a thousand times more obnoxious and offensive, yet  liberals like Al Franken all seem to reserve their ire for Rush. The only  difference between him and other conservative talk show hosts is that he is  popular, which I think is the real reason people hate him. They envy his  popularity. Al Franken, who is too much of an ignoramus to substantively  disprove Limbaugh's rhetoric, devotes most of his so-called book to name  calling, which only proves that he has no talent for satire. And how  hypocritical is it for him to criticize Rush for making fun of Chelsea  Clinton's looks when Saturday Night Live did the same thing? Though he  seems to admit that hypocrisy was his goal, saying that he wanted to add to  the incivility of public discourse, my opinion is that Al Franken is not  incensed so much by the obesity of Rush Limbaugh, but by the obesity of  Rush Limbaugh's wallet.
