 When I heard Pat mention this book in an interview on C-Span, I immediately shuttled myself off to the library. It was published in the aftermath of Watergate, and Pat's tone is understandably disgruntled and  defeatist. I'm so tired of the liberal demagogues who label him a racist,  anti-semite, or misogynist simply because they know that is the simplest  and most spineless way to destroy a person's credibility. For anyone  willing to go to the trouble to find this forgotten masterpiece, I swear  that he actually refers to the early civil rights leaders as  "heroes," and writes that "justice was on their side."  How can the extra chromosome left wing explain comments like this, when  they would have us believe that Pat Buchanan is satan? I saw nothing in  this book that I would deem to be insensitive or xenophobic. But in a  society where a guy can lose his job for saying "niggardly" I  guess anything can pass for racism now.
