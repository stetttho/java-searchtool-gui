 Everything Howard Stern has written or said on his radio show can be summed up in one sentence. It is all an attempt to cope with the frustration of living a life of monogamy and boredom outside the confines  of his broadcast booth. I don't know why he doesn't just give in to his  terminal horniness and dump his wife and kids. What does he care if he has  to give up half his money; what was he going to do with it anyway? The guy  lives like Howard Hughes. The message of Private Parts, apart from all the  raunchiness and filler that make up the bulk of it, can be discerned from  the section entitled "My Secret of Life," where he writes that  people should live the same boring, conservative, monogamous lifestyle he  does. Even with his wealth and fame, even with the hordes of women half his  age who throw themselves at his feet, Howard wants the rest of us to be as  miserable as he is? I just don't buy it. I think if Howard were as honest  as he would have us believe, his advice would be not to make the same  mistake he did, because you never know if you might become famous someday.  Imagine having to resist even for a minute what he has to resist every day!
