 I just have one question for the naysayers who give this one star and one or two ad hominem attacks to justify it. Why is it that your reviews are  mostly one sentence long, with no information as to what is specifically  wrong with the book? It makes me doubt whether you actually read it. And  for the reader who accused Rush of hypocrisy because he collected welfare  at one time, how does what he did in the past have any bearing on whether  he is right or wrong? The typical Rush Limbaugh critic immediately  ridicules him without discussing any actual issues, which is the problem  with much of what you seem to hear nowadays coming from the left. Instead  of attacking people, why don't we be civilized and go back to debating the  issues? Attack the message, not the messenger. To whoever wants to post any  further criticisms of this book, do us all a favor and explain WHY you  dislike it, WHY you think he's wrong, and WHY conservatives are all morons.  As for my own opinion of this book, I don't have much to add to what has  already been written. There is nothing unorthodox or unpredictable that I  can see. His arguments, however, are more supported by documentary evidence  than I had expected, though there is no proper citation or bibliography, so  it's anybody's guess whether his sources actually exist.
