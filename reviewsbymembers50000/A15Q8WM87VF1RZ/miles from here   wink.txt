 She's done it again!  A totally chill stream of tunes that will boggle the brainstem while at the same time massaging it - this album is like candy, baby -- sweetness!  If you are new to Solex, this is as good a place to start as any.  But definately PICK-UP the back catalogue if you dig 'the laughing stock..."  Solex crafts tripped-out sound cubes that when placed on the eardrum melt into colorful beat vibrations and dissolve into your consciousness.  If you're up for the absorbtion, her smooth vocals and playful bubbles of sound-waves will prove to be your cup of tea.  One might sit about with a flask of brandy or cognac to sipple upon while spinning a disc from this wonderland-wiz.  I mean, she's from Amsterdam, so its gotta be somewhat off-the-wall.       Not sure if this is trip-hop, experimental, indie rock, dance or somewhere in between....its just SOLEX.  And I can't wait to see her live in Chapel Hill next month.  I think I'll wear a shirt that says "Jack Daniels" and a hat that says "I love you".
