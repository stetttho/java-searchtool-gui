 Hum fans should enjoy Centaur.  It is less punchy or poppy than Hum in that there are no hooks or refrains, which I think is a good thing.  The songs have an ambient kind of groove. The thick fuzz of guitar riffs creep along appropriately with singer Matt Talbot's echoing reverberated vocals.  His voice seems sad and lonesome.  If you enjoy HUM, Matt's previous band, you should enjoy this, although CENTAUR is clearly a band of their own. This music is somewhat more mellow.  Most of the drumming is less frantic and basically more straightforward and Matt never belts out any of of his strained screams and hollers which always make me feel good. But this will clearly be my pick for a dreary rainy day or if I want to fall asleep w/ my headphones on.
