 AWESOME!!! I won this record on Vinyl down in Austin at South by Southwest at a "Cake Walk" for the handicapped conducted by fake Boy-Scouts?! Almost threw it away because I didn't feel like holding onto it while Enon rocked the stage...but man am I glad I kept it! This record sounded great spinning on my turntable with their cool, layed-back melodies drifting through the empty rooms in my apartment. Slowly, the record took over and I couldn't get the songs out of my head and couldn't help the hair-raising feeling of the mood this record creates. When it ends, you want more! Its an aural delight from start to finish - simple yet complex. Clean guitars, punchy bass which plays lead through most of the songs, hot drum beats, subtle keys and awesome emotive vocals-- all these elements pumping strong to create the heart that is PinBack. Their live show was quite moving and pleasing to my meager human ears. I have since collected the entire PinBack collection but SIA resonnates most deeply to me. Well played and produced Indie Rock for fans of the mellower Sunny Day... Team Sleep, Modest Mouse,...hard to compare really. A worthy purchase!
