 This movie rocks! I caught it on late-nite HBO long, long ago and still, to this day, some of the lines from this film are deeply rooted into my demented psyche:  "I JUST LOVE THE CHOCOLATEY GOODNESS!" "I MEAN, WHAT WOULD THEY DO WITH ALL THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DEAD BODIES?" "I CANNOT HEAR YOU BROTHERS & SISTERS?!" "I WANNA DIE! LET'S ALL DIE!" "L.A. IS LIKE NOWHERE - EVERYONE HERE IS LOST" "I'D RATHER HAVE MY BALL HAIRS BURNED OFF WITH AN ACETALINE TORCH"  This $hit is funny and full of a colorful cast of dysfunkional characters. Ruthless until the end and the only thing i don't get is what's up with that evil clown dude carrying the dead dog?!? That's cool as heck but was Zero just hallucinating or what? hahaha
