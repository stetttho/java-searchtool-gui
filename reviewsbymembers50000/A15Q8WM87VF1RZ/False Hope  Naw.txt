 Yes, I too was baffled at first listen - even second and third listen - why didn't they just change their name or do something clever like change it to false-hope or something dumb like that - anyway, its definately a different band but some good songs on here and i can't quit listening to them.  Track 1 rules - 'THE ONE' is a song i wanted to hate but here i am singing it in my head every day for no reason. Catchy? mmmm, well no. The songs are slow and tortured - wanna say emo, but not emo like dashboard - emo like...well i dunno.  I think they're unique.  They obviously try and mimic their idols HUM with the guitar tones and tunings. And its delicious to my ears. They can still jam a few of the oldies live so there IS still HOPE everyone - Look for them on The Warped tour.  I wonder what the next CD will sound like? maybe that's their plan - to keep us wondering - muah ha ha ha
