 Seeing Bile live got me interested - they opened for pigface and totally blew them away - its like a death-rave with lots of smoke and strobe lights - a totally disorienting aural experience with thick, riffing guitars and fast, hard-hitting industrial beats. sometimes noise, sometimes well-crafted songs - always loud, distorted and disturbing. Demonic Electronic is marked with finer recording & quality sound which is sure to give your system a workout - lots of bass, fuzz, beats and songs about satan - can't go wrong there
