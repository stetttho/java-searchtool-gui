 Track4 (mordecai) is the perfect song. First time you hear it, its all over the place and hard to follow - reminds me of my last girlfriend with its bipolar nature; it climaxes from madness and splooges into an alternative dream - their guitar tones are crisp and perfect. Followed by tracks 5 & 6, those are your only chances to catch a breath before being plummetted back into heaven & hell all over again. Track 1 has riffing that will make hairs yank themselves right out of your neck-skin. I am ashamed of my own guitar-playing when i listen to this band (sniff sniff). Great growls, screaming and, yes singing from lead vocalist. Its apparent they enjoy music outside of metal. Their live show is what made me take notice. I was too busy focusing on the drummer to do any thrashing - he really does play that $hit!!! yow - if there is hype, they deserve it.
