 This album is worth buying for track #1 alone -- and you might as well take #2 while you're at it.  Clutch rocks - always have and always will.  When you see or hear Clutch, you don't say, "Yeah, I think this rocks" and look around at everybody else -- you damn well know that it rocks; and if you don't know, I can't help you.  Look for their live album - supposed to be out Fall/Winter 2002.  Catch them live if you can.  They can take over the music industry at any moment and then they'll have too many poser fans and won't be able to play the small clubs anymore.  I hope not.  Clutch, thanks for the music.
