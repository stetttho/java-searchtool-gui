 Eli Roth further hones his visionary style of horror with HOSTEL, a buddy flick gone awry! Three travelers seek out sinful solitude in foreign territory and soon fall prey to a deceitful web of underground entrepreneurs. Unlike most horror films of the day, there is no damsel in distress... unless you count the guys. The whores who con them are as evil as they come, though, and beg little forgiveness for their deeds.  Those who realize how disjointed the process of film-making can be will appreciate what Roth has achieved in both CABIN FEVER and HOSTEL. The mood and tone of his films seamlessly shift from one extreme to the next as the movie progresses. There is generally no filler material and the pace is swift and relentless. Then he ends it with a horrifically satisfying blow to the chrome. Initially, HOSTEL it is a gradual descent into the unknown. Then, suddenly the floor drops out and you are faced with the grim matters at hand. Without giving details, I will say that this movie delivers on the gore (though you can ALWAYS have more gore), the disturbing sounds and images, the nudity and the explicit content. But it is also very entertaining, has a good story with good acting and, at times, is really funny. Anyone with a sick sense of a humor and a love for horror films is going to enjoy HOSTEL. And for those of you comparing this to porn? There's a couple fully frontal shots and several breasts - but nothing i'd consider pornographic in this day and age. Lighten up (:
