 Tracks 2 & 4 on disc 1 are insane - and are also the perfect songs - not perfect electro or ambient songs - just songs in general - a good album to get tweek'd to - also to have sex to - or both at the same time - its just so chill and weird and unlike anything you've ever heard - its pure art - sometimes calm and soothing, sometimes loud and jarring - a wondrous amalgamation of sound, rhythm and vibrations - a fun listen for electronic, ambient, trip-hop, experimental or other fans - i personally listen mostly to metal but i like this
