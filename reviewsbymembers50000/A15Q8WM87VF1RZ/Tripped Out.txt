 This DVD is basically the companion video to Cornelius' album, 'Point'.  The same songs in the same order in a kind of visual concept that you might depict in your mind when listening to the CD.  These are not your standard music videos.  They actually sync-up to the music as its played, almost Aphex Twin-esque, but less disturbing.  If one is in the right state of mind, you can almost be hypnotized by your TV screen at particular moments.  Watching it once is not enough and it is well worth the money if you are a fan of Cornelius' music.  You will never be more enticed with a little Japanese boy washing his face in the sink, I promise you.  And the remix CD that comes along with it is amazing.  Check it out!
