 This is one of my top 10 CDs of all time. Check out my other reviews and you'll probably be surprised. But this CD left a lasting impression on me when i was like 16 or so. It has some of the most well-crafted SY songs in my opinion and some of the sweetest, sublime, fuzzed out guitar sounds ever.  Track 1 is the perfect song. Track 2 (Junkie's Promise) rocks harder than anything they've ever done. They played it on Conan Obrien and tore it up!!! Track 3 is beautfully hypnotic in a tripped out sort of way. This is the track that first reeled me in as I was under the influence of Wild Irish Rose watching my friends play Tekken 2. Track 4 (washing machine) is a very episodical and visual song which morphs from dischordant punk to a chill summery breeze of a jam that slowly winds down into practically nothing. Kim Gordon's snotty tuff girl attitude shines through more than ever on songs like 'Little Trouble Girl' and 'Panty Lies'. How can any true fan of alternative music hate this CD? Good experimentation with noise and distortion, yet structured songs... better than previous "Expermmental Jet Set" album. Give it a whirl
