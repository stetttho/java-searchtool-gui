 Sometimes Sad, sometimes happy, most of the time somewhere in between. Dreamy, melodic and trance-inducing at times, Interpol top their previous album with an equally enjoyable listening experience. yes, there's alotta bands out there right now with layered clean guitar tones and reverberated vocals but Interpol is the best. Another chill CD best enjoyed with a flask of cognac and your favorite smoke. Chicks dig it too!
