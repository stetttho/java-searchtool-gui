 The Amazon.com review above was likely written by some geezer who shouldn't be listening to Spineshank anyway. If your idea of angry music is Black Sabbath or your idea of industrial/goth is NIN... well that's fine. But don't compare Spineshank. If anything, they'll get the nu-metal stamp. People seem to have to categorize everything. But nu-metal they are, I suppose, and someone has to be at the top of the heap, and that band would be Spineshank. If you're looking for deep insightful lyrics and mind-blowing musicianship that shatters the boundaries of everything you know, then you might need to dig a little deeper into prog-rock, experimental, etc... But if you want pure unadulterated jacked up alterna-metal with a techno twist, then Spineshank is the way to go! This album in particular rocks from start to finish, but be sure to get the special edition which has more songs. The extras are worth the money. I hear they are no longer together & thats too bad. Good muzik to drive and drink to - but not at the same time.
