 I think its apparent from all the reviews that Blast Tyrant is amazing.  I love the crunching SGs and the hi-energy vocals.  The sound quality is fantastic and the ride is smooth from start to finish.  I've been a fan for years and they've never let me down.  For a Hard Alternative without the Hate and a twist of Southern attitude, try out CLUTCH.  You will be pleased.  They got mad skillz.  Good Drinkin' Music.  Just Good Music!  Nothing compares.
