 Poor Dennis. He was more than slightly retarded. But as with many of the mentally challenged, he could see into the future. He knew that by biting down on Bert's infected flesh, it would somehow lead him to the tasty pancakes which he so desired.   No one really understands why Dennis is screaming about pancakes before he leaps off and takes a bite out of Burt, but if you watch carefully when Rider Strong's character is being wheeled through the hospital at the very end, he catches a glimpse of an eerie character in a passing hospital room, dressed as a giant rabbit, serving a heaping plate-full of pancakes to no other than, yes, little Dennis. Aww, one last treat before he rots away on his hospital bed. hahahaha  This movie is great. For Fans of Evil Dead, etc.
