 This album kills their last. This one is way more raw, loud and noisy. But also more melodic. They have managed to flesh out their sound and experiment enough to stand out from the rest of SCREAMO. More inspired than most, Glassjaw have an energy; a creative edge consisting of both brains and brauns. And the lead singer,...that mug can scream! They have made their mark in hardcore - with this album, they are well on their way to joining the ranks of alterna-metal pioneers/revolutionaries/extraordinaires such as Deftones, Hum, Tool... i know thats saying alot. But this album drips with ingenuity, art, and uncompromised sound - quenching my thirsty ears. GlassJaw continue to push the envelope...Can't wait for the next 1.
