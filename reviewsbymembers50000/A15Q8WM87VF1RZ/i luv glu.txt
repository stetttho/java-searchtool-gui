 i bought this cd way back when i was 15 and now i'm 25 - wow. i just listened to it again the other day for the first time in a while and i still must say, they were true innovators. i always remember thinking that his voice sounded like layne staley at first, but i got used to it and liked it. the sounds that were made on this album via synthesizers and drum machines were unique for its time. and it was one of those i would get trashed and listen to. sounds good with a buzz. good beats w/ crisp & crunchy guitar riffs. the thing about GLU that made them standout from the other techno-metal bands of time was the song-writing. each song feels inspired, has heart and means something. they don't sound like they were just trying to make a party-record or something. they proved their ingenuity with 'life in the so-called space age' and i'm just sad they are no longer around. i hear their solo efforts are decent though and look forward to checking them out. I was fortunate enough to catch their live show a couple times in charlotte, NC which was a cool b/c they played w/ a live drummer along w/the synthesizers and drum machines and of course the guitars were killer - thanks 4 the muzik
