 Ah yes, the classics from Pitchfork - it is Clutch at their most angry and aggressive - no need to downtune - the Bacchannal demo is cool b/c its a bit faster than the album version - one of their most THRASH-worthy songs and one of my personal faves - it shows CLuTch is still proud of their past and haven't forgotten their roaring roots - worth the spend for any true CLUTCH fan - They are Underground Legends
