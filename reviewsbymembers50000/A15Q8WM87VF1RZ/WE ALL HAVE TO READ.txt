 Dude, this rocks. In Flames are unlike any other. They have the heavy, the melody, the solos, the brash vocals... which all sounds pretty standard but nobody delivers it like this band. This album may not grab you at first listen if compared to their other albums, but it has a way of hooking you with clever riffs and lyrical screeching that will beat its way into your head- Perhaps its the swedish, almost celtic at times, influence (more so on WHORACLE album) - or apocalyptic, insightful lyrics.... i'm tired of talking about it. If you are even reading these reviews in consideration of purchasing this album, stop tormenting yourself and buy it - or burn a copy. Just get it- and get all their albums and check them out live and hail to the kings of metal and eat fried bread and like it you vermin!!!
