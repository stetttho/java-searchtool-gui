 I like 'Go Centipede' - a good dancing song - the album sounds very basic and skeletal to me - which isn't a bad thing - i would probably enjoy a remix album of this album more than the actual album, which would allow for longer songs and more experimentation - its nice that tommy was given the opportunity to make this cd, as he's got some good ideas - i know most BTBAM fans would probably crucify me for saying this, but i think it would be sweet if he incorporated more electronics into their music - not drum machines or beats, but just some blips or quirks or something here and there - i'm all for cutting muzik up and making something new - but they are already original enough i suppose - giles is ok - good background muzik to dry-hump wannabe goth chicks to, thats for sure - hee hee hee drink hennessey :-D
