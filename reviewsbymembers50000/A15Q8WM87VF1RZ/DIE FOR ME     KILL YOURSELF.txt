 i think the folks who say his voice sounds bad or worn out are simply confused - his voice tone is deliberate - this isn't supposed to be melodic death metal or anything - its more hardcore punk influenced than anything - his voice is fitting to the music and this album is very high energy and fast-paced - its raw and its a hailstorm of hatred and angst - indeed, i like this album - phil screeches like no other - 'personal insult' is the best song - it crunches and scrapes and changes pace a couple times and on top of it all, makes fun of JIHAD - hahaha
