 This CD will make you get up off the couch, drink in hand, and shake it, baby!! Yeah!!!  A totally groovy concoction of melodic dance rock, full of catchy sing-alongs and beat-driven rhythms, but well written and with meaning.  Its hard to classify b/c one second the disco ball's twirling and the next second you're back in the garage smashing beer cans on your forehead (or was that just me?)...oh well, the fact that I love Glassjaw probably aided my liking to this piece of music, but I'm glad it did. Good alternative/dance/punk/pop CD
