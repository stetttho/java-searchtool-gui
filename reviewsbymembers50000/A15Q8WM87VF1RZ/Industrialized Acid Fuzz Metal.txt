 This is cool - i wouldn't classify it as electronica but it fits that sort of mood the way they loop the drums and guitars over and over again. Its got an industrial feel to it but with more depth and warmth to the sound. the vocals are soft and eerie and pretty much indecipherable to me. its a good CD to put on repeat and let it play continuously. though the guitars are heavy, it is easy to fall asleep to. its a kind of meditation CD, trance-inducing, no real hooks or structure - sounds very experimental and fresh, which i like. check it out if you're open minded and like hearing new sounds. I'm a big fan of HUM so that is of course why I bought it. I knew there was some originality and talent behind it.
