 At War with the Mystics is clearly another triumph. 'The Sound of Failure' ALONE is worth the money. Its sad, then happy, then sublime, then eerie - but all in a subdued way that your ears will easily digest. Track 4 is beautiful, as is #5... then 6, oh man!!! What a stellar instrumental that injects the listener into a void of spaced out blips and high-tech synthesized pyschadelia - and such a mad groove it is. If only I had my own werewolf moccasins, i would dance..in a trance... with no pants  This album is like a sonic theatrical soundtrack to some science fiction drama... 'Yeah Yeah Yeah' is a great opener and 'Goin' On' is the perfect closer. It might even be the saddest, happiest and most well-written song on the album?  Where Yoshimi was more beat-driven, you may find the Mystics is more groove driven and the vast harmonies merit little need for excess boom in the bass. However you will find a fair share of their now trademarked boombox sound in tracks like 'Free Radicals' and 'The W.A.N.D."  Don't listen to it looking for the next Soft Bulletin or the next Yoshimi. Any true Lips fan knows and welcomes the element of surprise and creativity that comes w/ being a listener of their muzik. And we all know that they're not afraid to change or crawl out onto the limb of experimentation for the sake of making new sounds that melt into your mind like acid popsicle pie, mmmm. Its a slow-burn. Let it ease in and enjoy it. Pour yourself some cognac or have a couple white russians and let it overtake you, let it wake & bake you, let it master-slave you!!!!!
