 HUM REMAIN A FAVORITE BAND OF MINE WHOSE IMPRESSION WAS GREAT. AS A GUITARIST I RESPECT THE ART OF THEIR SONGWRITING AS WELL AS HEAVY INNOVATING IN THE ALTERNATIVE GENRE. NO ONE COMES CLOSE. SEEING THEM IN CONCERT IN '98 WAS BOTH STELLAR AND GROUNDBREAKING FOR MY MEAGER HUMAN EARS. I'VE NEVER THRASHED HARDER, EVEN AT TOOL, DEFTONES, BETWEEN THE BURIED AND ME, CLUTCH, DOWN, LAMB OF GOD, DARKEST HOUR...COUNTLESS OTHER HEADBANGERS -- NOTHING REELED ME IN LIKE HUM - MMMM - DELISH!
