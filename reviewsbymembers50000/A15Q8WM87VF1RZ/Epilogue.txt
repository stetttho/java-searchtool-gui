 Father & Son exit cabin door and proceed to forest path. A bruised and shaking Mother trails behind... ------------------------------------------------ Father speaks: Son, what's the matter?  Son: I grow hungry, Father, and more restless each day. But the visions keep coming and the music isn't helping...  Father: Take heed, if you exert these pinned up aggressions into raw musical form, you will expel these harsher feelings, then once again tap your lighter sensitivities  Son: I'm so confused...  Father: Soon, my son, soon...we will exit this hellish pit of misery into an outside world of wonder & amazement, where the skies are filled w/ fleets of chirping poultry -- singing the hymnals of happiness - further urging us to leave our worries in exile and follow them to the promised land.   Mother: pretty little leaves, pretty little bees...please tell me, where are all the pretty little things??  Son: Follow? follow who, Father? There's nothing here but this dying forest in which we live.  Father: The trees that surround us are consuming our every word - enveloping the negative energy that engulfs us everyday as we hopelessly trudge into impending nothingness....as their branches break, so does my heart, for the stems of my life have been severed -- i'm cut off from the world and bleeding profusely... mother, get the chainsaw -- we have work to do...  Son: Chainsaw? What is that for?  Father: That's between the buried and me.
