 People like to wine about how In Flames has changed. But can you name any band with 7 or 8 albums that all sound the same (besides punk bands)? They are artists, so why paint the same picture twice? Guitar tones, song structure, production style all may change. But In Flames continue to create original metal of the highest quality. The music is interesting and the lyrics are sometimes puzzling. But its nice to have a band that shows musicianship and creativity, yet not so progressively left-field that its a chore to listen to, like many artsy prog-rockers of the day. I need something I can listen to while driving, moshing, eating cereal or simply hunting zombies. I choose In Flames. When you get tired of listening to one album you can always grab another b/c it sounds different. Can't wait for the next one
