 haha, silliness. but refreshing. some of the hardcore elements are too familiar but they break the mold with their obvious love affair with low-tech synth. this will be every hardcore geek's favorite band, until the imitators follow. then it will be up to HORSE to ditch the hardcore for metal or perhaps industrial? we'll see. his vocals are terrible, but in a good way. no excess cheese like you would get from a band like trivium. maybe for fans of BTBAM, Giles, Poison the Well, MELVINS, Cornelius, Thrice, Fantomas, Dillinger Escape Plan, Aphex Twin, deftones, Tricky, Thursday... i dunno. they're kinda weird
