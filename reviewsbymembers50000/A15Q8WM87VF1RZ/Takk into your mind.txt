 they are truly one of a kind - there will surely be imitators - this is art, this is music and nothing compares - yes i need a little harcore or death metal from time to time, but when i want bliss and i want to be inspired, i choose sigur ros - sure i have no clue what they are saying, but I feel the mood - i usually have no clue what between the buried and me are saying either until i read the lyrics - but i still derive feeling from the music - open your windows and let the fresh breeze of sigur ros spill into your otherwise stuffy aural nodes (??as corny as that may sound) your membranes will thank you later. takk is beautiful
