 This one rocks. The riffs are huge...and FAST! How do they play so fast? Or maybe i'm just slow. They've got some killer solos on this one as well. I guess its like speed-metal with a punk influence, with a swedish twist... But the way music changes and influences everything else nowadays, there's really no use in trying to tag every band into a category. Darkest Hour have their own sound. They rock it live too, especially when they play alongside bands like Cursive. What a crazy show. I was the only one thrashing amongst a sea of Cursive fans.
