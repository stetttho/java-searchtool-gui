 cool beats and blips. inventive vocal stylings. sometimes catchy, sometimes weird, but it could be weirder. it sounded very foreign to me at first listen, but not so much now. still, i always like hearing fresh new sounds that make you wonder: am i supposed to be listening to this? I haven't thought like that since i heard The Streets' "A Grand Don't Come For Free". Pleasantly surprised here. Also a good party record. Very danceable for girlz and guyz. Look forward to more M.I.A.
