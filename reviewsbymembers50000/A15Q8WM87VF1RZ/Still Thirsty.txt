 Good CD to catch a buzz and zone out to when you're in a bad mood - of course all Tricky's CD's are like that, but i felt the previous release, BLOWBACK, grew old with continued listens - 'Vulnerable' however, gets better with each listen - 'Wait for God' is an extremely wicked song w/ a tight beat, crunchy riffs and dark overtones: "I wait for god, but its very hard. I drink your blood but i'm still thirsty.."   Tricky's creative hunger is never satiated and he will always be pushing the boundaries of mood, music and sound. A true artist
