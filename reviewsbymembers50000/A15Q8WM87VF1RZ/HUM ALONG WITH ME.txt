 Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm - yeah they're awesome - this album in particular - produced by Keith Cleversly - same dude who did Flaming Lips' "Transmissions../She don't use jelly" album so its got some trippy undertones - good guitar sounds & FX - very crunchy at times - very mellow & melodic at others - Too bad they're not still around b/c they were true innovators in alternative music during a time when everything sounded the same - before EMO was cool and when bands like Hootie ruled the airwaves - this album produced the single "STARS" and enabled the band to enjoy a fraction of the success they truly deserved - the songs are heartfelt and poetic - the riffs are huge and dominating - unique drumming w/ good sense of rhythm and all around brilliant song-structures - nothing too complicated but original and harmonious - its like HELMET took a chill pill, fell asleep and had a SIAMESE DREAM, then awoke to a SUNNY DAY REAL ESTATE - - then got into a spaceship and took off to find their long-lost love, only to return to earth empty-handed & decided to write some songs about it.
