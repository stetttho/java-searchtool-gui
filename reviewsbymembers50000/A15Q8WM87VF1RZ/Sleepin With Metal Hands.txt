 'Spirit Ditch' is haunting, beautiful and weird. 'Hammering the Cramps' is distorted and loud, equally as odd, yet happy and triumphant, too. The entire album is tainted with strange sounds and lyrics while at the same time, it glimmers with warm melodies and blissful tones. Its layed back, tripped out and psychadelic with a hillbilly aftertaste. Its like drinking absinthe, I suppose. Its a slowburn of an album that will grow on you, like all Sparklehorse albums do. I caught him playing solo when he opened for the Flaming Lips on the Yoshimi tour - Just him and his acoustic. Gotta respect him for the songwriting and big props for the sound of this album. A good catch from the mid-90's alternative era....
