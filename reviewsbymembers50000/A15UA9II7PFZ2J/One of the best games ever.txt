 Splinter cell is an example of one of those games that makes a system a "player". While the xbox is already a player, this game enhances a system that is in my opinion the best ever made. Fluent graphics and awesome frame rates adorn this game, which gives the player a sense of reality to the game. It makes you think that you are actually Sam Fisher on a top secret mission somewhere in an undisclosed location. I have been playing video games for a long time, and this is one of the best examples of how video games should be made that i have ever seen.
