 My father and i started listening to these books on book on tape about 4 years ago and let me tell you these tapes have encouraged and enriched my life. This is the eighth installment about the life of a band of Christians who come together after the second coming of Jesus Christ. In my opinion this is one of the best , it has non stop action and Biblical correctness to back it. I truly encourage anyone who reads this yo read this book.
