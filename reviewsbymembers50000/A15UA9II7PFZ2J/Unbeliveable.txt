 Alright, starting off this movie was more than i expected. It was set in the mid 1930's in Alabama with Tom Hanks playing an amazing prison guard assigned to "The green mile" the last strip of cells on death row. He meets an amazing black man who has a special talent in healing and who really struck me as a good man. He was charged with the rape and murder of two little girls but tom hanks knew he wasn't capable of committing such an act.
