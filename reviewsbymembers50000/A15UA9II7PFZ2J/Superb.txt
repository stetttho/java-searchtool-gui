 I haven't owned many calculators in my life time, and this is most likely the last calculator i will ever buy. Texas Instruments is a trusted name in the calculator business and they have out done them self with this upgraded version of the TI-83. This one has a sleeker screen and more options than its lower counterpart, and it will do just about everything.( IM not sure about Honors calculus though.)and on top of all that you can play games on it, it has excellent resolution for being a calculator, and it almost doubles for a handheld videogame system. I enjoy mine, and the 4 AAA batteries that last about 6 months won't leave you wanting more power.
