 Ok comng into this movie i will half to admit that i had high expectations for it. For example i had expected the sharks that they portrayed to be enormous enormous. They were fairly big but not as big as you would think. One thing that  stirrs up the plot is how smart the sharks are. Alright im getting ahead of myself the story takes place in the middle of the Atlantic ocean at a great white shark testing lab, where they are testing chemicals that will make sharks smarter. To make a long story short something goes wrong, the sharks get out, and eat alot of people, and there is LL cool J the cook to help save the day. I enjoyed this movie a bunch and it was very entertaining.
