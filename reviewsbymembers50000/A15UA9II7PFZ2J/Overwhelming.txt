 This movie struck close to home because i live in Charleston, and know all the landmarks that are presented in this movie. It is 1776 and the colinists of the new world have gone to war with England because of freedom and liberty, but there are sacrifices made by the men who fought in this campaign. Benjamin martin- portrayed by Mel Gidson- was a hero of the famous Wilderness campaign during the brutal French and indian war, and knows about warfare, his son wants to join the Continental army and fight for the pride of his country, but his father is hesistant to let him, and actually the son ends up joining without his father consent. Benjamin Martin ends up leading the South Carolina malitia into battle against the juggernaut army England, the milita, very underestimated, helps turn the tide of the war and the colonists hold out until their friends across the Atlantic, the French, come and help win the war in favor for the new country, America. This movie contains pure movie magic combined with,in my opinion, Mel Gibson's best performance yet to make a heart wrenching and touching story along with the realism of war that so often is lost in war movies.
