 Ok this movie begins with a man Andy Dufrane ( played by Tim Robbins ) who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover in cold blood. We never find out if he really did it, but personally i think he didn't. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison in the new england area. The time of the story is from the early 1950's - late 1960's. He meets a man named simply as Red ( played by Morgan Freeman ) who helps him out and becomes close friends with Andy. After serving almost 20 years of his sentence Andy tunnels through the walls to freedom and lives his dream of living next to the Pacific Ocean. Red soon comes up for parole and Andy leaves him some money and a letter at a secret spot to let him know that he would like his help starting a business on the west coast.
