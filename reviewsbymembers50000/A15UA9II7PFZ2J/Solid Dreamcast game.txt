 Even though Sega isn't producing anymore DC games, they managed to punch this one out before the end. Crazy Taxi 2 incorporates everything from Crazy Taxi 1, but with more features. Crazy Pyramid is a pyramid of challenges that you can try your hand at, and possibly win extra vehicles such as a baby carriage, and a push bike!! The levels are awesome in detail, and you can even jump into NY harbor and pick up people on the bottom of the harbor. There are also 4 Completely different people to choose from with different personalities and cars. The only qualm i have is the lack of hills this one doesn't have that the first one had. But overall this is an awesome game at an awesome price, pick it up today and have fun!!
