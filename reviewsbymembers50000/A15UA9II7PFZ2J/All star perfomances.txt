 Men of Honor is a true story of a colored boy who has always had a fascination with the water. Cuba Gooding Jr. portrays Carl Brashear in one of his best films yet in my opinion. Robert DeNiro plays Billy Sunday, a racist Master Chief Petty Officer in the Navy. Brashear joins the navy and strives to be one of the elite master divers who dive under the water to search for missing persons and underwater wreckages. Sunday puts Brashear through endless racist comments during his training. Brashear is singeled out among barracks full of white men and racists. He overcomes all these obstacles and after years of hard work in the navy becomes a master diver, and strives to achieve the rank of Master Chief Petty Officer, at the time, the only colored one. He achieves this goal, and is one of the most decorated men in Navy history.
