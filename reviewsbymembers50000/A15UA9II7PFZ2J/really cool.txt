 I just got this dvd playback kit for xbox for Christmas, and it is awesome how you can turn your xbox video game console into a dvd player in just seconds. You just plug the infared sensor into one of the controller ports, and your ready to go, just pop in the dvd of your choice and use the controller they provide to navigate. I recommend this to anyone who has an xbox and doesn't want to spend the [money] for a dvd player.
