 Braveheart is one of my most favorite films. It stars Mel Gibson in 12th Century Scotland fighting a gruling war with the English. Gibson portrays William Wallace, a hero for his country, but ultimately wants peace for his country, who fights bravely for Scotland in many Gory battles where he suffers personal losses as well as injury to himself. There is not much i can say about Braveheart, because most people know how good it is. I would recommed this movie to anyone who likes action mixed with drama and suspense at times.
