 I have been playing MOH games since the first one came out for PS1 5 years ago (you can read my review on it as well), and i can say from experience that this one is by far the best all around. MOH made the transition from PS2 to xbox with precision, and upgraded graphics. In this 3rd installment in the MOH series for console gaming, you get to partake in the greatest battle of any war in history, Omaha beach. From the opening sequence where you come off the sea transporters to the closing sequence where you help end the german threat in Europe, the game is exquisite all the way through. Unique weapons, and increased AI give the game the most realisitc feel of any MOH game ever. Level interaction, and the best graphics i've ever seen (courtesy of an upgrage through the transition from PS2 to xbox) in a war game make make MOH Frontline one of the best games I, as an experienced gameer, have ever played
