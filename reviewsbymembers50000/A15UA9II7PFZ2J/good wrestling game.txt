 Legends of wrestling 2 is more for the old school wrestling fans. Alot of people won't recognize half of the names on LOW2's roster.There are 65 different wrestlers to unlock and acquire. The game has an excellent career mode with different promoters from diffenent regions of the country, old wrestling fans will appreciate this throwback to days of old. One think i do have is a problem with the difficulty, its weird, in that you don't know how much or less the difficulty will adjust with the setting you put it on, some wrestlers that shouldn't be able to beat you, beat you, and visa  versa. But all in all this is a good wrestling game for old and new wrestling fans.
