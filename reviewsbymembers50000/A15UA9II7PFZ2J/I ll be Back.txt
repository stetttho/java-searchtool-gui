 This movie contains Arnold Schwarzaneggar's best performance ever in my opinion. James cameron teamed up with arnold and linda hamilton to make one of the most famous scifi/action thrillers of all time. Basically the terminator comes back from the future to try to protect young John Connor from the new T-2000 model of the terminators. This movie contains more action than should be allowed on a movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this and kept me falling off my seat the whole duration of the movie.
