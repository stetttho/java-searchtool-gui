 Ok everybody this is the first serious WW2 game to come along, and it captivated America. From the scenes straight from saving private ryan to the sound that was almost erie this is an all around game.I personally own this game and can truly testify to the graphics, and personna that make up Medal of Honor. This game takes you beyond what you would expect from an aversge game, it takes you to the inner workings of the German war machine. You personally try to dismantle the nazis and try for the right of the Medal of Honor.
