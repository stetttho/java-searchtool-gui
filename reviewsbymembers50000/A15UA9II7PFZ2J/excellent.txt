 Dc talk has endured alot of hardships, trying to be a good Christian rock band and not selling out to secular music. This personally might be my favorite CD of theirs, it has Jesus Freak, Colored People, and Just between you and me. The lyrics personally are what got my attention, they praise God and also attract teens to know more about Him. The first time i heard a Dc talk song was on the radio, and i swear i thought it was a secular band, and told by dad to change the channel but has it turnrd out i was listening to Dc talk and it got me hooked and it will you too if you listen!
