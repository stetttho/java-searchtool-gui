 Alright, i am a military buff, and i know a good portrayl of a war or battle when i see it. Black hawk down is the story of 100 U.S. soldiers who were sent into mogadishu Somalia to extracate one of the warlords who had the taken over part of the city. We were outnumbered 10 to 1, and only the bravery and courage of our fighting military allowed us to prevail. After 2 black hawk helicopters went down, the soldiers were forced to fight non stop until help could arrive. In the end only 19 of our men were lost, to their 1000. Josh Hartnett gives a good portrayl of a cool, calm, and collected Sergeant Eversby. There were many outstanding supporting roles as well. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a true to rights war story.
