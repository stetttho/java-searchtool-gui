 I very muvh enjoyed this movie. If you will look at the rest of my reviews i have written 2 other reviews for the " left behind " books. I thought that the movie was excellent, but in my opinion rayford stelle was much younger than they portray him in the biiks, and Nicolea Carpathia didn't have the middle-eastern look that you wou;d expect him to have. But all in all i thoroughly enjoyed seeing the people you hear about and picture from the books.
