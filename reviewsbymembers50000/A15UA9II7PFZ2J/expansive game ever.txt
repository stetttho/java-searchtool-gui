 Ok, I have played Myst a good bit, so I can personally atest to the complexity of this game. I will half to admit, that I used the strategy guide a great deal to help me, because some parts were just impossible. First of all, you half to be extremely knowledgeable before you even attempt to play this game. There are things that i don't even understand, and im not dumb. But the most difficult thing is tying together little pieces of the game to figure out one piece of the puzzle. I really like this game, and have yet to beat it. The music is haunting almost, and makes you feel like you are there, walking in a realistic 3D enviorment surrounded by things that you have no idea what they are, but will tie into the game as it progresses. There are also 5 completly diffrent "Ages" : Myst island, The Selentic Age, The Stoneship age, The Mechanical Age, and The Channelwood Age. This is a very complex and difficult, and i would warn anybody who play it to be ready for a good challenge.
