 One thing i want to make clear before i get started is that this is not an outer space movie that involves tons of ailens killing people brutally like starship troopers. This movie is set around 2015 about the first space flight to mars. While there a group of U.S. astronauts find life there that doesn't want them and kills all of them but one who manages to survive by the plants that they brought with them producing oxygen. A rescue team is sent to discover what happened lead by the head astronaut ( Gary Sinese ) and his other partner ( Tim Robbins. ) They discover that the life on Mars holds the key to all civilazation and the head astronaut is taken to where all of creation suppsoedly began. I don't believe some of the things in this movie but it was very entertaining.
