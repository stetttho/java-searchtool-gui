 LOTR- The two towers, we all know it, we all know how good it is. The continuing saga of Frodo, sam, Aragon, and Gandolf, and their adventures. We learn from the second installation that the ring is growing deeper in Frodo, and that global war is imminent. This DVD gives you much more insight into the lives of the characters, and background information crucial to the understanding of the storyline. There is also tons of behind the scenes footage that is fascinating to watch. This is a great DVD, and I recommend this to all Lord of the Rings fans.
