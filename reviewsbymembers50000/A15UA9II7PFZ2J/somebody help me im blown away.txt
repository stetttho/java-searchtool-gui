 I  got this stereo system for a Christmas present, and let me tell you that it is the best stereo i have ever owned. From its theater quality sound, to its affordable price ( dor a stereo these days ) these are the components that make an awesome experience. This is my first time owning a CD player, and let me tell you that i have been spoiled on this. My dad listens to it as much as i do! To the components of it: it has a 3 way bass reflex speaker system with built in subwoofers, it also has a 3 CD chander and cassette deck with standard AM FM radio. It also comes complete with its own nifty remote. So pretty much you can get this stereo for about 50 bucks less here at amazon than at competing electronics stores. Also i have heard these other stereo syatems that have fancy chrome and 5 and 6 mini speakers that cost upwards of $500, that don't sound as good as this system for one third of the price. I highly reccommend this to anyone who is looking for an affordable stereo, and to those who are looking for a really great stereo also.
