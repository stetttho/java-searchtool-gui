 I played this game on a diffrent system and thought it was ok, but if you don't like that type of fighting, than this game is not for you. it is slowerpace than street fighter and it gets very technical at times. I personally didn't think very much of it but thought it had its redeaming qualities, like it had some good character selections, and you could play diffrent type fighters against each other. I.E sumo wrestler vs. tae kwan doe master. Overall its an ok game but if you don't like slow pace games i wouldn't reccommend this to you.
