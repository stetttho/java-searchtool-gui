 I watched Anchorman for the second time the other day after buying the unrated DVD edition. I really enjoyed it both times, the humor is on, and i believe this is will ferrell's best film to date. From subtle humor, to flat out crude humor, Anchorman will keep you laughing the whole time. Brick Tamland cracks me up everytime i hear him say "I love lamp". You too will be quoting lines til the end of the day. I really liked this movie, and will ferrell is the hottest comedic actor on the planet right now. Thanks for reading, and be sure to check this movie out if you haven't.
