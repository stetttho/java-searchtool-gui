 Mag lite flashlights to me are the best that are on the market today for the money. This 3 "C" cell flashlight is alot more lightweight than its heavier counterparts and is very bright, don't let its size fool you this is a very powerful flashlight and it is also constructed from high quality aircraft aluminum and is waterproof. I give it my full endorsement to anyone who is interested.
