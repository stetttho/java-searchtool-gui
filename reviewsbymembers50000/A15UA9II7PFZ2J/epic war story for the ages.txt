 I love to hear as much as i can about WW2 movies games etc. but when this came out i knew it was my mission to see it. The movie takes place as everybody knows in WW2, it is about a squadron of men,lead by tom hanks, who are sent to find a missing Private named James Francis Ryan. But before they can set out on their journey they half to get through hell, yeas I am talking about the beaches of Normandy. They manage to get through the devistation that awaits them on the beach and set out for Private Ryan whose two brothers were also killed , and the Army decided to give him Honorable Discharge as an act of good will towards him and his family. This movie is a tearjerker from the scenes of death, but it makes you realize that they gave their life for their country and you.
