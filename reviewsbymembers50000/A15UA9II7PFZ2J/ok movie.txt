 I thought this movie was alright, but right after deep impact came out bam this comes out. Same story meteor is headed for Earth, and a rogue band of oil miners from the middle of the Atlantic are going to save the world? Maybe this meteor was the size of Texas whoooo im shaking i guess deep impact's meteor wasn't big enough for them? But all in all i guees this movie was enjoyable.
