 Ok whoever reads this probably has seen this movie and doesn't need to know anything more about it. But for those who haven't seen it i think you will enjoy this. There really isn't a category to put Forest Gump under maybe drama? any category that it goes under it is a very deserving movie to be there. This movie starts off with a mentally retarted man ( Tom Hanks ) who retells his life story to people sitting at abus stop. To make a long story short he serves a term in Vietnam and recieves the medal of honor. he comes home to his girlfriend Jenny who he has never stopped loving, and at the end of the movie finds out that he is the father of Jenny's baby. Tis is an inspirational movie and i would reccomend it to movie goers of all kinds.
