 I have played xbox a couple of times now, and my opinion is that this is an excellent system that could be better. With a processor of over 700 Mhz, xbox should have 0 loading time, but the opposite is true. The loading time is very long, and irratic. Other than that, i think the games Microsoft is offering has potential, especially Halo. The graphics are unreal and for a first system, microsoft has outdone itself ( it took Nintendo 3 systems to get a winner "gamecube"). The lineup of games that are out, and yet to come, are very impressive and this particular bundle offers a mix of games that will impact different people. I reccommend this system to somebody who is willing to spend a few extra $$$ for a great system.
