 Now this is a hard review to write for a number of reasons, 1. i liked this movie from a historical point of view and from a Christian point of view, but it extremley hard to sit through. This movie tells the story of a man named Schindler who was working for the Germans during the Holocaust. ...Schindler has a heart for the Jews and decides to help as manty Jews as he can escape from the Nazi concentration camps. In my personally opinion this movie struck me as bitter sweet, bitter in tht sometimes you had to leave the room from the scenes of death and the haunting music, and also the use of black and white to portray the movie. And sweet in that it tells the story of a man who decided to do the right thing and help people he didn't know , but he did know that what he was doing was inhumane, and against everything that he believed in.
