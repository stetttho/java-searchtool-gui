 Alright this will most likely be the only time i will ever give a N64 game 5 stars, but for Goldeneye i eill make an exception. Ok Goldeneye was 64's jump into the world of high tech video game systems, but unfortunately they couldn't keep it up. This was a very solid 1st person shooter, excellent graphics , and not even repetitive secenary, what more could you ask for in a game? The weapons were great, maybe a little exaggerated at times, but over all good. Long levels and lots of them made this game excel in the lasting appeal category. Sound was good, but not having the cd quality sound os a PS or a DC hirt it a little. Unfortunately Goldeneye got a little smack in the face when everybody started comparing it to the flopped Perfect Dark game. But overall a great game and even though i am a die hard Playstation fan i still have a place in my heart for Goldeneye.
