 The sequal to MOH MOH2 Underground is almost better than the first, the story line is diffrent in that it is the beginning of WW2 this time not the end. You are Manon from the first who is working for the French resistance. You go around sabatoging everything and killing alot of Nazis! I haven't beaten it yey , because it is harder than its predecessor and longer too i might add. I would reccommend this to anyone WW2 fans, First person shooter fans, or somebody who likes a good challenge.
