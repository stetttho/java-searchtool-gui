 I will admit, i went into playing this game a little skeptical, because of the previous "Strike" games, but this one turned out to be the best yet. This game took me many hours to beat, you get many diffrent helicopters to choose from, as well as tanks and hovercrafts too to destroy buildings for fun, or to actually do the missions that will keep you playing for hours.
