 I personally own this game and can testify to how good it is. WWF attitude has eccellent character selection, and create a player mode....for its time. Unfortunately it is getting lost in the shadow of games like Smackdwon 2 with its quick executing of moves, unlike Attitude, and its enormous backstage area, unlike attitude. But on the good side it has some things other games don't, tag team Gauntlet and its huge hidden character selection that you are always trying to unlock. Great game, i would reccommend it to anyone who likes slowerpace games.
