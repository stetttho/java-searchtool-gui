 Ok first of all let me tell everyone who reads this that i am not a huge Star Wars fan like some people i know. But the beauty of these movies is that it was the first real science fiction movie that swept the nation by storm. George Lucas had very little money making episode 4 " A new hope " but he pulled out a masterpiece. Everyone pretty much knows the story line, Luke Skywalker( Mark Hamil ) seeks revenge on the empire for killing his aunt and uncle. Him and Obi Wan Kanobi buy a ride with the ever fiesty Han Solo( Harrison Ford ) to find princess the dangerd Princess Leia( Carrie Fischer.) The rest of the movie is pure genius at its best. I highly reccommend these classics that still are running hot just as they were 25 years ago.
