 Alot of war games try to make it on console systems, but somehow, they lack the fine-tuning needed to be a great game. But conflict desert storm breaks the mold when it comes to having a good war game for a console system. First of all, the experience system, which allows you to advance in rank and earn medals is a big plus for someone who likes the military (like myself). The graphics are very good, and the arsenal of weapons will make you happy as well. You also get to command you squad of Delta Force soldiers who will do anything you say. All in all, this game is very good, and i would recommend it to anyone who likes action games and appreciates the military.
