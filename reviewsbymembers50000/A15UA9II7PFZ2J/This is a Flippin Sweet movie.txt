 First off, i just want to say that i have never seen a movie recieve as much attention as Napoleon has. The word of mouth that kept it in the theaters for five months is unheard of, and it is in the top ten favorite movies that i have. Napoleon Dynamite is an unlikey hero, but in Preston Idaho, anything is possible. With is best friend Pedro, and his girl interest Deb, the slapstick humor, and off the wall bantor is hilarious, and the randomness will keep you laughing all the way to the second viewing. I believe that if you like randomness and people making Sweet moolah! you will love this movie. Ignore reviews that cite this as trash, and a waste of time, their taste in humor isn't refined enough to appreciate this movie anyways.
