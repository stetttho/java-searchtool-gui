 I have used 3rd party controllers for a while now, and this one by mad catz is by far the best. Though it is large, it has a rubberized grip, as well as two turbo buttons for fighting games. The range of motion on the toggle isn't as good as the original by sega, but there again, this is a 3rd party. I think it feels better because of its size, and the feel of the controller, as well as the lower price.
