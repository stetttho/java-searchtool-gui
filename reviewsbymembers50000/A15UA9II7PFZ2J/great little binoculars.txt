 I got one of these binoculars for Christmas and these are more powerful than another pair i had from a diffrent company. Bushnell is a trusted and powerful name in the binocular business and this model is small compact and very powerful for its size and price. The only gripe i have about it is that it there are two things you half to use to adjust the focus, so in other words one could be fuzzy when the other is clear, making the view a little distorted, but overall this is a great pair of binoculars by a trusted name, Bushnell.
