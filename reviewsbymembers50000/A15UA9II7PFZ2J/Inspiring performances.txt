 A Beautiful Mind is an example of the rare great hollywood movie with a true and real story attached. Russell Crowe portrays John Nash, a Genius in the field of advanced math and theories of science as well as our economic status. He is plagued with terrible hallucinations throughout his life. Throughout the entire movie you do not know if he is hallucinationg or the things you see are really there. Ron Howard and Brian Grazer along with an award winning cast of writers were able to capture Schizophrenia like no other movie has ever truly been able to do. Ed Harris delivers a suberb performance portraying the object of Nash's hallucinations as a CIA Agent using Nash to decode Russian messages. Nash believes everything he says and even follows it to the letter. Jennifer Connelly also delivers an award winning performace as Nash's faithful wife. She is with Nash through all of his problems and ulitmately cites her as his greatest achievement for all the help and love she gave him. I won't give up the end for you in case you haven't seen it yet, but i will say that it is a fitting ending for an award filled movie.
