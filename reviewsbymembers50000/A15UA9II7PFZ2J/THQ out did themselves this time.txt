 Ok, I have been playing wrestling games for a long time now. Sinece the first game for SNS to this new marvel of gaming technology, so I have seen how much the wrestling industry has improved. Just Bring It is a great example of "how to do" a wrestling game. The character animation is perfect and flawless. There are no obvious gliches or frame skipping, and the moves are much MUCH more fluent and expansive. There are multiple modes to playing such as TLC, Hell in a Cell, Ironman...etc. This game also offers more characters. Its great and i reccommend it to everyone who has a PS2.
