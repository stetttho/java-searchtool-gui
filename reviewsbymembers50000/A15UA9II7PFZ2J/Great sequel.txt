 Halo 2...What can i say, it is one of those games that is a phenomenon, it isn't perfect, it wasn't the "perfect" game that everybody expected, it has its flaws, but the reward of the enjoyable experience much outweighs any minor flaws that you might run into. After beating Halo 2, i decided to look into playing on Xbox live. Wow! Playing on xbox live adds dimension to the game experience and never seems to get old. I am a level 12 on xbox live, and have played close to 400 games, and i still can't wait to get on and play with my friends. The gameplay overall and graphics are twice as good as the first one, and i highly enjoy playing it.
