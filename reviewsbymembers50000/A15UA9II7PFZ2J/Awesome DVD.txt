 This is an awesome DvD that is packed with extra features including the making of "the matrix" and others. The main movie is great too with extra scenes deleted from tv, and enhanced picture. Obviously, we all know the story of the matirx, a man realizes that his world is a computer simulation, and a man named morpoheus is set to free him from the "program", because he believes he is the one who can put an end to it. This movie is awesome, and i can't wait until the sequal comes out this summer.
