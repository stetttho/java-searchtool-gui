 Signs is one of the best movies that i have seen in a long time, it encompass great suspense with a great specturm of acting to boast. The movie is set in a Pennsylvania farm town where a corn farmer, Mel Gibson (Who is a retired minister who left serving the Lord because his wife died), finds unusual singns made in his corn field one night. Without giving too much of the movie away, these signs pop up all over the world, and an interesting twist that runs throughout the movie is revealed at the end, which brings Mel Gibson back to his pastoral position.
