 I have been playing the MOH games for about 5 years ago, since its inception on the PS1 console. This recent installment, deemed "Rising Sun" puts the player in the shoes of corporal griffin during the events of Pearl harbor and beyond. The graphics are unbelievable in the first level aboard the USS California, but it seems that the falter just a little bit in the following levels. There are some glitches, and some slow frame rates, but all in all its pretty good. It is also apparent that Electronic Arts put some extra time into the animation of the ship, and the minute details are extraordinary. Like the detail of the barber pole in the barber shop. There are 9 levels which are pretty big, the weapons are nice and accurate to the time (check out the Welrod), and the story line is accurate to the real life events. All in all, its a solid MOH game, I don't think it quite lives up to the precedent set by Frontline, but what a precedent that is. How often do you get to storm the beaches of Normandy in a disturbingly realistic enviornment?
