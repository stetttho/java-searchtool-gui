 First off just let me tell you that these series of books have been a true inspiration to my life. I have listened to all of them on book on tape except the first one and they all are magnificently written. This is the sixth installment in the left behind series that tells the story af a group of Jesus Christ followers who come to Him after the second coming of Christ. This book in particular deals with the foretoled events of the assasination of the antichrist named Nicolea Carpathia. I personally enjoyed this book immensely and would reccommend it to anyone.
