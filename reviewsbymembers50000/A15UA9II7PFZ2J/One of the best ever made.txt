 Platoon is one of my favorite movies dealing with war. I am a war buff and an actual portrayl of war is something that i like to see in a good war movie. Platoon has awesome perfomnaces by william defoe, tom berenger, and a breakout performance by Charlie Sheen. There is no movie about Vietnam that is more realistic than Platoon. This movie is very much "not for the weak of heart". I liked it alot, and if your a realy war historian, or just an action fan, you will enjoy this movie right along side Saving Private Ryan.
