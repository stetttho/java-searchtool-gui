 This Cd is Dc Talk's 2nd greatest hits cd and it is the best in my opinion. It contains 19 of their best and most popular songs from Jesus Freak to Colored people, this cd has the goods. The makers of this cd have also thrown some screwballs into ths making of it by remixing some songs like Hardway and Say The Words, these songs are almost better than their orignal counterparts.  Dc Talk is my favorite band and i believe they will be making good Christian music for a long time.
