 I own one of these, and i can tell you that they are the most precisely controlled mouse's that i have ever used. The optical infared laser lets you "off the mouse pad", and on to new levels of use that a mouse has never seen before. You won't have to worry about skipping, or freezing, or dirt getting in the mouse anymore, because there is no ball! I highly reccommend this to all computer lovers.
