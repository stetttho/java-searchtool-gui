 I recevied this game for Christmas, and let me tell you it is one of the best games i have ever played. You are Kyle Katarn a Republic mercenary and former Jedi. you start off doing missions for the Republic until a dark Jedi named Dessen captures your partner Jan, and sends you on a quest to find her, which leads you back to Luke Skywalker to ask for your lightsaber back, which he handed over when he left the academy. You watch as Kyle regains all of his force powers, with a little help from the valley of the jedi, which plays a pivotal role in the storyline of the game. Without giving too much away, i can tell you that this game has awesome graphics, excellent AI, and the best lightstaber battles of any star wars game ever. period. I highly recommend this to people who love star wars, and follow the story of the "Expanded Universe" which is played out in this game.
