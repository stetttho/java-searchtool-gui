 Street fighter alpha 3 might be the best street fighter out there to date. It has awesome game modes cool levels and best of all its the never ending fun of a 2d fighter. The graphics are what you would expect froma 3d fighter a little choppy and an occasional glitch or two or maybe an occasional mergence of fighters but all in all its one of my favorite game out there. Ihave been an avis street fighter fan all the way back to the SNES version of street fighter 2 turbo! i would encourage anybody to get street fighter alpha 3 because its fun and hey its down to 20 bucks now!
