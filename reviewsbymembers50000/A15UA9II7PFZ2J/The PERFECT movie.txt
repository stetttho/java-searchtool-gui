 I went into watching this movie with very high expectations, and i will half to say that most of them are still in tact. I very much enjoyed this movie to very end, but the first part of the movie was a little slow going until it picked up the last 45 minutes or so. The movie is based on a true story about hurricane gloria that combines with a northeastern storm to create the " perfect storm. " George cloonet plays the role of the ship captain of the " Andrea Gail " who sails out to a notorious spot for good fishing, but also for bad weather they need to catch alot of fish because they have been coming up short the last couple of trips. The movie is a cliffhanger for about 20 minutes and im not gonna tell uoi the end because it is very good. Bye and thanks for reading.
