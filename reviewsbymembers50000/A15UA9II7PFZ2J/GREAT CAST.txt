 To start out with, this movie has Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, James Gardner,and Donald Sutherland as leading characters, so its already a hit. This movie deals with the perils of the pilots who flew for the Air Force, during its last days of testing supersonic air planes. Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood), and his crew were cheated out of flying into space with the newly developed NASA. But 40 years later Corvin and his team are asked to go into space and repair a Russian satellite that has Corvin's satellite technology in it. When they get to the satellite, it turns out that it is actually a nuclear weapons platform built in the Cold War by the Soviets, and if they don't stop it from entering in the Earth's atmosphere, it could launch the nukes! But heroically,Hawk (Tommy Lee Jones) sends the nukes into space, and in the process sacrifices his life. The shuttle makes it back to Earth in a wrecked state, and all turns out good. This movie contains humor mixed with drama and emotion, the special effects are awesome, and the supporting cast did a remarkable job of showing the main characters best points. I would reccomend this to anyone who likes space movies, and Clint Eastwood.
