 Gods and Generals is the best movie that i have ever seen on the Civil War. Lang's performance as Stonewall Jackson is unbelevable, and we should look his way during awards time. It was touted as being too long, but the length game it depth, and actually brought it to life by examining the personal lives of the characters. The battles are absolutely awesome, and there are some incredible supporting roles as well. Look for the other 2 parts of this awesome trilogy to make a huge splash with people who appreciate history as do I.
