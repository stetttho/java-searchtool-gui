 There are so many Bibles out there sometimes its hard to pick out which one you think is best for you. Well let me tell you that this version is awesome for teenagers of all ages. It has scripture walkthroughs of Bible characters such as Jesus and Paul. This book tells the story of the greatest story ever told, so i think its cool how they can change the wording to make it a little bit more understandable for most teens. This is an awesome Bible and i highly reccommend it.
