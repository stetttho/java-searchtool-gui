 Here is my second installment in my 3 part Star Trek reviews. This is the latest and 9th installment in the popular star trek series. This is a great movie, i don't hink it was quite as good as first contact, but nevertheless it was a great movie. It deals mainly about a small group of people who, 300 years ago , fled from their homeworld to start a better one on a new and deserted planet. So the people from the old world are dying and need the healing power that this new planet produces to save them. So Captain Jean-luc picard of the Enterprise steps in to save the when he believes the Federstion has made a bad mistake by halping the dying race, because the federstion wants to help the dying race move the people off of their planet. great movie i reccommend it.
