 WWF Smackdown 2 is the best wrestling game i have ever played, and the best playstation wrestling game to boot. From the endless choices of match modes ex. TLC match, casket match, and the famous HELL IN A CELL match. it has a complex create a player mode that enables you to fine tune your player to the letter. Another thing, the backstage areas. There are over 7 diffrent areas in the back you can go into, you can start in the ring and work your way back to the parking lot or visa versa. Also, there are 50 WWF superstars that will keep you enthralwed for hours. THQ stepped up a notch grom the first to make an awesome swqual that in my opinion is better than the first.
