 I have not personally read this book yet, but i have had first hand knowledge about how a little known man in 1st Chronicles made a prayer that affected millions around the country, this book has come up in more conversations than i can count, and it has inspired almost everyone i know who has read it. I would advise anyone who wants a more simple walk with God to read this book.
