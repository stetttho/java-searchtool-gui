 Playstation was the first system to come out with a way of storing multiple games' memory on one piece of technology. I personally own one and will most likely half to get another one because i am getting too many games for the 14 blocks of memory it will hold. I can speak for me and most likely for alot of people when i say that i take for granted how good the memory card is and how it truly will save you when you finally get past that "impossible" level.
