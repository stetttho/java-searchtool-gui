 Me and my dad have always enjoyed playing racing games. Well this game isn't any typical racing game, it has over 15 authentic tracks straight from the NASCAR circuit. It also has anough cars to satisfy any enthuisist. Also hidden racers and cars along with hidden tracks to be unlocked adds some variety to the gameplay. I enjoyed it and would reccommend it to anyone, also its only 20 bucks now!
