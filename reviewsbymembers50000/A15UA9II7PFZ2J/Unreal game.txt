 Halo is an example of a breakthrough in videogaming. I have been playing video games for about 10 years now, and halo is the best example of an all around game that i have seen to date. It has a superb storyline, graphics that haven't yet been riveled by any system, and unseen realism. You are a Marine sent to destroy a race called the covenant, i won't tell you the rest, buy the story plays out like a novel. The multiplayer feature on Halo has depth and invloves more levels that i have seen in a while. As of now, Halo is the best game on Xbox and one of the best games ever made by any system. Halo has done for Microsoft what Mario did for Nintendo, it is a system buyer, you by the system for the game. Halo is the reason that i have been playing video games for so long.
