 Charlotte Bates wishes for adventure in Karen Robards' MANNA FROM HEAVEN, and boy--does she get it!  Jake Crutcher falls to her from the night sky, and soon drug smugglers are hunting Charlie and Jake, fighting river currents and falling in love. In Andrea Kane's STONE COLD, Lindsey Hall is being threatened.  Someone doesn't want her the keep the mansion she has just inherited.  Could it be Nicholas Warner?  He wants the land and he wants Lindsey...but which does he want more? Addie Rivers, the beautiful librarian in Linda Anderson's ONCE IN A BLUE MOON, has a crush on Will Court, the handsome professor who's staying at her bed and breakfast.  Addie's book club friends have been turning up dead and she may be next.  Is it coincidence that the murders start up just when Will arrives in town? In 'TIL DEATH DO US PART by Mariah Stewart, model Valerie McAllister is attacked by a stalker.  She goes home to Montana and to Schuyler Hollister.  Sky and Val never had the chance to get together, first Sky always saw her as his friends' little sister, and then her job took her away.  Now they finally have the chance, but will the stalker come between them? I enjoyed all four stories in the WAIT UNTIL DARK anthology.  Great suspense, intrigue, adventure and romance in all.  I especially enjoyed Linda Anderson's ONCE IN A BLUE MOON.  I was lying in bed reading it last night, and I kept looking around my room making sure I was really alone.  I felt so silly, but that just goes to show that Ms. Anderson has created an exceptionally atmospheric story. If you are looking for a romance book that is heavy on the suspense and will keep you on the edge of your set, then you've found it in this anthology.  Go out and get your copy today!
