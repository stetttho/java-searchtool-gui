 American Phoebe Rafferty came to England to find a  husband.  She needs to marry in six weeks or she won't inherit Marsden Manor, an ancestral home she's only  seen in a painting.  Within a week, and only after  one meeting, she's found her man:  Stephen Lambert,  Duke of Badrick.  He's exciting, attractive and his  kisses make her feel things she's never felt before. The moment Stephen see Phoebe, he wants her as his  mistress.  Generations ago, the Badrick family line was cursed by a Gypsy woman and they are doomed to  unhappy, short-lived marriages.  Stephen has lost  two wives already and he's determined to never marry again. He will give Phoebe pleasure, jewels, a home; anything she desires, except love and marriage. POTENT CHARMS is made unique by having the Gypsy  curse be a point of conflict.  It's a first for me, and I loved it.  Smaller conflicts get resolved,  until all that is remaining between Phoebe and Stephen is this curse.  The characters are very believable. It doesn't matter if you or I believe in curses, Stephen does, and Ms. Waide has portrayed this  exceedingly well. I read POTENT CHARMS in one sitting.  It has a nice, even pace to it.  The sparks that fly between Phoebe  and Stephen are sexy, as are Stephen's displays of jealousy.  I found myself looking forward to both.   There are some historical tidbits throughout the book, but I never felt as if I were being taught a history lesson.  Ms. Waide has written a wonderful romance  reminding us that words do have power, inviting us to believe that maybe, "I love you" are the most powerful  words of all.
