 Discriminating cop, Mick Dawson can't get the woman out of his mind, and every time he sees her, his libido skyrockets.  It's been two weeks since he first laid eyes on her, and now is the time for him to finally make his move.  He has to see her up close and talk to her, so he follows her into a jewelry store. Mystery writer, Delilah Piper froze in fear when two armed robbers entered the jewelry store.  She was terrified when someone dragged her to the ground and covered her body with his, until she realized that the man was trying to protect her.  She was completely shocked when that same man took a bullet that was meant for her.   Thinking that Delilah is in jeopardy and wanting to protect her, Mick moves into her home.  Delilah, finding Mick heroic and unlike any other man she's ever met, welcomes him into her home and heart.  Things are heating up between these two, but what happens when the robber wakes up and says that Delilah was in on the heist? CAUGHT IN THE ACT is one sexy story!  The characters are bold and vital, with one not overshadowing the other.  Mick and Delilah were both the aggressors in the relationship, and I enjoyed that.  Mick knows that Delilah is "the one", before even meeting her, and it was nice to read about a guy who isn't running away from his feelings.  I was a little surprised that the sexual relationship started as rapidly and as intensely as it did, but Mick knows what he wants...and what he wants is Delilah.  Now, what you should want is this book...so go out and purchase your copy today!
