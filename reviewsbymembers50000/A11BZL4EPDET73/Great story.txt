 Shoe designer, Lili Kavanaugh just managed to escape an attempted kidnapping, and while she doesn't really think that she needs hunky bodyguard Matt Hawkins to guard her body-though she wouldn't mind him doing other things to it-she's resigned to the fact that he's here to stay.  Matt is instantly attracted to flirtatious Lili, and he knows that she's going to be trouble.  Trouble to his piece of mind and his libido!  He's never gotten involved with a client before, and he's determined not to start now.  Forced together, with emotions flying high, Matt finds that Lili's charms are too hard to resist.  Amidst trying to figure out the mystery of who is after Lili-and why, Matt and Lili must figure out their feelings for each other as well. HER BODYGUARD is one of the most entertaining and charming books I've read this year. Sparks fly between the flamboyant Lili, and the more reserved Matt, and it's wonderful to watch Lili try everything in the book to get a rise out of Matt.  (Wink! Wink!)  Lili is aggressive, yet very feminine, and I always like seeing that kind of balance in a female character.  The mystery, having to do with a 1930's gun moll's pair of shoes, was so unique and it created a wonderful base to the story. There was this one scene, just before Matt and Lili run away from the bad guys, where there is this intense and vivid gun battle, that frankly, I was enthralled by.  My heart was pounding and I actually held my breath!  It was so well written, I felt as if it were taking place right before my eyes.  HER BODYGUARD offers smart and sexy characters, a fun storyline and great writing, what else can a reader ask for?
