 Britta lives a solitary existence, haunted by events that happened five years ago.  She was raped and held for three days by her attackers.  Britta just wants to be alone, but she has the magical gift of healing, and the call of the wounded is undeniable. Karn, an invading Viking, is the only man left alive in his troop, but he's wounded and dying.  Britta is called in to heal Karn--just enough to keep him alive for the forthcoming torture.  Britta comes face to face with her past.  The men who are holding the Viking captive are the same men who raped her years ago. Britta steals away with the tortured and unconscious Karn, taking him to her island home where he starts to heal.  They slowly begin to know and trust each other.  Time is against them though, and soon they are fleeing the island.  They end up going their separate ways, but fate has other plans for these two.  They will meet up again, because love and destiny cannot be denied. DANEGELD is an epic tale about the force that formed England.   Readers need to be aware that there are male and female rape scenes, remembered and alluded to.  I thought that the story could have held up just as well with one rape, if any.  Aside from the rape issue, DANEGELD is really well written.  Ms. Squires has turned out a historically rich, well-paced novel.
