 Kate Bradshaw has turned sour on love...and that's not a good thing for a woman who writes a "Dear Cupid" advice column.  Since her divorce, Kate's column has become more cynical than romantic.  She can't seem to find her way back to that confident, loveable, flirty woman she once was.  Kate has built a wall around herself and her son, a wall that she has no intention of letting down. Michael Cameron knows what he's been missing in his life, Kate.   He fell for her the moment he saw her during a brief, flirty exchange in an airport lobby.  Convincing Kate will take some work though.  Michael hires her to find him a wife, not letting Kate know that he really has his sights set on only her. Thinking back after reading DEAR CUPID, what I remember most  were the emotional characters.  Kate is so afraid of being hurt, of taking another chance, that it blinds her to what is right in front of her: simply, a man who loves her.  It was frustrating o watch Kate time and again deny herself the love that we want her to grasp and hold on to--never letting go.  Lacking the courage and self-esteem to believe in Michael or herself, Kate must gain back her self-confidence before she can step forward and grab hold of the brass ring. Taking you from laughter to tears, while maybe opening you up to do some re-evaluating of your own, DEAR CUPID is a perfect summer read.
