 Elizabeth Trent doesn't know what to do.  She's about to walk down the aisle to marry the man of her dreams, Jonathan Hird, but she has a terrible secret.  She was raped and she is now pregnant.  She can't find the strength to tell him, so she ends up leaving Jonathan at the altar without a word or note. Hurt and humiliated, Jonathan sails from England and memories of Elizabeth.  He's been living as a pirate for the past two years and now he's back.  Stronger, dangerous and firm in his belief that he cares nothing for Elizabeth, he's talked into finding Elizabeth a suitable husband. Elizabeth and Jonathan meet again and they are still attracted to each other, but can Elizabeth make Jonathan see that the only suitable husband for her is him?  Will she ever find the courage to tell Jonathan the truth of why she left him at the altar? We first meet Elizabeth and Jonathan in THE DUKE'S LADY, a story about Elizabeth's twin brother, Adam.  The first few chapters in LOVE ONLY ONCE have some flashback scene which helps get the reader up to speed, after that it pretty much runs it course uninterrupted.  Ms. Jernigan set the story very nicely, creating a steady pace with a few surprises thrown in to shake things up a bit!
