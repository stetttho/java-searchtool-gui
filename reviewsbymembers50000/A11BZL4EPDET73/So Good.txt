 As a child, Brenna Fallon loved her dog so much, she invoked the spirit of Mars Nodens (a god of healing who favored hounds) to heal her dying, canine companion.  Years later, the sacred spot where she invoked the god is desecrated and a malevolent force is building, waiting to be unleashed.  That time is now. A dark and oppressive force, angry neighbors, vicious animal attacks, all hint at the approaching modern Black Death.  Before you know it, animals and people start dying.  Brenna, with the help of a handsome, mysterious stranger and a quirky stray dog, must find the strength to fight back against this evil plague.  For she's been having chilling glimpses into the future...and it's ugly. A FERAL DARKNESS has just enough romance in it to keep me satisfied.  When Brenna and Gil first meet, they don't even like each other.  While working together they start to learn things about the other person and fall in love.  The loves scenes are "G" rated, and it is so refreshing to read about the romance instead of where the couple jump into bed thirty seconds after meeting!  It was nice to see Brenna and Gil grow closer, and start to care for each other. Ms. Durgin does an amazing job with her characters, endowing them with little quirks that made them seem so alive, especially Druid, the stray dog.  If you like dogs, you'll fall in love with Druid, who is very charming and delightful.  Brenna is just a regular woman who is trying to deal with what is going on the best she can.  She is smart and intuitive, but she doesn't have all the answers and I liked her because of that. If you are looking for a book that has romance, some paranormal elements, is expertly written with wonderful characters and has a smooth pace that leads up to a climatic finish, A FERAL DARKNESS is the book for you and it is not to be missed.
