 A DEADLY EXCHANGE is a taut thriller that you won't want to put down.  Matthew Spencer, former POW during Vietnam, and his wife, Alex, have finally made the time to take off into the sunset aboard their sailboat.  Setting sail towards the Bahamian Cays, they are unaware that drugs have been planted in their boat, due to an unfortunate mix-up.  Raoul Chavez, the head of the Colombian drug cartel, wants his drugs and he is willing to go to great lengths to attain them.  In hopes of getting Matt to cooperate and hand over the drugs, Alex is kidnapped and at the mercy of Raoul and his band of criminals.  Matt, tired of waiting for contact, hunts down Raouls' lair and attempts a daring rescue, but is he the hunter or the hunted? A DEADLY EXCHANGE is extremely well written with very little extraneous scenes or dialogue.  The flow of the story was very smooth and the plot was nicely timed and thought out.  A major plus for the book is that the main characters are "real" people, a normal married couple.  Believing the characters to be real, through their actions and thoughts, is always a sure sign that a book has a great chance to catch and keep a reader interested, regardless of what the storyline is.  It just happens that A DEADLY EXCHANGE offers an exciting storyline in addition to the believable characters and wonderful writing.  The chapters are small, mostly three to six pages, which I thought would be a bit annoying, but I was actually grateful since it gave me an extra moment to take in what I had just read.  If there was one thing missing from the story, I'd say that it was the epilogue.  I really would have liked to have a clear-cut ending, but that's just my personal preference, and it in no way detracts from the overall appeal of this book.  A definite must read!
