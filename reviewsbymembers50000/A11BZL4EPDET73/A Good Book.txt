 Nikki James is a private investigator hired to find a missing teenager.  She finds the girl, and with her an evil force that threatens to overtake her mind, sanity, free will and make her a slave to an evil master.  Will Nikki have the strength to battle her private, inner demons and still have the power to defeat the one that's breathing down her neck? Michael Kelly is a vampire who is on the hunt for one of his own kind.  Michael plans on using Nikki and her psychic powers as bait to lure the evil vampire to his death, instead he soon finds himself trying to protect and comfort her.  He's already damned to eternal life; losing Nikki will damn him to eternal hell. Ms. Arthur creates well-drawn out characters.  Nikki is a strong and independent heroine who refuses to be told what to do.  She struggles with the choices she's making, and the choices she's made in the past.  She's afraid to care too much, afraid to love. DANCE WITH THE DEVIL is a fast paced suspense, where a touch of romance, loads of psychic abilities, a few vampires and zombies will have the paranormal reader sitting up and asking for more.  Isn't it nice that the author has already started HEARTS IN DARKNESS (12/01), which is the sequel to this book?  <G>
