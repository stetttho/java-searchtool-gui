 Rheada Samuels has started a new life in Aztec, New Mexico.  Her tour guide business is starting to thrive due to her knowledge of the land she loves and her gifted storytelling.  Rheada is trying to put the past behind her, a past where she was Raven--a legendary and mysterious thief who found and sold Anasazi artifacts.  In walks a man who lives in shadows, a man who is tormented by his own past, Kee Blackburn.  Kee is searching for the legendary Raven.  His sister died chasing rumors of the mysterious thief, and he will have his revenge--no matter what the cost.  Rheada is a strong, independent and courageous woman--my favorite type of heroine.  Kee was a bit too tortured for me at first.  I kept thinking about how he could benefit from anger management courses, but then I tried to put myself into his shoes:  How would I feel if my sister was seduced by the legend of Raven, took off to find her and then lost her life?  I thought that I'd be pretty angry too.  It helped that around the time I was having these thoughts, Kee started to soften towards Rheada, letting some of that constant anger slip away every now and then. I think that Ms. Baker shaped Rheada Samuels after herself, a woman who is a gifted storyteller, who loves and respects Anasazi legends and the Southwestern lands.  RAVEN is a book about legends, revenge, courage, love and redemption.  Ms. Baker has weaved a wonderful story mixing ancient Anasazi legends with a contemporary romantic suspense, adding some paranormal elements just made the book, in my estimation, complete.
