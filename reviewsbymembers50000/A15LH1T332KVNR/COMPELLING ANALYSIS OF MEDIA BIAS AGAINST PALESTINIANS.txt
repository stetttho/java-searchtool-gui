 A RIGOROUS AND WELL DOCUMENTED ANALYSIS BY THIS BRAVE ACADEMIC OF THE CONSTANT AND BLATANT OMISSIONS AND DISTORTION OF REALITY BY THE SO CALLED MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND TV IN PARTICULAR WHEN REPORTING ON THE ONGOING BLOODY CONFLICT IN THE HOLY LANDS WHEREBY TO HIDE THE MISCONDUCT OF ISRAEL AND ITS CONTEMPT FOR  JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW , THE STRATEGY IS IF YOU CAN'T CONVINCE VIEWERS CONFUSE THEM.  AS A RESULT OF SUCH PRO-ISRAEL BIASED COVERAGE OF THE CONFLICT ONLY  A MINORITY OF VIEWERS REGRETFULLY KNOW THAT ISRAEL IS ILLEGALLY AND BRUTALLY OCCUPYING AND EXPLOITING THE WEST BANK AND GAZA  WHERE THE NON JEWISH PALESTINIAN POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN SUFFERING AT THE HANDS OF THE ISRAELI ARMY OUTRAGEOUS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES OF ALL KINDS, INCLUDING ASSASSINATIONS OF THEIR POLITICAL LEADERS, SYSTEMATIC DESTRUCTION OF THEIR CIVILIAN INFRASTRUCTURE, DEMOLITION OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES AND MOST RECENTLY AN APARTHEID WALL WHICH IS TURNING THEIR LIVES INTO MORE HELL AND DESPAIR ETC...  THIS IS IS A MUST READING FOR ANYONE WHO BELIEVES IN PEACE AND JUSTICE AND WANTS TO KNOW THE TRUTH OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE HOLY LANDS WHICH IS OFTEN AT VARIANCE WITH WHAT THE PRO ISRAEL MEDIA REPORTS.
