 In addition to the variety of interesting issues the book covers, I particularly appreciated the comments on the agony of Lebanon as a result of Israel's ferocious and devastating invasion of this peaceful and beautiful country in 1982, which resulted in the killing of more than 18000 people in less than 6 months, most of them civilians. There is also a brave and well founded indictment of the US Government cover up of Israel's deliberate attack against the SS Liberty which caused so many innocent American victims many of whom or their surviving relatives are still crying for justice 35 years after what happened to them or to their dear ones.
