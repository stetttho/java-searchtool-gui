 This is one of the most disturbing and compelling indictments of Israel's apartheid policies and terror tactics (supported by the US Government) not only against its captive overpowered palestinian victims in the occupied teritories but also against Lebanon its peaceful and once prosperous neighbour to the north. Thoroughly documented with evidence and facts particularly about Israel's 1982 invasion and military occupation of Lebanon which caused the death of more than 20000 people mostly civilians and which lasted for 18 years. Most of Chomsky's sources are authoritative and honest israeli and american government, military and media representatives.  Noam Chomsky is a brave and honourable jewish/american academic, in the best tradition of the jewish people,  who believes in human rights and has the courage to say the hidden  historical truth as it is,  contrary to its constant travesty witnessed on a daily basis in the western mainstream media.   Regretfully, most of this media is now owned/controlled by a few conglomerates and dominated/manipulated by the pro-israel, pro-war lobbies who will go to any length to distort history and facts hollywood style in favor of Israel's version of events, i.e transforming the victim into the aggressor and vice versa!  A must reading for anyone interested in learning the true story of what has been happening in the Holy Lands and why .
