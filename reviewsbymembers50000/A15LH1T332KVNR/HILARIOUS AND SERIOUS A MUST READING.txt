 STUPID WHITE MEN is a must reading for anyone who loves the real America and true Americans (but not its corrupt political establishment and greedy corporate elite), in "whose name" the Bush Administration is currently waging a so called "War against terror" which in reality is a war of plunder and theft against 90% of Americans and the have nots of this world whether oil grabbing in Iraq,land grabbing in Palestine, or exploitation of natural resources and cheap labour in Eastern Europe, South America or elsewhere. STUPID WHITE MEN  is hilarious beyond belief, honest, well documented, easy and enjoyable to read and addresses many of the fundamental domestic and foreign policy issues confronting the American Public, who is systematically confused and misled by a greedy and self serving Political Establishment and Corporate Media who work for the 10% of richest Americans and whose motto is: IF YOU CAN'T CONVINCE THEM, CONFUSE THEM THROUGH RELENTLESS LIES, DECEIT AND DISTORTION OF REALITY, Hollywood style....
