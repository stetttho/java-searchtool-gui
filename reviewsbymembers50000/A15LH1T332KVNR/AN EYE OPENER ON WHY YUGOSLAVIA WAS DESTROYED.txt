 A thoroughly researched book on how Europe allowed itself to be dragged by a deceitful Clinton Administration with UK/Nato support into approving/participating in the destruction of Yugoslavia once a european socialist model of a peaceful and happy multicultural/multireligious society.   The consequences of this aggressive and criminal war which devastated the civilian infrastructure of the country and caused the death of hundreds of thousands of people are ethnic tensions that hardly existed before and the continued dislocation and misery of millions of Serbs, Croats and Moslems who have lost their homes, their belongings and any hope for a better future.
