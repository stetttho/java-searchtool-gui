 Ralph Nader's life and activity have been devoted to fighting for the underdog in America against a greedy corporate elite and an increasingly  corrupt deceitful political establishment in its service that does no longer represent the best interests of the citizenry whether with regard to the environment, guaranteed health care, education, equal rights before the law, fair pay, pension protection etc.. Ralph is a talented, decent and highly inspiring American public figure who deserves to be entrusted with the power to serve the legitimate interests of the majority of the American people.
