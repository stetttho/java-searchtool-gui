 Webster Tarpley's authoritative book is compelling reading for those who do not believe the fictitious and suspect official version of what happened on 9/11 particularly the non existent Boeing 757 at the Pentagon, , the Towers and Building #7  falling perfectly in controlled demolition mode, Norad War Games on that Day of Infamy,  the removal of the rubble (key criminal evidence) to unknown destinations etc..  The number of these skeptics continues to increase abroad and at home thanks to the relentless efforts of Thierry Meyssan, Eric Hufschmid, James Walter, Scholars for 911 truth, David Ray Griffin, and the families of many of the victims who refuse to be bribed into silence by financial indemnification offers   etc..  Momentum to find out the truth is building up on the Internet and through books like this one ,in spite of the complicity of the mainstream media which continues to protect the Bush Administration from any direct questioning on the issue whilst keeping a lid on renewed and widening attempts to investigate the lies, omissions and contradictions highlighted by the above campaigners with regard to White House Statements, evasive answers and delaying tactics against the creation of the 911 Commission and eventually the pro-official version script imposed on the investigation etc..  Synthetic Terror is a must and painful reading for any American who loves his country.
