 I could not agree more with the eloquent comments printed on this page by B.J. Russell, London under the title "Facts & Distortions" supporting with additional testimony and documentation the findings and conclusions of Michael Hoffman II and Moshe Lieberman.  The authors of this splendid book should be commended for their honourable contribution to the true history of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, i.e. between a ruthless racist Occupier and its victims under an oppressive and genocidal occupation made possible by the constant tacit support and protection of successive US Administrations since 1948. Under Bush, Washington's support for Israel's criminal policies in contempt of the rule of law and the Geneva conventions has become more blatant than ever!
