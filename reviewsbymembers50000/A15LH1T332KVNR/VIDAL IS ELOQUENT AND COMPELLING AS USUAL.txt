 Gore's reflections are a pleasure to read : he is compelling  in his rigorous condemnation of what is wrong in America and its fraudulent  political/economic  system which produces too many multimillionaire felons or outright criminals most of whom evade either detection or punishment when not ending up in high office.   It is a system capable of initiating country devastating wars based on lies, supporting Israel's genocidal war under the cover of the "War on Terror"  in addition to producing millions of jobless Americans, without pensions or savings and last but not least the recent shameful  disaster of New Orleans .   At the same time Gore Vidal is a distinguished representative of a beautiful and principled America  made of many millions of decent and educated citizens , the increasingly less silent majority, who no longer take part in a hopelessly corrupt democracy where money is king,morality an optional and the public interest is the victim of powerful private ones!
