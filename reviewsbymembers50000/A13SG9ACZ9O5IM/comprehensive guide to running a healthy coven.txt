 This book is an unbeatable resource for Wiccan covens and similarly structured groups. There is some basic background on Paganism, then chapter after chapter about every conceivable aspect of finding, creating, or sustaining a healthy coven: finding people, deciding on coven activities and scheduling them, coven leadership structures, different systems of initiation, coven offices, group dynamics, activities, community relations, legal and financial matters, counseling, and more. There are multiple options for just about everything, so you can use this book regardless of the kind of coven you would prefer to develop and work with. There are sample rituals, advertisements, flyers, articles of incorporation, and liturgy. The author has decades of experience in forming and maintaining healthy covens that last more than the 2-3 years that is the national average these days. The whole thing is written in a down-to-earth style peppered with humor and fun. It really demystifies the coven and gets down to business about how good ones actually work. Whether you are seeking to establish a new coven or energize/stabilize an existing one, you'll be coming back to this book frequently for its thorough and varied treatments of virtually everything you need to give thought to. This is one you'll use.
