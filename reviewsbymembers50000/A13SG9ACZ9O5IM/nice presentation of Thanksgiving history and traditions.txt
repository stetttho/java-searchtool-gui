 This book covers the history of Thanksgiving and a wide range of Thanksgiving traditions: not just the turkey, but the parades, football games, etc. It has a strong international scope, going beyond the US holiday to discuss celebrations in Africa, Europe, and elswhere. There are two projects at the end: a cute turkey made from a pinecone, and a cranberry/sour cream gelatin dish to make. The book reads a lot like a school textbook at about the fourth or fifth grade level. Although recommended for ages 9-12, I got it to read to my 5-year-old, and she's enjoyed it. There are enough pictures to hold her attention, and an adult can easily adapt or expand on the text to make it easier for a younger child to understand. This book is a fine tool for teaching children of all ages (and adults!) about Thanksgiving as celebrated in the US and around the world.
