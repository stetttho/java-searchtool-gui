 Brian Williams returned to the historical roots of the tarot in the Italian renaissance to find inspiration for this deck. The feel of the deck is very warm, bright, and sensual. The deck conveys the renaissance spirit  of optimism about humanity: mind, body, and spirit are drawn together and  glorified. The minor arcana are illustrated with small vignettes from  classical mythology, and the court cards are connected with four major  cities of the Italian Renaissance. The book that comes with the deck is a  tour-de-force study of renaissance symbolism in art and literature, as it  applies to the tarot. Williams relates the tarot trumps to mythology,  Christianity, alchemy, astrology and the other cultural influences of the  time. Not just a guide to this particular deck, it is an important resource  for all serious tarot students. Although this deck differs in many ways  from most contemporary decks (which are based on the Anglo-French tradition  rather than the Italian), it still manages to be comfortable and easy to  learn for those already familiar with other decks. I recommend this set  wholeheartedly for beginners and experienced tarot users alike.
