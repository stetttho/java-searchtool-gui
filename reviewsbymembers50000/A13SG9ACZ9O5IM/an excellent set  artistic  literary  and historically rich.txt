 Brian Williams returned to the historical roots of the tarot in renaissance Italy for his inspiration in designing this deck. The feel of the deck is warm, bright, and sensual. The delicately rendered figures of  the major arcana are depicted against the backdrop of the Italian  countryside. The minor arcana are illustrated with small vignettes drawn  from classical mythology, and the court cards are associated with four  major cities of the Italian renaissance. The book accompanying the deck  is a tour-de-force study of renaissance symbolism in art and literature as  it applies to the tarot. The major arcana are related to mythology,  Christianity, alchemy, astrology, and other cultural influences of the  time. Much more than just a guide to this particular deck, the book is an  essential resource for any serious student of the tarot. Although the  deck includes many variations from the more commonly encountered tarot  imagery (being based on the Italian tradition rather than, like most decks,  the Anglo-French traditon), it still manages to be very comfortable and  easy to learn for those already familiar with other decks. A superb set,  highly recommended for beginner and experienced tarot user alike. There are  few better ways to spend $30 on tarot.
