 I waited a long time for this book. After reading "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" several years ago, I eagerly awaiting Morris' continuation of TR's story. Unfortunately, Morris got caught up in writing "Dutch", the misbegotten biography of Ronald Reagan , and didn't finish this book for some time. However, it was worth the wait. Morris picks up where he left off, following TR through his presidency. Once again, this meticulously reasearched  book brings TR magically to life. I definitely recommend reading the first book before tackling this one to get a full flavor of the man and his accompishments. Excellent book. Highly recommended.
