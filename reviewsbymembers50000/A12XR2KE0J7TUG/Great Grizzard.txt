 I grew up reading Lewis Grizzard's column in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and have loved him for years. Not only was he the best Southern humorist of his generation, he was a truly gifted writer. I have an autographed copy of this book and have read it many times. It is laugh-out-loud funny but you don't have to be from Georgiaor the South to appreciate Grizzard's humor. The humor is "southern" but the the characters and situations are universal. Great book.
