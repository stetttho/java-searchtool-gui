 If you read this absolutely superb book, please be aware that you will never be able to look at any animal, either those normally labelled as "farm" animals such as chickens, pigs or cows, or those considered to be domesticated,such as dogs or cats,quite the same way ever again. This is, in effect, at least for me, a life-altering book. I made a commitment to vegetarianism after reading just a few chapters of this powerful, persuasive book. Yes, much of it is anecdotal but I defy anyone with any knowledge of animal behavior to deny Masson's central premise - that all animals are capable of thought, feeling and emotion and should be treated with as much respect and dignity that we accord (or at least should accord) to our fellow human beings. Even if this book does not persuade everyone toward a vegetarian lifestyle, I hope that anyone who reads this important book comes away with a better understanding of how the food we mindlessly eat actually reaches our tables. Not everyone will be persuaded by Masson's evidence but there is no denying the absolute misery endured by so many of God's creatures. A powerful, important book. Highly recommended
