 Instead of getting better with age,this series seems to be stuck in a rut.The early entries in the series (The  Body in the Transept, To Perish in Penzance) were so much better than the most recent Dorothy Martin mysteries. Dorothy seems a bit sanctimonious these days and the presence of her dull husband, Alan Nesbitt, doesn't help much. Nesbitt is so sketchily drawn that it's hard to see him as anything other than just a shoulder for Dorothy to cry on once in a while. The plot in this book is only mildly involving and the mystery not very difficult to figure out. Overall, this is an ok book but it difinitely could have been better.
