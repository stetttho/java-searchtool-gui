 I almost never like a movie better than the original book but it was definitely the case with this novel. I think I would have liked the book better if I had read it before seeing the movie. Oh, well... In any case, it took a lot of effort to understand the working class Scots dialect and I almost gave up on several occasions. The book is worth the effort, however, and overall I was pleased with it but I just can't give it more than 3 stars.
