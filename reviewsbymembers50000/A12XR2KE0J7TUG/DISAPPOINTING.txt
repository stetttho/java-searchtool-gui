 There are so many flaws with Red Zone but the most glaring,the most disappointing is that the focus of the book is not on the victim,Diane Whipple, but on some sleazy con named Paul Schneider. The book starts off well but quickly deteriorates. We only get the briefest glimpse into the life of Whipple but we get treated to endless irrelevant details about Schneider and his girlfriends. Who cares? I found myself skimming through many pages toward the middle of the book.hoping the book would regain the promise of the early pages. Not so.  This subject would have been done justice by someone with the talent of a more polished writer, such as Ann Rule. I can't really recommend this book but if you must read it, save your money and get it at the library.
