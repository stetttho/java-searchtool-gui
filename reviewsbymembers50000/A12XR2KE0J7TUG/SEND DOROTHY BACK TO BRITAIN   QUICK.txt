 Killing Cassidy takes place in the author's home state of Indiana rather than the village of Sherebury in England and the results are somewhat disappointing. Dorothy seems out of sorts during the entire book and is rather whiny. The characters lose much of their charm in the move across the Atlantic. The plot was ok but I enjoyed the other books in the series a lot more. Let's hope Dorothy hightails it back to England and stays there.
