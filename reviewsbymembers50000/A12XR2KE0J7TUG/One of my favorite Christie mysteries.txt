 Murder in Mesopotamia may not be as famous as some of Agatha Christie's other works but it is an excellent book none the less. Featuring Hercule Poirot, the story is set in Mesopotamia (i.e. Iraq) at an archaeological dig. Christie's husband, Max Mallowan, was a noted British archaeologist and she spent a great deal of time with him in Iraq. Her familiarity with and affection for her subject matter is clear and infuses the story. The book itself is classic Christie- well-plotted, crisp dialogue, great characters, lots of red herrings and a satisfying conclusion which, as usual, left me stumped. Great fun to read. Highly recommended.
