 The pictures of this toy don't begin to do it justice in terms of how darn cute this toy is! It is just so adorable. The suggested age is 18 months and up but I think it's also great for babies 8 months and up. The bowling "pins" are soft, cuddly farm animals that your child will love to hug and snuggle with.The bowling "ball" is a soft, fuzzy stuffed ball that can be squeezed and batted around without doing any damage whatsoever. I can't imagine any child not being absolutely entranced by this lovely toy.
