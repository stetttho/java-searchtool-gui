 I've had Black and Decker ovens for years and,unlike many other reviewers, have been very pleased with the quality and reliability of B&D. I was all set to buy another one when I saw this cool looking oven.It defintely has a "retro" look with a lot of chrome. I'll admit I bought it because of the looks. I've had it for about a month now and so far, so good. It's easy to operate and easy to clean. The only thing that is taking some getting used to is having to pull out the toaster rack/tray manually when I open the oven. On all my Black & Decker ovens, the tray was connected to the door by hinges, so when you opened the door the tray pulled out. Not a big deal,but worth mentioning to anyone used to B& D. The outside of the oven gets blistering hot too if it's on for longer than a toast cycle. If you have kids, caution them to stay away or they'll get burned. Overall, it seems to be a good product and hopefully it will be as reliable as my other Cuisinart products.
