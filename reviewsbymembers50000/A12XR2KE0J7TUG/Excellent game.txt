 My son has played and enjoyed the pc versions of Backyard Baseball for a couple of years. He also plays the All-Star Baseball series, MLB Slugfest and most of the other baseball games around but he still keeps coming back to this old favorite. Updated for Gamecube,the graphics are outstanding and the gameplay is really fun and entertaining .I think children really enjoy seeing their MLB heroes like Derek Jeter, Chipper Jones, Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa etc. as kids and can really identify with them. This game is best for kids 5-9 but older children (up to maybe 11) will enjoy it also but probably not as much as younger kids. An outstanding game, highly recommended
