 I love Stephen Ambrose and despite the recent controversy, I consider him to be one of the best American historians ever. This is my favorite of all his books and if you're looking for the definitive account of Lewis and Clark's expedition, this is it. Masterfully written, it is hard to put down. I've read it 4 times already and it never fails to impress. Truly excellent, highly recommended.
