 Miss Jane Marple is in London on holiday and is staying at posh Bertram's hotel. Where Miss Marple goes, murder is sure to follow and it does. The details of Bertram's Hotel- the service, the high tea, etc- are great touches from a bygone era and help to make this book memorable. The plot is well-constructed and well-written although there are a few signs of the decline in Christie's work that was to begin a few years later.Overall,this is an enjoyable mystery by the greatest mystery writer ever.
