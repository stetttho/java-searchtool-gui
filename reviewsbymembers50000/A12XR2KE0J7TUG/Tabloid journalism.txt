 Just the idea of writing a book about the so-called "Kennedy curse" is pretty ludicrous...what serious-minded person is actually going to believe the idea of a modern family being afflicated with a "curse"? The whole premise of the book is preposterous and pretty laughable. This book really doesn't rise above the level of tabloid journalism and is full of innuendo and gossip. Whatever one thinks of the Kennedys as individuals or a whole, this book is pretty sad.
