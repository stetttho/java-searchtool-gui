 Postern of Fate, published in 1973, was the last book ever written by the incomparable Agatha Christie. My vote for her worst book ever was Passenger to Frankfurt.Christie's health was in sharp decline when writing Postern of Fate  and unfortunately it shows. The plot involves Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, now in their retirement, investigating a murder in retrospect. The story is very unfocused and many elements of the story just don't make sense. Considering all the great books she wrote over her career and the countless hours of pleasure she provided to readers all over the world for several generations, Christie can certainly be forgiven  for a few clunkers later in the life. I's actually give her two stars for execution, three stars for effort
