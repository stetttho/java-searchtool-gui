 Lennon Legend by James Henke is a must for any fan of John Lennon and the Beatles. So much that has been written about Lennon since his tragic death has been sad and rather downbeat. You won't find that here.Created with the cooperation of Yoko Ono, this is a jotous celebration of Lennon's life in his own words and in pictures, many of which have not been seen before. This is like a stroll though a Lennon musueum, with handwritten song lyrics, notes from his wife and family photos. The audio CD is fascinating, with Lennon reminiscing about his life from his school days to the breakup of the Beatles. This is all great fun and a fantastic, worthy addition to all fan's collection. Highly recommended.
