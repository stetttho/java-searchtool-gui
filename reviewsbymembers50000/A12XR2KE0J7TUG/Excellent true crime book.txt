 Extremely Well-written ans meticulously researched, Death Sentence tells the story of convicted murderer Velma Barfield who was executed by lethal injection in North Carolina in the late 1980's. Reading this book, I knew Velma was guilty, knew that she was a cold-blooded killer who murdered for financial gain and...yet...I found it really, really difficult not to feel some compassion for her as she neared the end of her life on death row. This book didn't change my mind about the death penalty but I came away from reading it with the uneasy conviction that Velma Barfield was sincerely remorseful about her crimes (as well she should) and was a changed woman.I don't think her death row religous awakening was phony. I could be wrong.I found it easy to intensely dislike the early Velma but not the elderly Velma. Anyway, unlike so many true crime books, Death Sentence makes you think about much larger issues.
