 Indian Summer tells the forgotten story of Louis Sockalexis, the pioneer Native American baseball player who briefly captured the American public's imagination in the 1890's. Sockalexis has been previously relegated to a footnote in baseball history (if he was mentioned at all) but he was so gifted as a ballplayer and might have had a truly great career if not for his tragic losing battle with alcoholism. The book is well-written and presents a fascinating picture of the early days of professional baseball and an American society which was not quite ready to embrace a Native American hero so soon after Custer and Little Big Horn. Life after baseball was not kind to Sockalexis and his death is quite sad. This is not a "feel good" book but anyone interested in American history should defintely not miss it.Highly recommended
