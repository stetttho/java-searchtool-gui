 I had heard Warren Eckstein often on the radio and have seen himon the Today Show so I was anxious to see if this book was as good as his media appearances. It is,and then some.For all of us who share our lives with our feline companions,this book is an entertaining and invaluable tool to help us understand our cats better and make living with them easier and more enjoyable for all parties. Sure, a lot of the advice Warren gives  seems to be just common sense but sometimes it takes a very smart man to simplify things so you finally say "aha, that's it!". Some of the "problem" situations discussed in the book may have common sense solutions but when you are the one dealing with the problem, you don't always have the insight to recognize and correct the problem by yourself. That is where an expert like Warren Eckstein comes in. Writing in an engaging, straightforward and witty manner, he gives advice that really does work.I'd recommend this book to all cat lovers.
