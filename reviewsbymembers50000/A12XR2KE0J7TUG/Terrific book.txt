 Evil Under the Sun is one of Christie's most enduring mysteries. It features Hercule Poirot and takes place on Smuggler's Island off the coast of Devon. This is classic Christie- drop off all the characters in an isolated setting, kill one of them off and let Poirot  (or Miss Marple) go to work. The plot is well-conceived and executed, the story fast paced and Poirot is, as usual, incomparablewhen using his little gray cells to figure out the identity of the murderer. This is first-rate Christie and should be enjoyed by every mystery fan. Highly recommended.
