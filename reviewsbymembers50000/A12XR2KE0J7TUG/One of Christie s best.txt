 This book ranks right up there with Murder on the Orient Express as one of Agatha Christie's best known books. Because it is so well-written, it is also one of her best-loved mysteries as well and one of her most critically acclaimed. The sharply written plot involves murder on a cruise ship on the Nile and is brimming with exotic locales, crisp dialogue  and wonderful characters. Poirot is at his best in this book. Absolutely first-rate Christie and a perfect example of why she is the greatest mystery writer in history.
