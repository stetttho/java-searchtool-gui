 Fairy tales don't always end happily, as evidenced by the somewhat sad story of Grace Kelly's life post-Hollywood. I enjoyed the parts of this book dealing with Kelly's early life and movie career rather than her life as a princess. What is very clear is that Grace Kelly was no saint but who really wanted her or expected to be anyway? She was a real human being who evidently made a mistake in her choice of husbands. Taraborelli does a pretty decent job of telling her life story although there is a fair amount of gossip,although most of it seems to be factually based. Overall,this is apretty interesting book although it's not going to win a Pulitzer Prize.
