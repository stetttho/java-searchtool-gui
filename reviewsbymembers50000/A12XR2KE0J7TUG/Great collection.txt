 Anyone not familiar with Lewis Grizzard ought to be in for a treat reading these books. I grew up reading Grizzard in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and I remember laughing out loud at the breakfast table so, so many times. Grizzard was a terrifically funny man, southern to the core and wrote basically about what he knew best- life in the south. Grizzard was more than just a funny guy, however, he was a real writer, a true talent. This collection makes me realize how much I miss him. You don't have to be southern to appreciate Grizzard, however, no more than you'd have to be from the Midwest to like Garrison  Keillor. This is Grizzard at his best.
