 David Halberstam has written an engrossing and touching tribute to not just the FDNY but to firefighters everywhere. He does a masterful job of bringing us inside the firehouse and showing what life is like for the men and women who put their lives on the line every day. This is classic Halberstam and a very satisfying read. I wish it had been a little longer but it's still a superb book.
