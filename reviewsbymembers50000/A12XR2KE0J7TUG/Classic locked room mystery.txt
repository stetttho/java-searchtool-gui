 Cards on the Table is classic Agatha Christie and one of her most memorable efforts. The victim, Mr.Shaitana ,is murdered during a game of bridge and all suspects are known at the outset.This is , in effect, a "locked room" mystery and it is up to Hercule Poirot to unmask the murderer. Christie keeps you guessing about the identity of the murderer until the very end. Each suspect in turn appears both innocent and guilty and there are many, many twists and surprises to keep you on your toes. Excellently plotted and masterfully written, this is a superb mystery. Highly recommended
