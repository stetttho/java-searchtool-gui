 Abraham Joshua Heschel has written a great biography of Maimonides which, although it may not be to everyone's taste, is still very satisfying and rewarding  This is obviously not a book for the masses and it certainly would help to know a little bit about Maimonides before picking up this book. A superb book. Highly recommended
