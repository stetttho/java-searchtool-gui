 No, this song is not the style or type of music that most people typically expect from Jewel but, give her a break, this is definitely not in the same category as Britney Spears. The main difference is that Jewel has what Britney does not:  genuine TALENT ! Yes, this single and upcoming CD represent a different direction for this multi-talented singer/songwriter/actress/poet but the bottom line is that Jewel still makes good music. Give her credit for spreading her wings a little and trying something a little different. Intuition is an infectious, catchy tune and I am really looking forward to hearing the entire CD.
