 Mention the name Peter Allen to a crowd of people and you are likely to be met with a blank stare or a "who?". If the name sounds remotely familiar to some, it's usually because he is remembered as Liza Minnelli's first husband or the guy that was on the old Merv Griffin show a lot. What a shame. Allen was a truly great performer and one of the best songwriters around prior to his untimely death. Listen to "I Go to Rio" or "The More I See you" and try not to feel the infectious energy of this man. This is a great collection of songs. The only quibble I have is that my favorite Allen song "Harbour" is not on this CD. In an agewhere the word "superstar" is so overused and where talent is so fleeting, Allen truly deserves the title "master".
