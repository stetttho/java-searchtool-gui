 This book is the autobiographical story of Hannah Crafts, a slave who, with her female owner, fled from her plantation in North Carolina. What is amazing is that this book is apparently the first novel written by an African-American female and was only recently dicovered.It took me a while to get used to the author's narrative style but it was well worth the effort. The introduction by Henry Louis Gates Jr. is also excellent and helps to better understand the historical context of this important book. Highly recommended.
