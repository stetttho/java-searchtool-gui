 A great album from an underappreciated singer-songwriter who unfortunately is still more well-known for being  Liza Minnelli's first husband. Allen was the consummate showman and a superb songwriter. Hearing him live is hearing him at his very best. He was one of those performers who thrived before a live audience and reveal so much more of themselves than on a recording. All of his best songs are here, including the sublime "Harbour". What a talent!
