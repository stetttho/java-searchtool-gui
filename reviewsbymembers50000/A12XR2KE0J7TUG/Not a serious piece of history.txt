 If this book were written solely as an account of the love story between Queen Noor and King Hussein, I could it probably have stomached it better. There are some charming anecdotes here about Queen Noor's private family life with the King and their children. Pity she didn't stop there.However, the former Lisa Halaby seems to think of herself as an expert on the Middle East by virtue of her heritage and the fact that she married a Middle Eastern monarch. Her views of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict are so simplistic and one-sided as to be laughable. When she calls the dounding of the state of Israel a "catastrophe" for the Arab people, you have no doubt whose side she is one. She glosses over a lot of the unsavory details about her husband's reign and those of his political allies and makes incredibly naive comments about many of the significant issues facing the region today. It's not hard to understand why since the Queen still lives in Jordan part-time and aspires for her son to be on the throne one day. Can't do anything which would upset the folks back home.This memoir is very self-serving,inaccurate  and dishonest.
