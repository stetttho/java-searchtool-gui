 I am not a big basketball fan and knew nothing about the subject of this book before picking it up. However, I was quickly drawn into the book by Feinstein's crisp, clear, exciting account of e moment in sports history that changed the way a sport is played. The effect of the "punch" on the lives of the players involved was fascinating and very sad. Well-written and highly recommended.
