 I am a huge fan of Agatha Christie and have read everything she's every written (including her Mary Wwestmacott novels) several times. This is one of her best, with a great plot and great atmosphere on Indian island. Several movies have been made based on this particular book but none has come even remotely close to capturing the excitement of this book. This one keeps you guessing until the very end and the solution to the mystery is very satisfying
