 Finally, a book about the great Ted Williams that does not focus on his shortcomings. Too much has been written about Williams' sometimes surly behavior and it's about time that someone,like the the giften Richard ben Cramer, got past all that to give a illuminating portrait of Ted the athlete and the an. Great book for all baseball and sports fans. Highly recommended
