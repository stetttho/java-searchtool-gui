 Kate Remembered is not a biography of Katharine Hepburn per se but is more of a remembrance and tribute by a writer who knew her well during her last 20 years and frankly admits adoring her. Scott Berg is not really objective about Hepburn but, again, this is not a true biography. What we get here is a portrait of the real Hepburn, with all her energy,intelligence , wit and zest for life coming through on every page.Another review noted that Hepburn comes across as a "phony" but that is definitely the one thing she never was. She was always true to herself and remains a enduring classic , an American icon. This is a must for any Hepburn fan and a great book for any film buff. Warmly written, this is Berg's love letter to a woman he admired for years and came to love as a friend. An excellent book.
