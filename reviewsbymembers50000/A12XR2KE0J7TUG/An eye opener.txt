 I really expected not to like this book based on some of the reviews here. I expected the cadets featured in Lipsky's book to be little robot , mindlessly following orders, playing at being soldiers. Boy, was I wrong ! What emerges here are compelling portraits of men and women who,for various reasons, sought to compete for a place at highly elite (but not elitist) West Point, and , ultimately ,to serve their country. These cadets are real individuals, with strengths and flaws, positives and negatives.We meet a couple of brats and whiners in the pages of this book but also many outstanding individuals who give me reason to hope in the future of our country. What I didn't realize before reading this fine book is that West Point has become a true microcosm of American society, a place where even the most disadvantaged person can succeed on what is truly a level playing field. West Point is a true meritocracy. This is really an excellent book and would be enjoyed by even those, like myself, who are not really big military buffs.
