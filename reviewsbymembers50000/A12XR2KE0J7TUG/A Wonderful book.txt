 The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio is an absolute gem of a book. Terry Ryan has written a lovely and loving tribute to her inspirational and inventive mother, Evelyn Ryan,who managed to keep her family out of poverty's reach because of her uncanny knack for winning contests. The book is in turn funny and poignant and stays with you long,long  after the final page has been read. Beautifully written, this book is just plain wonderful. Highly recommended. It would make a lovely Mother's Day gift.
