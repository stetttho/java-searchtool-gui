 Another very enjoyable entry in the Agatha Raisin series by M.C. Beaton. Since James Lacey has deserted Agatha for a monastic life in France and Sir Charles Fraith has gotten married,Agatha is free to get on with her life and become as independent as she was before. I was growing a bit weary of Agatha constantly mooning over James and am glad he's out of the picture.The introduction of new neighbor (and possible love interest) John Armitage is possibly a good development if Beaton can avoid making him into the second coming of James Lacey. The book hints at Agatha becoming a professional detective in coming installments and it will be interesting to see how this turns out. If you like Agatha, you will love this book.
