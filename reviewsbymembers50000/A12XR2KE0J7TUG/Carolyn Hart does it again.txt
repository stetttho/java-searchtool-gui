 Carolyn Hart has been my favorite American mystery writer for years and Engaged to Die is another example why. Other reviewers have already described the plot so there's no need to regurgitate the same info here. Carolyn Hart is the best American mystery writer around today. Period. The main characters , Annie and Max Darling, are terrifically engaging,the setting of Broward's Rock is a perfect setting for a mystery (although the murder rate on this little island is alarmingly high!) and the writing is crisp and fresh even though the Death on Demand series has been around for about ten years now. The characters are so real and believable that I keep getting the urge to drive up to South Carolina and drop in to Death on Demand and grab a cup of coffee with Annie or get a bowl of chili at Parotti's.  This is definitely not a hard-boiled series and if you are a fan of the cozy mystery genre, I have no doubt you will enjoy this book.I cannot wait for the next one. ...
