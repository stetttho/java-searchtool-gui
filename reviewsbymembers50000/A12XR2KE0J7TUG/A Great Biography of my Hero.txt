 Sandy Koufax is one of the greatest players ever and my personal favorite pitcher. This engrossing book does justice to the legacy of this complicated man and sports icon. Leavy cautions, thankfully, in the introduction that she is not going to dish up any dirt on Sandy and she keeps her promise. The book focuses purely on baseball and Koufax's mighty legacy. And that's just perfect. Koufax is still somewhat of a mystery and in an age where we know too much about our heroes, I'd like to keep it that way. Sandy endures and this book will too. Highly recommended.
