 A Body to Die For is the second entry in what hopefully will be Kate White's long series of mystery novels featuring the likable, sharp-witted writer Bailey Weggins. Though not as good as If Looks Could Kill,the first book featuring Bailey, the plot revolving around a death of a masseuse at a Bed & Brekfast/day spa hums along nicely ,with a lot of interesting characters and intriguing sub-plots. This is a fairly quick read and it can easily be finished in a day or two.It's a fun, enjoyable book.Not great literature obviously but still a guilty pleasure.
