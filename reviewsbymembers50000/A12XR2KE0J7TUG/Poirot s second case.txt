 Hercule Poirot and Captain Hhastings are in France when they are called on to investigate a murder on a golf course. The story is not really centered on golf so don't let that put you off if you're not a fan of the sport. Poirot, of course, solves the mystery in his inimitable way. The polt is pretty well constructed and the solution to the crime is not too obvious. This is a pretty good Christie book but not up there with her best.
