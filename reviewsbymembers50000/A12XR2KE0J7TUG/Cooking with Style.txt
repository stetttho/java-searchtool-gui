 I think that this latest Barefoot Contessa cookbook has kept up with the quality of Ina Garten's previous books. This is cooking with simple and elegant style. The recipes are fun and not too difficult for the average cook. Ina looks like she's having so much fun in the kitchen that it's hard not to join in her enthusiasm for cooking and entertaining.
