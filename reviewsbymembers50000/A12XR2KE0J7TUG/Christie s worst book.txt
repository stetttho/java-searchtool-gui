 I have adored Agatha Christie for many years and have read everything she's every written at least several times. This is the only Christie book that I can ever remember hating while I was reading it. It pains me to say this but this is definitely her worst book ever, hands down. Even Postern of Fate and Elephants Can Remember had some redeeming qualities but not this book. I should probably give it one star but I just cannot bring myself to do that to Agatha. Part of the problem with this book is that Christie evidently got herself caught up in the late 1960's spy/conspiracy craze and got carried away by a genre she had no business dealing with. The other problem is that Agatha's writing skills had declined significantly when this book was published and it shows in this book. If there are any readers out there who are not familiar with Christie or who are only casual fans, please do not read this book until you have read every other Christie availabled. I would suggest reading any of her works written prior to 1958 first (preferably reading the 1920's and 30's first)and only then begin reading her later stuff.
