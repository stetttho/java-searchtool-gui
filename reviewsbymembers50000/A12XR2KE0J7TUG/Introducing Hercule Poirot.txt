 The Mysterious Affair at Styles was Agatha Christie's first book and the one that first introduced the world to the inimitable Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. Christie startedwriting this book in 1910 when,during a period of illness, she was so bored that her mother challenged her to write a book. This, more of less , was the result and what a result it was!. The story takes place at Styles Court , a country house in Essex.We are also introduced to Captain Hastings, Poirot's sometimes sidekick, in this book.The Mysterious Affair at Styles is classic Christie - lots of upper-crust suspects, an isolated country house, lots of red herrings, crisp dialogue and superb plotting. This is a great introduction to Christie and definitely one of her best. Highly recommended
