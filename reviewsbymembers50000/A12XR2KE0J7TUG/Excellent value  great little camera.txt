 I bought this as gift for my 12 year old son who was dying for a digital camera. Considering he quickly breaks most electronic equipment he gets his hands on, I figured I couldn't go wrong with thisdigital camera for him to practice with. Guess what? The camera is worth every penny and more.It's easy, fun, very compact and portable.Picture quality is not the same as what you'd get with a more expensivecamera of course but you just can't beat the price and quality of this little gem. All my son's friends now want one of their own. It's a great buy and I highly recommend it.
