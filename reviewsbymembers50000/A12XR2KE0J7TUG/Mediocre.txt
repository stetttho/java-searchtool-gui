 I decided to give this series another shot after I read and disliked one of the author's other books. I hate to pile on but this series really does fall flat. Ruby is an unappealing character and the plot seems farfetched and convoluted.That is the kiss of death in a series that hopes to have any staying power. The supporting characters are very irritating .It would be so great to have a cozy mystery series with a strong Jewish female protagonist but Ruby is not in the running.
