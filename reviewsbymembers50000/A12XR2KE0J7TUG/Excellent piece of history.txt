 The Battle for Rome by Robert Katz is an engrossing, vivid telling of an often overlooked campaign in World War II. Most people tend to think of Rome as being on the sidelines of the European conflict but, as Katz masterfully shows, this is not at all the case. In The Battle of Rome, we see the Allies fighting to overtake the Germans and push them out of the city, the Italian patriots fighting to re-capture Rome from the Nazis and the Pope practically collaborating with the Germans to protect the Vatican at the expense of the Italians. There is so much going on in this book, so much detail and intrigue but Katz holds it all together and keeps the story moving forward at a breathtaking pace.This book is well-researched and masterfully written. Definitely recommended for any WWII buff or anyone who loves top-notch historical scholarship.
