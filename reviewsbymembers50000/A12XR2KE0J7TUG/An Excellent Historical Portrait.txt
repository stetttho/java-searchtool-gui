 Woman of Color, Daughter of Privilege tells the story of Amanda Dickson, daughter of a wealthy plantation owner in rural Georgia and one of his slaves. Amanda was much loved by her father and amazingly went on to inherit most of his estate upon his death despite the strict racial segregation and discrimination of the era. Obviously, this situation was unique for its time. The book is very well-written,very informative and provides a good glimpse into the life of a privileged woman in a strictly segregated society. Highly recommended
