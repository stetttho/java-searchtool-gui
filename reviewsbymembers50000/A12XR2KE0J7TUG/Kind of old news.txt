 The story Corbitt has to tell of rampant corruption and Mafia influence in the Chicago (and vicinity) police force in the 1960's and 1970's is interesting but it's kind of old news by now. His personal involvement as a "law enforcement officer" (if you can call him that with a straight face) is what differentiates this book from others of this type. The problem with this book is that Corbitt seems to have an enormous ego and obviously thinks very highly of himself. He was obviously one very sleazy guy if all he writes is true but who can really believe him? I didn't much care for his style of writing and his story might have been more compelling in the hands of more gifted writers.
