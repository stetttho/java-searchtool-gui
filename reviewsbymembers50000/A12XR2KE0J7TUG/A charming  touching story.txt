 What can you say about a book that details the love story betwen a man and his elephant? One word: FANTASTIC! I came across this book by sheer accident and only picked it up because of the cute cover photo. Intrigued, I bought it and found it hard to put down. The relationship between Bob and his sometimes feisty but lovable elephant, Amy,was just so sweet and touching, not at all cloying or silly the way it could have been in the hands of a less gifted writer. I really, really enjoyed this book. You can read it in a day or two but the emotions the book stirs up will stay with you for a long,long time. Wherever you are, Bob Norris, thank you for taking care of Amyand giving her such a good life.
