 I bought this for my son a few years back and I wish I had a nickle for every time I had to read it to him! He actually could have "read" it himself since it is very simply writeen , the primary word being "yes", "no" and "David". My son was just enchanted by this book and giggled everytime he saw the illustration of David running in the street with no pants on(rear view only!). Even though he's 7 now, he still won't let me get rid of this ook. It's actually suitable for ages 2-5. Yes, David is not a very attractively drawn character with his jagged looking teeth and big head but that's really part of his charm. The story itself is rather simple and lets kids know they are loved no matter what they get into. This is a great book with a great message. Highly recommended.
