 This is a fascinating look inside one Nascar season which will appeal to all sports fans, not just racing fanatics. The season begins with the Daytona 500 and Dale Earnhardt's tragic death and concentrates on the fortunes of the Roush Racing team drivers, namely Mark Martin, Matt Kenseth, Jeff Burton and rookie Kurt Busch.The writing is fast-paced, exciting and I found myself turning the pages to see who won a race even though I already knew the outcome! Reading this book should make anyone who has ever said Nascar drivers are not athletes realize exactly what these guys go through physically and mentally during the course of a race and what it takes to be a champion.An excellent book,highly recommended.
