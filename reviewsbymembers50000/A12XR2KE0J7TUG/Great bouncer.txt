 I bought the Aquarium Bouncer for my niece and it appears to be a big hit!  The bouncer is very sturdy and well-constructed. The safety harness fastens easily and the toy bar can be quickly put on or taken off. The toy bar itself is adorable with little floating fish, bubbles and soothing ocean noises. The motor has a gentle hum which appears to be quite soothing. This seemsto be an excellent product for a great price.
