 Having seen Ms. Coulter's appearances on television talk shows many,many times,I found her to be obviously intelligent and sharp-witted. I also found her to be rather rude, condescending, strident and possessed of opinions that often make her seem rather deranged. Watching her on TV,she seemed to be more performer than a serious political analyst.Maybe, I thought, she saved her more thoughtful and reasoned commentary for the sedate world of publishing rather than the circus atmosphere of talk-show television. How wrong I was. Ms. Coulter is even more disturbing in print that she is on the small screen. On television, she just seems to spit out the most outrageous thing that comes to her mind even if it has seemingly no basis in reality.In writing a book,you would have thought that she would have had more time to actually think about what she was writing and to check her facts. Sadly,this is not the case. Ms. Coulter seems just so full of venomous hatred and doesn't even try to hide her disgust with people who do not share her rabid opinions. This book really cannot and should not be taken seriously.
