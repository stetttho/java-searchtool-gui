 Hamish MacBeth is back in top form and M.C. Beaton's Highlands constable just keeps getting better and better. This installment is, like the others in the series, fairly light reading and you can polish it off easily in a day. My only complaint about Beaton's books are that they are just too short - I want the pleasure of reading them to last and last! The writing remains crisp and fresh, the characters lively and well-drawn and the mystery well-plotted. What else can you ask for?
