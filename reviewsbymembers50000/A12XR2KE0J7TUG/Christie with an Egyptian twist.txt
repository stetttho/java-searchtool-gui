 Although several of Agatha Christie's mysteries were set in the Middle East, this is the only one set in ancient times. Although historical mysteries were very unusual for Christie, she shows that she could have been a master of the genre if she had tried. Set in ancient Egypt, the characters in this book are so well-drawn and realistic that they practically spring off the page. I would not recommend this book to a Christie novice because I think you really have to have a fine appreciation of the Christie genius to fully appreciate Death Comes as the End.Overall,this is an excellent book that makes me wish Christie had written more of its kind.
