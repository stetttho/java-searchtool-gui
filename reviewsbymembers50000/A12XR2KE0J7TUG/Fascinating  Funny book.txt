 Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers is defintely one of the most unique books I have read in a long time but also one of the best. It's strange to laugh out loud at death and corpses but this book makes you do that. Roach, however, is entirely respectful of her subjects but presents her subject matter in a witty and entertaining way. Great book.
