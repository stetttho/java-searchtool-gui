 My 8 year old son was required to read this book for his 3rd grade reading project. He is not a great reader and it is sometimes like pulling teeth to get him to sit down with a book. He sat down with Because of Winn Dixie one night after supper and by ten o'clock that evening, he was still engrossed in this book. Amazing! It evidently sparked his imagination and interest in a way no other book ever had so I decided to read it myself. It is indeed a lovely,touching book about heartbreak and loss, strength ,renewal and, most importantly, love.The characters really come alive, especially India Opal Buloni and her cherished mutt, Winn-Dixie. I found it hard to put this book down myself and I certainly understand my son's interest in it. This isjust a great book, destined to become a perennial favorite of American schoolchildren and a classic piece of children's literature. Bravo!
