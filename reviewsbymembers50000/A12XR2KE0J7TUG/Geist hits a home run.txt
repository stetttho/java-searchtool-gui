 What a fantastic, funny book. Anyone who has ever been involved with Little League or any organized kids sports league has to read this book. As I was reading Little League Confidential, I kept thinking that Geist, a reporter for CBS, MUST have had a video camera at one of my son's games. So much of what he writes is so hilariously on-the-mark , perceptive and insightful. It was just so much fun to read and very well-written.
