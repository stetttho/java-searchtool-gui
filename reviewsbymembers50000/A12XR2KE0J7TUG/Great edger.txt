 I considered buying a gas edger because of the convenience of not having to worry about a power cord and because I thought an electric edger would not do the job as well. Turns out this edger has all the power I could need for my yard. Very easy to assemble and operate, the Edge Hog is a great deal for the price. I have always been pleased with the reliability of Black and Decker products and so far, this edger has been perfect.
