 If you love baseball, you must own Classic Baseball. This is a superb collection of baseball photographs by the legendary sports photographer Walter Iooss, Jr.  with commentary by Dave Anderson, a winner of the Pulitzer Prize. Everyone is here, all the greats from Maris and Mantle to McGwire and Bonds, along with a host of lesser known players. The photos are simply breathtaking and make you feel you are at the ballpark. All you need is an ice cold beer and a bag of peanuts and you'll feel right at home. A great book and a great gift idea for anyone who loves the game of baseball.
