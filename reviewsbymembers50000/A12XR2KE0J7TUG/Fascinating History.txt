 Kent Weeks did not actually "discover" KV5. That was done by James Burton in the early part of the 19th century. Weeks more or less stumbled upon the entrance to the tomb while working on his Theban Mapping Project. However accidental, you have to give Dr. Weeks his due. The re-discovery of KV5 is perhaps one of the greatest events in Egyptology ever, definitely since the days of Howard Carter. This book is a gripping, detail-filled account of Weeks' excavation of some of the first chambers of the tomb. Yes, there is a lot of detail here about pottery fragments among the debris but Weeks makes it very clear that the debris in the tomb is just as important to learning about the ancient Egyptians as the tomb paintings. Maybe the discovery of KV5 was not flashy enough for some - no rooms filled with gold and riches. Dr. Weeks deserves a lot of credit for his dedicated , painstaking work on KV5 and in the Valley of the Kings in general. This book is perfect for all amateur Egyptologists or anyone interested in ancient history.
