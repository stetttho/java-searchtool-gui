 Having just finished Ann Coulter's venomous right -wing diatribe Treason, I was looking forward to reading this book, only to bring myself back at least to center. Al Franken, to his credit, has a much better sense of humor than Ms. Coulter (who doesn't?) but I was still disappointed in the basic shallowness of this book. Franken started off in comedy and it's just hard to take him very seriously as a political commentator.Some of what he says has a ring of truth to it but , like Coulter, the messenger distorts the message. Coulter and Franken obviously sell a lot of books (I got my copy from the library)so I guess the they are meeting a need somewhere. I just can't help but feel that Franken,like Coulter, is playing a part and laughing all the way to the bank.
