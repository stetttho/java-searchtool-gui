 There aren't very many women who operate commercial lobstering operations and even fewer who can make the enterprise seem fascinating to landlubbers like myself but Linda Greenlaw is definitely one of them. This is not the kind of book that would appeal to everybody but if you like maritime-themed true adverture stories, then I think you'll enjoy this. Definitely not as exciting a tale as The Perfect Storm but what is? I really enjoyed this book.
