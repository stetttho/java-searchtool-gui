 Even people who have not read anything by the great Agatha Christie have probably heard of this book. It is perhaps her most well-known work and has, of course, been made into an Academy Award winning film starring Albert Finney as Poirot. Murder on the Orient expressed has achieved worldwide renown because, simply, it is one of the greatest mysteries written by the greatest mystery writer of all time. It is extremely well-plotted and sharply written. Out of all Christie's books, this one contains the best cast of characters/suspects.The ending is a surprise (even though some other reviewers gave away the solution!) and very satisfying. This is a must-read for all mystery fans.
