 John Paul Jones is, sadly, the most neglected historical figure of the American Revolutionary period. Most of this probably has to do with his personality - vain, egotistical,argumentative and difficult to get along with- rather than his superb skills as a sailor and naval commander. This book ought to bring him to the forefront of the pantheon of American heroes , right alongside Washington, Jefferson and Adams. Superbly written and researched, this is an excellent book and a fitting tribute to the founding father of the Armican navy. Highly recommended.
