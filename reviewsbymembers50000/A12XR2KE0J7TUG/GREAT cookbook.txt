 I'm a big fan of Rachael Ray's Food TV show 30 minute meals and just had to buy this book. There are tons of recipes here, built around themed dining. Most of the recipes are so easy to follow and require ingredients that you can readily buy in your local supermarket. These recipes can really be made in 30 minutes if you are REALLY organized like Ray is on her show and move fast.If not, allow for extra time.I've tried a few recipes from this book and also off the show and they are really good. If you like the show or are looking for fairly quick and easy meals, give this book a try!
