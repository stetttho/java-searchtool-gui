 For all his business acumen, Henry Ford was a vicious, rabid anti-Semite and this book does an excellent job in documenting  his lifelong crusade against the Jewish people. Ford didn't even try to hide his anti-Semitism and it's amazing that there is still a huge portion of the population that has no clue about the racist and discriminatory practices of the Ford Motor Company and the beliefs of its founder and guiding force.This book is indeed very important in that it exposes the truth about Ford and his company for the current generation. Well-written and well-researched. An excellent book.
