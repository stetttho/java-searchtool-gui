 This is a fantastic and superb account of Joe DiMaggio's baseball career and a sad account of his life after baseball.  DiMaggio the player was without parallel. DiMaggio the man apparently fell way short of the mark.and is very sad to realize what a sad, lonely man he really was.Cramer has written a masterful biography of a very complex and complicated man.
