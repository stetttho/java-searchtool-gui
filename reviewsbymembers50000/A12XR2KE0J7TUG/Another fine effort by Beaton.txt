 M.C. Beaton's recent Hamish MacBeth mysteries have paled next to those in the Agatha Raisin series. This book puts Hamish squarely back on solid ground and gets the series back on track after a few less than stellar entries (like Death of an Addict). Death of a Celebrity is a pretty quick read (one day will do if you are a fairly fast reader) but eminently enjoyable, well-written and well-plotted. I just wish Beaton would make her books a little longer, if only to extend my reading pleasure.
