 I have been a fan of SNL from the very first show and eagerly anticipated reading this book. The book is written in an "oral history" format and while this allows the authors to cram in a lot of information from many, many different people associated with the show, it also tends to fracture the narrative a bit. The book feels a bit disjointed, hopping from one subject to another.The anecdotes also become a bit repetitive after a while. The best part of the book was, for me, the parts which dealt with the creation and the first few years of SNL. Reading this book brought back a lot of great memories of the incomparable Gilda Radner and John Belushi. If you're a fan of the show, this book is definitely worth reading but I wish the format had been better.
