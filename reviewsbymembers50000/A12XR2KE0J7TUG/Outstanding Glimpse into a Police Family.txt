 Totally engrossing and well-written,My Father's Gun provides an excellent glimpse into a family that has served in the NYPD for three generations. It documents not just the lives of  cops at work but also the often difficult and stressful home lives of their families. An excellent book for anyone considering a career in law enforcement and for anyone who appreciates good writing. Highly recommended
