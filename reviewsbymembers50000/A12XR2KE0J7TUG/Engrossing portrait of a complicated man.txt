 Gonna Do Great Things: The Life of Sammy Davis Jr. by Gary Fishgall is a well-written, engrossing portrait of a very complicated and conflicted man. Toward the end of his career, Davis had become almost a caricature of his former self and had descended into drug and alcohol addiction. Fishgall takes us from Davis' beginnings in Harlem to his career in vaudeville to his days as a member of the famous Rat Pack. You get the sense from reading this book that Davis had a lifetime desire, almost an obsession to belong, to be accepted and to fit in but it seems as if he was always just on the fringes of everything, just a little removed. Davis became a big star but there was always something missing, something that eluded him. While Davis appeared to the public to be having the time of his life with his Rat Pack buddies, behind closed doors he seemed to be a sad, unhappy man. Fishgall seems to capture the essence of the man as well as the legendary performer. This book is a serious, well-written, well-researched look at a showbiz legend and is defintely not a celebrity hatchet job.
