 ...and I mean that as a compliment Barbara Bush has always been my favorite first lady even though I wasn't too fond of her husband (as President, not personally). Tough and honest but also warm and witty, you always knew where Mrs. Bush stood. This book focuses on the post-Presidential lives of Mr. and Mrs. George H.W. Bush. It's an interesting glimpse into the changes that take place in your life when you are no longer at the epicenter of world power and must adjust accordingly.After reading Reflections, I have gained an even deeper admiration for both Mrs. Bush and the former President. It's clear that they have an extremely close relationship and are true partners in every sense of the word. This book is so much more honest than Hillary Clinton's recent book. Hillary could learn a thing or two from Mrs. Bush. I hope Mrs. Bush continues to write. She is a national treasure.
