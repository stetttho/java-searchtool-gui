 I don't normally read celebrity biographies but as a die-hard I Love Lucy fan, I wanted to find out more about the woman known by the world primarily as Ethel Mertz. Vance's talent deserved more regognition than she's gotten and this book helps to shine the light on her a bit more. It's a well-written, entertaining book which explores Vance's life fromchildhood to her death a few yearsago. It tends to drag a bit after Vance's exit from show business but overall, it's definitely worth reading and a nice tribute to a fine actress
