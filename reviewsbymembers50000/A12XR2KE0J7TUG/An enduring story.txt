 I read this book for the first time in the mid-1970's and recently re-read it. It remains as good and relevant as it was over twenty years ago. Part family history, part chronicle of a terminal illness and part historical commentary,Stay of Execution is the story of Alsop's life and coming to terms with his eventual death. The political insider tidbits are quite fascinating. If you can find a copy of this book,buy it. It's well worth the effort.
