 I've read most of Oliver Sack's books and this one is perhaps my favorite. While I am not deaf myself and cannot begin to comprehend the complexities of living in a world that in so aural-dependent, I think Sacks has done an excellent job of introducing the layman to the world of the Deaf. This book is part a  scientific exploration and part social history. It is probably incomplete as one previous reviewer indicated but I don't think that Sacks meant for the book to be a comprehensive history of the Deaf, nor a complete medical look at deafness. I found the book to be fascinating and , like most of the author's books, left me wanting to know more about the subject.
