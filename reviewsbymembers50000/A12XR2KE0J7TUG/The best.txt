 This is by far the most authoritative, informative and entertaining baseball guide around. It is not, however, objective and Bill James does not keep his likes and dislikes well hidden. The statistical analysis of the game and its players is comprehensive and just awesome You may argue with James over who is the greatest catcher of all time but you can't say he hasn't done his homework. The only quibble I have with this book is James' decision to rate the "ugliest" players of each decade. Why?? Is this necessary in any way, shape or form? Who cares if James considers Randy Johnson "ugly". The inclusion of this category in the book needs to be taken out for all future printings or editions.It serves no real purpose and detracts from the overall greatness of this book.
