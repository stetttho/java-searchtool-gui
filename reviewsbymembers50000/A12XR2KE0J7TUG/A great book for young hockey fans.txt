 With the Mighty Ducks now in the Stanley Cup finals, Paul Kariya is now center stage in the hockey world. This book is a great choice for any young (8-12) hockey or sports fan. Lots of photos of the young Kariya as a kid and as a junior hockey player. Interesting text with lots of biographical details. If you have a child in your life who is dreaming of playing in the NHL one day, this is a great inspirational book about a really nice, decent player, a good role model.
