 Fire Lover is the story of arsonist John Orr and the long investigation and prosecution it took to bring him to justice. This book is very well-documented and well-researched and the writing is crisp and clear. The book does tend to bog down about three quarters of the way through and becomes somewhat repetitive which is what keeps me from giving it five stars. Overall, this is a very good account ofan infamous series of crimes.
