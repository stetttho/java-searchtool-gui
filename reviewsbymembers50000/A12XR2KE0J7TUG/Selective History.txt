 This book should be subtitled "How to leave all the good stuff out and still make a fortune". I'd first like to say that I am not a Hillary-basher or a big fan either. I fall squarely in the middle, sort of like my rating of this book. I don't think you can read Living History without coming away with the undeniable feeling that Mrs. Clinton was extremely selective in what she chose to disclose and that she has tinkered with the truth in regard to several different subjects, especially her husband's now infamous affair with Monica Lewinsky. Sure,that's only a small part of this book but on almost every major subject Mrs. Clinton touches on, you just know that she isn't being quite upfront. However, since it's her autobiography, I'll grant her the right to tell us what she wants us to know. That said, this is not a badly written book and moves along fairly quickly. Objective,it's not and I think I'll wait for another writer of stature to tackle the subject of Mrs. Clinton before I make a final judgement about her place in history and the truth about what she writes in these pages
