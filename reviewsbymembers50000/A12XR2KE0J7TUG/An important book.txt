 This book examines  the story of race and sports in Boston, the last major league city to have an integrated baseball team. The author seems to make a case that racism played a strong role in big time sports in boston and seemingly offers up a lot of evidence to support his theory. Certainly, Boston has been known for having racial problems and I think some of this certainly did carry over into professional sports but I do not think that there is ay evidence of there being a "conspiracy", so to speak, to keep teams in the city segregated or to keep minority players down. This well-written and well-researched book does examine an important subject in an interesting way but seems to overstate the case a bit.
