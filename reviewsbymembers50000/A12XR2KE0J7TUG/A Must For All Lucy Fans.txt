 This is an absolutely fantastic guide to I Love Lucy. The book details Lucille Ball's life and career pre-Lucy Ricardo but mostly concentrates on the evolution and production of the the show. There is a complete,in-depth episode guide, lots of pictures and interviews with many people involved with the show. Entertainly written, well-researched and indispensable for any Lucy Lan, this book is a gem. Highly recommended
