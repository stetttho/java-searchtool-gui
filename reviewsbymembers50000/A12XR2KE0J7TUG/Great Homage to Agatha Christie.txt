 This "Death on Demand" mystery which features Annie and Max Darling is a terrifically fun and witty tribute to Agatha Christie, whom Carolyn Hart plainly idolizes (was Max Darling named after Agatha's husband Max Mallowan?). The plot involves a murder which takes place at an Agatha Christie Centenary celebration. Needless to say, Annie and Max step in and solve the crime with the wit and style fans have come to expect from them. The plot is fresh and fast-paced and never lags. The salute to Christie is an added bonus for Hart's fans.Anyone who loves Agatha Christie, Carolyn Hart or just mysteries in general will appreciate this fine book. Highly recommended
