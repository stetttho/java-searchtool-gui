 Stephen Ambrose is by far the best chronicler of the American soldier during World War II and this book is one of his best efforts. It tells the stories of the seemingly ordinary guys in the trenches and on the front lines and how these "citizen soldiers" , many of whom were still in their teens, literally became men and made their country proud. They truly were, to borrow a phrase from TomBrokaw, the "greatest generation". Reading their stories as told by Ambrose, you realize how right Brokaw was. A great book which justly pays tribute to all the soldiers who fought for American during WWII.
