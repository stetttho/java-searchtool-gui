 This is a very insightful,imaginative, thought=provoking look at how American society is being corrupted and held captive by selfish and greedy corporate executives and politicians. Huffington aims and hits her target on nearly every page.What adds credibility to this account is that Huffington is very familiar with the types she writes about, being the ex-wife of a multi-millionaire former politician. This is an excellent book, very well-written as well as being vastly entertaining
