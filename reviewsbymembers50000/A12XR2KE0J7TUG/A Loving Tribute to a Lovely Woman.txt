 Audrey Hepburn, an Elegant Spirit: A Son Remembers is a truly beautiful anf loving tribute to a Hollywood legend. The photographs in the book are truly stunning and strengthen my belief that it was just impossible for anyone to take a bad picture of the luminous Audrey. What is truly special about this book is the sense that the reader is intruding on the very special love between a remarkable mother and her adoring son. Ferrer lets us see glimpses of Audrey that no other writer has been able to show yet it is clear he still respects her privacy and offers nothing remotely resembling gossip. Ferrer himself seems like a very centered, kind young man and you get the sense that Audrey would have been very proud of him. It's obvious he was exceedingly proud of her. This is a really excellent book and a must for any Hepburn fan.
