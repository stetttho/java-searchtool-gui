 Despite the inference of the title that the recipes contained in this book are "simple", I think that you really have to understand that in Mario Batali's world, these recipes are indeed simple and the dishes he is preparing are considered rustic country cuisine. For the average home cook, I thing the word that "simple" means food that doesn't take a couple of hours to prepare or require you to order ingredients on the internet from specialty stores because you can't find them anywhere. Not all of us live in New York where Italian groceries abound.I like watching Mario's shows on Food TV but let's face it, he is NOT making simple food. Yes, pasta is "simple" but not when you make it from scratch yourselfwith specialty flour. Rachael Ray or Sara Moulton make simple food, not Mario. That said, this book does have some good points. It is very nicely presented and lovely to look at. The food does look delicious and if I get real adventurous someday, I might try a few. If you are looking for a basic Italian cookbook to make simple lasagne or manicotti, do not buy this book.
