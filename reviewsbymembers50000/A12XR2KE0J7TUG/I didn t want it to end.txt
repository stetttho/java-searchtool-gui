 Peter Hessler has written a totally engrossing account of the two years he spent in Fuling, China teaching English at a local teacher's college. Most books of this type tend to focus on the larger cities ,such as Beijing or Shanghai. It was truly an eye opener to see what life is like in a "small" town (pop. 200,000+)like Fuling. The best part of this book is how Hessler grew to love and appreciate Fuling despite its shortcomings. He actually makes me want to visit this intriguing town despite its remoteness. An excellent book.Highly recommended
