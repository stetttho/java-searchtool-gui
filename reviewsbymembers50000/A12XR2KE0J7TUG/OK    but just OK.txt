 This book was hyped so much in the media and the premise sounded extremely promising, especially to all of us working mothers with children. There are some amusing moments here but the book  ultimately falls short of the target.Why? My primary problem is with the main character of Kate Reddy. I found her to be rather whiny and self-absorbed and not really sympathetic.I just didn't like her very much and my reaction to the book has a lot to do with this. It's not a bad novel but I don't think it's going to have much staying power.
