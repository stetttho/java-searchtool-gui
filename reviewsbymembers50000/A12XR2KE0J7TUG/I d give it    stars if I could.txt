 The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt by Edmund Morris is , hands down, the best biography of an American president ever written. It is absolutely absorbing and entertaining  as well as being meticulously researched. Roosevelt absolutely comes alive in this book and it almost feels as if he was assisting Morris with the writing! A superb biography. A classic. Highly recommended
