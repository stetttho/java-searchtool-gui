 Moneyball is an incisive and fascinating look inside the operations of the Oakland Athletics and their  G.M., Billy Beane. The book focuses on how a "small market" team such as the A's can compete with sports behemoths such as the New York Yankees and their free-spending owner, George Steinbrenner. I have doubts that Beane is as much of a genius as portrayed here but he has certainly developed a lot of home-grown talent and made pretty decent trades which have enabled his team to have one of the better winning percentages in baseball over the last few seasons. This book is a must for any baseball fan or for any sports fan interested in the behind the scenes operations of a major sports franchise. Well written and absorbing, highly recommended.
