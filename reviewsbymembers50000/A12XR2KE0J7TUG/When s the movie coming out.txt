 The book presentsan interesting concept about artificial intelligence but while reading Prey I couldn't help wondering when the movie would be coming out. Many of Crichton's books, such as Jurassic Park, have been made into successful movies and I kept feeling that this book was written with a future film adaptation in mind, which is not, in my mind,a good thing. I was mentally casting the characters in my mind and this ultimately proved to be quite a distraction. This is obviously fiction for the masses. It makes you think a little but ultimately it feels like cotton candy which quickly dissolves in your mouth, It just doesn't linger in the mind for long...it's just empty calories; It's not bad but could have, should have been much better.
