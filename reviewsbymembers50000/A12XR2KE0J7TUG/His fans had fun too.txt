 I sure do miss Lewis Grizzard. The best Southern humorist of his generation, Grizzard never failed to make me laugh and often cry. I think that many people mistakenly pigeonhole his humor and writing style as "redneck" but Grizzard was no Jeff Foxworthy or Jerry Clower. He could make you laugh, make you mad and make you think with just one finely honed sentence. He was a master at his craft and this collection shows him at his best. Grizzard died a few years of heart failure and the world is a poorer place without him.
