 Dodd Darin is the only child of the late great Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee, the "Dream Lovers" of the title. I hesitated reading this book because most celebrity biographies written by the children of the subjects are often vindictive, slash and burn tell-alls. Not this book. Dodd Darin has written a touching,honest, heartfelt account of his parents lives, together and apart ,paying tribute to their good qualities while recognizing and accepting their shortcomings. The story told here is often quite sad, especially reading about Dee's current isolation and reclusiveness. The book is very well-written and is a fine tribute to the author's parents. Sandra Dee must be proud of her son.
