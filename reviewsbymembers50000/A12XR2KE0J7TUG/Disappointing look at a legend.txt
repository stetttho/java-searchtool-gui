 First things first: Who on earth chose that horrible cover photo? I guess it was chosen to represent some of the classic faces Lucy perfected on "I Love Lucy", such as the "spider" but the cover photo looks like a National Enquirer sneak shot. Lucy deserves better than this. And she deserves much, much better than this recycled rehash of a biography.If a writer is going to do a complete biography of the greatest female television star of all time, he at least needs to watch the show and PAY ATTENTION!. There are so many mistakes about the plots of some of the shows that is hard to believe this got past an editor. I was very disappointed in this book. There are better books about Lucy available.
