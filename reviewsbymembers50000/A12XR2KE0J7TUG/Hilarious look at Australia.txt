 Bill Bryson is such a talented writer that he could make the phone book funny. This is a laugh out loud look at the land of Oz and our Aussie cousins. Anyone familiar with Bryson knows that this is not a typical travel book which deals with what places to visit, the best places to dine etc. Is is a hilarious look at all those things which make Australia and its people such a fascinating place. Bryson has a knack for really understanding his subjects amd for finding humor in the most trivial things. This is an extremely enjoyable book.
