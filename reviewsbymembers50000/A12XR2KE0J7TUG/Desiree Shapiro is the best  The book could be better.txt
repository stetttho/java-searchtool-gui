 I am a huge fan of the Desiree Shapiro  mystery series and eagerly anticipate reading each new book. Desiree is an endearing heroine,the writing is usually crisp and entertaining, the characters usually intriguing. Murder Can Upset Your Mother falls a little short. The plot is a little murky and difficult to follow at times. Desiree's neice Ellen is becoming a bit tiresome and it would be good for the series if Eichler would develop some better supporting players for Desiree.Let's get Ellen married and have her move to Buffalo or something and get on with it! Despite the shortcomings, I found this book to be an enjoyable and entertaining read. Not rocket science, but a pleasant diversion nonetheless.
