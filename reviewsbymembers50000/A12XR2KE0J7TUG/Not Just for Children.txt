 This collection of African folk tales by Alexander McCall Smith , author of The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, Tears of the Giraffe, et. al., is supposedly aimed at the 9-12 age group. The stories are a bit strong but suitable for most kids in this age group. I would not recommend this book to kids under the age of 8 or 9 because of the somewhat strong themes of the stories. Smith really doesknow Africa and is a pretty gifted writer. I think adults would also enjoy this book
