 Bette Midler is absolutely amazing on this delightful CD.There is no other singer in the music business today who could pull off a CD of Rosemary Clooney songs with the style, sass and class of the original. Midler is absolutely incandescent and just sparkles. There is not one bad song , not one bad arrangement on this entire CD. I could listen to this for hours and, as a matter of fact, I have. Forget Norah Jones and others of the new wave of jazz-influenced singers. Bette shows 'em who's boss. Bravo!!
