 The Devil Wears Prada is not classic literature. It's not even Bridget Jones' Diary. But it is a fun-filled, entertaining way to spend a day or two. That's about the maximum time it would take to read this book. This is the story of Andrea Sachs, a new college grad who dreams of working for a high-brow magazine and ends up working for the boss from hell,Miranda Priestly, the demonic editor of a glossy fashion magazine. What follows is an amusing and often laugh-out-loud-funny account of Andrea's attempt to survive in the world of high fashion.This is really a guilty pleasure. It probaby won't be remembered in a decade but most books aren't anyway. It was a fun, enjoyable read
