 Or rather, Selma Eichler does it again. I'm a big fan of this series and Eichler's plus-sized private investigator, the always feisty yet lovable, Desiree Shapiro. Once again, the plot is well-constructed, this time involving a murder at the bridal shower of Desiree's niece, Ellen. The pacing is quick,the suspects numerous, the red herrings well-placed and the outcome satisfying. Another great entry in this series. Highly recomended for any mystery fan.
