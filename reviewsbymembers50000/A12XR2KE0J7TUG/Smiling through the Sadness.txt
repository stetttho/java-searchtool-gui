 This book is a wonderful look at the many Jewish comedians- from the  Marx Brothers to Jerry Seinfeld- who have made America (and the world) laugh over the years. This book is more than just a superficial look at Jewish humor, however. It's an insightful and thoughtful probe into the sources of Jewish humor and a tribute to the strength and courage of a people who managed to find humor in even the most desperate of circumstances.American humor just would not be the same without Jewish comedic genius. This book clearly points that out. I thought this was expertly written and very entertaining. Highly recommended.
