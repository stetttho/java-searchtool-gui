 Jeffrey Tayler, an American ex-pat. living in Moscow, decided, somewhat on a whim, to be the first non-African since Henry Stanley,to navigate a treacherous and long stretch of the Congo River. A bit naively, he seemed to think that he could do this on his own. As soon as he arrived in Zaire, a barely functioning country, he quickly discovered that his journey could not be undertaken alone and would be far more demanding thean he ever dreamed. Facing the Congo is the story of Tayler's adventure in the country then known as Zaire .And what a story it is! Difficult to put down and exceptionally well written, this book, like the best of travel writing,both entertains and educates. You come away from this book with a feeling of profound sadness over the plight of the average Congolese and the tragic waste of the energies and talents of an entire generation of people in the Mobutu era. Tayler arrived in Zaire a rather naive young man and left much wiser and definitely more humble. The reader will do the same. This is really an excellent book.
