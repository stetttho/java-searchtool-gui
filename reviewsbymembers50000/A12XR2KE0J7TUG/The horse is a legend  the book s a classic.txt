 I just re-read this book after initially reading it about a year ago. At the time of my first reading, I had never heard of Seabiscuit and only picked it up because of the glowing reviews. Boy, were those revies on target! The book is simply phenomenal. It actually makes you care deeply about an animal that has been out of the headlines for decades. I didn't know much about horse racing and not much more about horses but this book is an education in itself. Beautifully written, suspenseful, poignant and always respectful of its subject, this book is a masterpiece, destined to be a classic. I am now a huge fan of Seabiscuit and of the author, Laura Hillenbrand. I highly recommend this book
