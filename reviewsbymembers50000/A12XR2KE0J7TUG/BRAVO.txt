 Let me start off by saying outright that this is simply an excellent book, easily the best biography I've ever read about Franklin. Franklin to me personifies the best America has ever offered the world and displays all those qualities that we as Americans have come to treasure as part of our national character: strength, wisdom, common sense, wit and humor, industriousness,energy and compassion. What sets Franklin apart from the rest of the Founding Fathers, at least in my mind, is the sense that old Ben was "one of us", a brilliant man to be sure, but one whom you could picture having a pint in the corner pub with old friends. This book does a magnificent job in bringing Franklin to life. If only all biographies were as lively and well-written as this! Superb book, superb writing. Highly recommended for any history buff, any lover of great writing and any American who cares about this great country.
