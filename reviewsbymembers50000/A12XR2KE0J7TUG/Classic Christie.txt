 The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is the book that made Agatha Chries famous,not just for its superb storytelling and plotting but for its unique and very surprising conclusion. I've read this book many,many times and I have never ceased to be amazed at Christie's inventiveness and skill. The conclusion is often criticized as being unfair but if you carefully read the book you can see that Christie lays all the pieces of the puzzle on the table for her readers. A great, great  mystery and absolute required reading for any mystery fan.
