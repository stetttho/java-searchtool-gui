 This is an absolutely first rate book about American Jews in the 1920's and the efforts of several Jews, including Al Jolson and gangster Arnold Rothstein, to find a comfortable place in American society. This book has it all- crime, entertainment, law, bootlegging, etc. and is really, really difficult to put down. Excellently written and absolutely riveting
