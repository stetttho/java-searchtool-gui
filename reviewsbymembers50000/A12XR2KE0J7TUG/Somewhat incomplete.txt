 I've read a few of Carlton Stower's previous books and found them in general to be well-researched and well-written. Scream at the Sky felt somewhat incomplete because I don't think that the life and motives of Faryion Waldrip was explored enough. I just didn't get a good understanding of what pushed him to commit these murders. The sections dealing with the victims and the criminal investigation were first-rate, however. I noticed several typos in the book and , while these things happen, it shows that the editing should have been a bit tighter.
