 I've always liked Josephine Tey , especially Brat Farrar, The Singing Sands and The Man in the Queue but, unlike those books, I found this book to be rather dated in terms of plot and dialogue and the character of Miss Pym to be somewhat tedious and pedantic. I don't think it's held up as well as the best of Tey's work. If you've never read Tey before, this is definitely not the book to start with.
