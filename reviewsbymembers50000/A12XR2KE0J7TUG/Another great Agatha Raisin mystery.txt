 Agatha Raisin and the Case of the Curious Curate is another fine entry in this popular long-running series by M.C. Beaton. Beaton has earned rave reviews from critics for her Agatha Raisin series and this entry is a perfect example of why. Agatha is her usual feistry but endearing self and manages to solve another murder in the supposedly sleepy vilage of Carsely. Beaton's writing again is fun, witty and very entertaining.Like all the other entries in this series, the book is rather short and leaves you wanting more. Beaton just keeps getting better and better with each effort. Highly recomended
