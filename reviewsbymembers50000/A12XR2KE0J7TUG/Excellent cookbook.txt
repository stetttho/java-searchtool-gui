 One of the things that I've always liked about Sara Moulton's shows was that the recipes used were fairly easy to follow and not too difficult to prepare. I'm not the greatest cook in the world and tend not to bother with a recipe if it's overly long or too difficult. Most of the recipes in this book are suitable for even cooks with limited skills like myself. They are not at all intimidating (much like Sara herself)and don't require ingredients that can only be found in specialty shops in New York or Chicago. The instructions are real easy to follow. The book also has a lot of nice photos. If you like Sara Moulton's style on TV, you'll enjoy this book.
