 Don't Lets Go to the Dogs Tonight is Alexandra Fuller's witty and wistful account of growing up as the daughter of white immigrants in Africa in the 1970's. This book is a brutally honest look at Fuller's family and their adjustment to a society where they are in the distinct minority. Some members of Fuller's family (mostly her mother) don't come off looking too well and are quite obviously racist. Fuller, however, isn't and came to view Africa as her true "home", a place of magic and mystery, as well as of the mundane and ordinary. This is an enlightening glimpse into growing up in a vastly different culture than our own.Highly recommended.
