 Sorry, I meant C.O, or correctional officer. This is a fascinating and engrossing look at the inside of one of the toughest prisons around. Author Conover worked as a C.O inside Sing Sing for two years and has quite a story to tell. Even if you are not interested in criminal justice, you will find it difficult to put this book down. I definitely have a much better understanding of what it is like to work inside a prison and have a newfound appreciation for what a C.O. goes through on the job. An excellent book
