 Leigh Montville's biography of the late , great Boston Red Sox slugger Ted Williams is certainly the most up-to-date as well as one of the better researched books available about this American icon. Taking us from Ted's unhappy childhood right up to the last sad chapter involving his death and the public battle over his remains waged by his children, Montville provides an engrossing and comprehensive portrait of a very complex and often mystifying man. This book provides an excellent companion piece to David Halberstam's "The Team Mates", which  provides,I believe, a more insightful glimpse into the private life of Wiliams as revealed by some of his closest baseball friends, Dom DiMaggio, Johnny Pesky and Bobby Doerr. Reading both Montville's book as well as Halberstam's will provide any reader with a great overall portrait of the immortal Williams.This is an excellent book for any Red Sox fan or lover of baseball. Highly recommended.
