 I love Bill Bryson and have enjoyed all of his travel books, especially I'm a Stranger Here Myself and Notes From a Small Island. It surprised me that he had written a book like this but, true to form, he has produced an excellent, well-written, incisive and funny look at the scientific world. This is the kind of book that would make someone who hates science or is indifferent (like me) to actually develop an interest in the subject. Now that's great writing! Too bad textbook writers can't write like this! Excellent book,highly recommended.
