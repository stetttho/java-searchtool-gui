 If you're a fan of M.C. Beaton and Agatha Raisin, you will heartily enjoy this book. Agatha is one of the most unique heroines in the history of mystery fiction, maddening and endearing at the same time, and she never ceases to make me laugh out loud.I never understood what she saw in James Lacey and thankfully James has decided to leave Agatha for life as a monk in France. Hopefully, he'll stay there. My only quibble with this series is that some of the supporting characters were getting a bit stale. Beaton has made a good move in ending Agatha's obsession with James and hopefully she will develop some new intriguing characters to bring this series further along.I'd like to see the character of Mrs. Bloxby developed further. There must be a skeleton in her closet somewhere!  All in all, Beaton continues to do an excellent job at entertaining her target audience.
