 Simply Ming is a collection of East-West fusion recipes that are elegant but not too difficult to prepare. Most of the recipes are built around 25 allpurpose flavor bases.Once you learn a flavor base, moving from one recipe to another is simple and easy. Preparation is kept relatively simple and you do not have to be a gourmet to enjoy or replicate these recipes. Ming proves that cooking can be sophisticated but still be fun and easy. This is a very good cookbook, especially for those who like food with an Asian twist.
