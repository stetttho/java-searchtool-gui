 If you are considering buying a purebred dog of any breed, I highly recommend that you thoroughly read this book before doing so. The authors are not anti-purebred but instead protote the idea that mixed breed dogs have so much to offer in terms of health, temperment and companionship  There is an excellent discussion of the likely outcome of pairing between different breeds in order to enable you to select a mixed breed suitable to your lifestyle. The writing style is entertaining and informative. This is an excellent book for anyone interested in adopting any dog
