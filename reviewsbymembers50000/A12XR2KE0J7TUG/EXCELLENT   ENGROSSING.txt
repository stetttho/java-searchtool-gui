 This book is exceptionally well-written and compelling,not at all the dry type of prose normally found in other books of this type or on this subject. This book certainly opened my eyes and seriouslly challenged (and destroyed) many of my long-held perceptions of welfare recipients, especially single women struggling to support families. Odessa Williams, one of the central figures in the book, is a true gem - unselfish, loyal, resourceful, brave and inspiring. This book,like Odessa,is a "winner". Highly recommended.
