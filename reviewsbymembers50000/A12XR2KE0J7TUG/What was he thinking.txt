 I picked up this book (despite the awful reviews in the media)only because I loved Edmund Morris' books  "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" and "Theodore Rex". Bad decision. What on earth was Morris thinking of when he wrote this book? I was never much of a Reagan fan but hoped to maybe get more insight into the man. He must have been pretty much of a blank slate if Morris had to resort to such a stunt to flesh out a story. I just can't take this book seriously andwouldn't recommend it to anyone wanting to find out about the real Ronald Reagan (if this is even possible)
