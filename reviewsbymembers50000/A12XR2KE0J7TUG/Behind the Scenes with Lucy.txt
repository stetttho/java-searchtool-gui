 Jess Oppenheimer, who was a producer of I Love Lucy and wrote many classic episodes, has produced a very enjoyable and engaging behind the scenes look at one of the greatest television shows ever. He provides a lot of insider tidbits on the production of the show and working with the cast. This book would be enjoyed by any fan of the series or of television's golden age. Very entertaining.
