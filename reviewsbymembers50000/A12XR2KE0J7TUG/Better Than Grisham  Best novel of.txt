 I'd give this book more than five stars if I could. This is a real page-turner and the intricate plot just pulled me in from the opening pages. The book jacket indicated that The Emperor of Ocean Park was a John Grisham/Today Show pick but this book is much, much better than anything Mr. Grisham has written lately, especially The Summons. The main characters were very well-developed, particularly law Professor Talcott (Misha) Garland. Forget what you may have read about this book being about "victimization"... NONSENSE!!! Simply put, this is a GREAT book. I loved it from start to finish and cannot wait for Mr. Carter's next work of fiction.
