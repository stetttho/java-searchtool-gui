 Caroline Alexander has written a truly masterful work about one of the most legendary and enduring episodes in maritime history. The Bounty is thoroughly researched and I can't imagine that she has left anything out of her account. Anyone who has read Alexander's book on Ernest Shackleton will know they're in for an amazing time and a real treat. This book is really compulsively readable and incredibly entertaining. It's bound to be the standard against which all future books on this subject are judged, and rightfully so. Bravo!
