 I continue to be so impressed and moved by this series that I am about ready to pack and buy a one-way ticket to Botswana. McCall's writing is so deceptively simple but he packs so much meaning ,depth and lyricism into the most simple of sentences,much like his heroine, Precious Ramotswe.Mma. Ramotswe just bowls me over with he kindness, strength and humanity. The supporting characters are also first-rate, including Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and Mma. Grace Makutsi. This series is getting better and better with each installment. Highly recommended for mystery lovers and everyonewho loves good fiction. Superb.
