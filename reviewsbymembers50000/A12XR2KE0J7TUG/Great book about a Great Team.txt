 The 1975 World Series between the Reds and the Red Sox is righly considered one of the greatest and most memorable ever. The 1975 Red Sox enjoyed one of their best seasons ever due to the exploits of Rice, Fisk, Lynn, Yaz, Tiant et. al. This book is a fine tribute to these great Sox players, the Red Sox organization and the city of Boston. The Sox were so great in 1975 and provided us with so many great memories that it's almost possible to forget that they didn't win the Series. This is a fantastic book for any Red Sox fan, baseball fan or sports fan in general. You don't have to be a Sox fan exclusively to enjoy this book- even Yankees fans would enjoy it ! Well-written and highly recommended
