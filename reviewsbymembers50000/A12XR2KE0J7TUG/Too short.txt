 Bill Bryson is the best travel writer around today. I've enjoyed all his other books (In a Sunburned Country, I'm a Stranger Here Myself,Notes from a Small Island) and I was quite surprised that this book was so short. Only 64 pages! You cannot possibly get the flavor of such a vast continent or country like Kenya in a few short pages. That said, what Bryson does provide is a humorous and illuminating glimpse into his subject but leave you begging for more. The proceeds from this book evidently have gone to charity so I won't complain too much. Overall, a very good read.
