 Although it is such a cliche, I really could not put this book down. I had to once or twice, if only to sleep. This is a fascinating, compelling look at a world and culture most Americans know nothing about and are likely never to come into contact with. This book tells the story of a Puerto Rican family in the Bronx starting in the 1980's and continuing over several years. We meet Lourdes, the family mariarch, her daughter Jessica, son Cesar and a host of other family members and acquaintances. You get to know these people so well you almost feel like you're eavesdropping on private family moments. RandomFamily is exceedingly well-written,gritty and insightful. Highly recommended
