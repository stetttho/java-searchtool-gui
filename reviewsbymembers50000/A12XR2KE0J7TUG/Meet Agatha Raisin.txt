 Agatha Raisin is certainly one of the most unique heroines in all of mystery fiction. She is loud and bossy, opinionated and often rude, quick-tempered and impatient. Sounds pretty off-putting but it's amazing how Beaton has made her readers come to care about and love the fictional character of Agatha Raisin. It's because behind all her bluster and bravado, Agatha is a decent, warm-hearted person who just wants to fit in life in Carsely, her adopted hometown in the Cotswolds. Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death is the first in this series and is one of the best. After moving to Carsely, Agatha attempts to plunge into village life and enters a quiche-baking contest. Agatha is stricty a defroster and microwaver so she enters a store-bought quiche in the contest which ends up killing one of the judges. The plot is truly funny and enormously entertaining.The supporting characters are first-rate and the solution to the murder is really satisfying. It's hard not to read this book and not immediately look forward to the next one. Beaton is an excellent writer and she has created a gem of a character in Agatha Raisin. Excellent book
