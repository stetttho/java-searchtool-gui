 I've read every book in the Faith Fairchild series and have been generally pleased that the author has kept up the quality of the plotting and writing over the years.While I enjoyed this book fairly well, it just seemed a little off the mark. The references to popular teen culture (music, PC games etc) seemed a bit forced. The plot involving hate crimes at a upper-crust boarding school seemed to peter out and appeared to be used just for effect. The character of Daryl may be black but there is nothing in Page's characterization of him that is genuine and rings true. The same is true of the hate crimes plot.Page can do much, much better than this.
