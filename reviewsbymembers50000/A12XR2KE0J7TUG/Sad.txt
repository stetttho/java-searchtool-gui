 First, let me say that I am no great fan of President Bush and didn't vote for him although I find him more tolerable now than I ever imagined I would . The very concept of this book is so sad and the title itself is really appalling. How often did supporters of Bill Clinton decry books of this sort written about the former president as being unfair, unbalanced and disrespectful? I guess now that the Republicans occupy the White House, turnaround is fair play. This book offers very little in the way of true journalism or a serious, thought-provoking look at the many problems facing our country today. I'm sure the title alone will help sell a few more books but there are far better books out there which offer a serious, scholarly look at the Bush presidency.
