 This s a very enjoyable, very entertaining story about six MIT students and their teacher/mentor who devised a system of counting cards in an effort to break the bank in Las Vegas. The writing is crisp and the story moves along at a fast pace.I must admit I still really don't grasp the mathematical theories about card counting but I enjoyed this book tremendously anyway. Anyone who hasever played a hand of blackjack will appreciate this book.
