 The Big Four represents one of Agatha Christie's early attempts at a "conspiracy" type mystery.Those familiar with some of her later efforts in this genre, such as "Passenger to Frankfurt" are aware that Christie and conspiracies definitely do not mix. In this case, we have Hercule Poirot concerned with unmasking the "Big Four", a group of criminal conspirators trying to take over the world, so to speak. Poirot doesn't fit in this book and the plot seems rather contrived and artificial. The whole thing falls rather flat and Christie should have reaklized that she should have stuck to what she knew best.
