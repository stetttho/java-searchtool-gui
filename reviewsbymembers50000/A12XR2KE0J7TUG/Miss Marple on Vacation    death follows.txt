 Miss Marple is once again on holiday due to the kindness and generosity of her nephew. Where Miss Marple goes, death seems to follow,even on a Caribbean vacation. This is a real fun Christie, with a good plot, exotic (for that time, anyway) locale, good characters and good detective work by Miss Marple. Excellent reading,highly recommended.
