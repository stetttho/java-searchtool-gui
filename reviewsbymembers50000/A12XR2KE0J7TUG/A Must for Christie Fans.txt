 As one who worships at the altar of Agatha Christie, I found this book to be a comprehensive reference guide to the greatest mystery writer of all time. Everything relating to Christie and her immortal creations of Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Tommy and Tuppence et.al. is here. Well-written,well-organized and extremely informative, this book is a must for any Christie fan or mystery lover. Highly recommended.
