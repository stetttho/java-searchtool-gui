 In the hands of a lesser writer, this book could have been way too saccharine and over-done. While I would not consider it a classic, I think Mitch Albom has done a fine job with this story. This is basically the story of Eddie,an elderly man who thinks his life has been meaningless. Eddie passes away and we get to see how his life really did have meaning and how he unknowingly touched those around him. Sort f like It's a Wonderful Life even though Jimmy Stewart didn't die in that one.I thought this book was well-written and very touching.I think that people have become so jaded that we can't always see the simple beauty in a story like this. You need to have an open mind and an open heart to really enjoy this book. I highly recommend it
