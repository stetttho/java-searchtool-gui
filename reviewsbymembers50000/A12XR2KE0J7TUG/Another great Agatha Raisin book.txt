 Agatha Raisin and the Witch of Wyckhadden is one more piece of evidence that M.C. Beaton is one of the most gifted mystery writers around today. The character of Agatha Raisin is infuriating and endearing at the same time. Great plot, excellent characters and and witty dialogue are all hallmarks of this terrific series. I would recommend that anyone starting to read this series begin with the very first book (The Quiche of Death) and work your way down the list. This is a fun, entertaining and very satisfying mystery . Highly recommended.
