 Like several other reviewers here this was my first encounter with Myron Bolitar and his exceedingly odd group of friends.  I actually listened to it on tape, and so was drawn into the generally gripping plot line.    When it was over, I did not say "Whew, what a master."  But I  did think enough of it to pick up "Backspin" and try reading it  in print.  Within the first 30 pages there were so many unbelievable  encounters, bizarre characters, improbable coincidences, and melodramatic  incidents that I started re-considering the whole experience.... And  discovered that all those reactions applied to this book as well.  I won't  spoil it for those who wish to give it a go, but Myron's entire circle of  acquaintance, and the circumstances in which he finds himself, pass  incredulity into fantasy. As another astute reviewer below has put it,  it's better than Lutz/Estleman, but not even close to Lawrence Block, let  alone the immortal Spenser.  And, oh yes: Win vs Hawk?  Hawk, no question.   Win would be admiring his reflection in Hawk's sunglasses.  :>). And  please - don't say this review wasn't helpful just because it wasn't  positive!  Thanks.
