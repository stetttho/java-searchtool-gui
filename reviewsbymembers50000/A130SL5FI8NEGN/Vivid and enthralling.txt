 Having just panned John Eliot Gardiner's recent recording of Dixit Dominus (Philips, Nov. 2001), I will only say here that this disc is eminently satisfactory for all the reasons cited in the other reviews.  I'm especially taken with the solo work, and with Ms. Massis in particular - her account of Saeviat Tellus is a marvel. Minkowski gives the Dixit all of its startling, vivid color and the live performance seems to add to the lustre.  Don't hesitate to invest in this recording - it will repay you with hours of listening pleasure.  Stanley Sadie is right!
