 Nice warm drawings (though a little stilted, as another reviewer has noted.)  The "descriptions" of the instruments - how they sound and what they evoke - are OK, I guess.  But I have to point out a significant omission: the trombones! Not only are they one of the funnier-looking instruments, but indispensible in the brass section as well. It would be very embarassing to have to explain their absence to an alert child - I'd avoid the book on that account.
