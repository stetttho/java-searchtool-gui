 If we claim that the Bible is the Word of God, alive and active and with the power to "read us", just exactly how does that work?  What does that insight look and feel and taste and sound like?  The early Church  Fathers (from Augustine in the 300s to Bernard in the 1200s) knew, and  wrote extensively about their experience.  Their experience can be ours as  well: God never changes, and humans do slowly (if at all.) Dr. Herbert,  through years of participation in chant-based liturgies, discovered the  roots of that form of Christian worship in the writings of the Church  Fathers.   Their method of scripture study is contemplative in nature,  communal in form, comprehensive in biblical depth, and always has Jesus as  its center.  Just because Dr. Herbert speaks reverentially of Wisdom in no  way indicates Gnosticism -- let's not let the dread of heresy deny us our  legitimate access to God's promise of enlightenment and guidance into His  Truth.   This book shows an ancient and very deep approach to God and Dr.  Herbert deserves our gratitude for his patient, clear, and humble  explanation of it, and for his musical erudition and guidance.
