 The other reviews are right: a little light for the price, but Bad alone is worth it, and the other three songs are tasty also.  I especially like Three Sunrises, a cheery number that sounds like a tribute to the Mamas and the Papas <g>. One thing no one's noted, though: Bad ends with a rarity, an actual solo by Adam! and very nice it is, too.
