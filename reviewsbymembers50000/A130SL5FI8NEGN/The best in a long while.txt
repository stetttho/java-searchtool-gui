 For several years now I have felt like Parker was phoning it in - many of the recent Spenser books have had unconscionably wide margins and low page counts - but this recent outing must be considered a return to form.  All the usual dry banter with Hawk and Susan is as enjoyable as always, as is Spenser's smart-mouth style and grace under pressure.  But there is also a strong plot line to carry the story forward, a genuine puzzle that widens, deepens and resolves very satisfactorily. The best part, however, is getting to spend quality time with almost all the hard cases Spenser has charmed in the past, including the inimitable Bernard J. Fortunato.  There are indeed seven of them, contrary to another review's count: a conscious homage to the Magnificent Seven. They are a tough crew indeed - honorable after their fashion, but as Hawk very memorably states at the end, not like Spenser.  If I were to quibble, it's that the climactic gunfight misses the last degree of intensity and reality, and many of the true bad guys don't get their full comeuppance.  But it is still worth the trip to get there: you're in the hands of a master, writing at the top of his game.  This series is a national treasure, and he can't write enough of them.
