 This is a expert blend of biography and history, striking an admirable balance between the two genres.  You really do get much of the best of both worlds here: the intimate views of carefully researched biography, and fresh perspectives on well-known world events (especially the decisions on the timing of D-Day and the meetings of the Big Three.)   It is particularly remarkable in that the personalities and accomplishments of either man, and the overwhelming events they faced, could have swamped the tale in any direction.  Indeed, one has to admit that Churchill tends to dominate.  But his written and oral volubility naturally had that effect, and since Roosevelt ultimately carried  the military trumps, and was the more elusive and interesting character, he more than holds his own. I especially appreciate Meacham's light-handed, even deployment of his research material.  One never feels that he is relying exclusively on one or two sources, or just transcribing his whole notebook.  Instead, the depth and shading in the portrayal of each man extends to their primary family and professional relationships as well: Harry Hopkins, Eleanor Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin, and both Randolph Churchills, are people I now want to know better. Meacham is going for something deeper and more tender than portraiture, however - a study of friendship, perhaps the least understood human relationship.  I had no idea how much time they spent together, and each of their meetings is chronicled day by day for details of their actual interactions, and their real feelings about each other.  I think he gets pretty close to truth - a relationship full of humanity, respect, affection, and genuine love, consummated in truly extraordinary circumstances. All this, and it's a sensible length.  Definitive, deeply satisfying, and highly recommended.
