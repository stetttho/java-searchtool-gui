 In his (very helpful) bibliography, Holden acknowledges that few poker books can be recommended on stylistic or literary grounds.  If he hoped that his effort would join Alvarez or Mamet's writings on the king of card games, I'm afraid he's disappointed.   Though it is a straight chronological account of his activities at the fringes of the high-stakes world over a one-year span, it uneasily mixes in personal biography, some half-formed self-awareness work, and an obsessive reckoning of his immediate financial position.  It may concern him, but it never grabbed me.    We read books about gambling to vicariously experience the tightening tension and climax of a big hand.  This requires skillful character sketching, and a certain amount of pacing.  Holden rushes in and out of so many games, large and small, that we are never sure if this game is The Big One - nor, eventually, do we care.  Since he doesn't write grippingly about the players of the inevitable showdown hands, and his personal narrative is not very interesting or clear, the revelation of what he was feeling at any given point during the year is pretty dull. One thing is obvious: he was very very nervous a lot of the time, discovering his limitations at the gaming tables and worrying about his bank roll.  I admire his frankness in this regard, but it isn't easy reading.  The final effect is probably pretty accurate, though: he deliberately decided to live "out of his league" for a year, and learned a lot from the experience.  A clearer narrative, a better editor, and a few years of perspective might have made a better book.  How about a second edition, Tony, with more tales from the infamous Tuesday Night Game? Three stars, just for existing, though - would that Tom Wolfe or Norman Mailer would tackle this most fascinating of worlds!
