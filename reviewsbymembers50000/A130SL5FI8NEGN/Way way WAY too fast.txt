 Do these performances have anything at all to recommend them?  Yes: it is interesting to hear non-autograph manual changes on a modern recording of Bach's organ works.  Younger organists who know only the monochromatic everything-pleno performance practices of contemporary players may profit from studying Newman's approach to concertato interpretation. But ye gods!  the playing is out of control.  Another review praises the lack of "adagio boring stuff", but there is no virtue in speed alone - in a piece such as the C major trio (BWV 529) it verges on blasphemy.  It would be laughable, if it wasn't disturbing.  This is music written with a higher purpose than mere virtuoso display, so the shockingly fast tempi are all about Newman, not about Bach. I will admit that the Passacaglia comes off best (even at this pace) and I do appreciate his over-the-top cadenza with the following grand rallentando: too many performances never really "bring it all home."  But please don't look to this as your only recording of these masterpieces.  There is far more depth and delight in this music than Newman's flashy approach can ever reveal.
