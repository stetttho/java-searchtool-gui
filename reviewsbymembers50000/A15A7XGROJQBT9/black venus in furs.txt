 Ok,I must first admit that Miss Price is my favorite diva, so this review will be biased.  Yet this cd is a great introduction for even those unfamiliar with the greatest Verdi soprano of the 20th century.  You will hear her in Aida, Un Ballo, Ernani, and Otello, and you will see her too.  This series, "The Singers," has the added bonus of a cd-rom feature that lets you look at glamour photos of Price from her Decca years, and believe me, this is a woman who looks divine in her furs.  You can also print out the photos of her if you've been unlucky with your E-bay auctions.  Furthermore, you will find the texts to the arias and songs on the disc, which is an inconvenience for those without a computer.  It would have been nice to have had both the texts on the cd and in the skimpy booklet included, for Price, Nilsson, London, Sills, and the others in this series deserve deluxe packaging for their deluxurious voices.
