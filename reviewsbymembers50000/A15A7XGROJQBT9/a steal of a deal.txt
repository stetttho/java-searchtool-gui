 The selections here are from two live recitals, and Miss Price is in fine fettle.  Her "Vissi d'arte" is perfectly placed and gorgeously sung as is "Summertime," which is more beautifully rendered here than on the studio recording with her former husband, Warfield.  And it's so cheap for the excellent sound (and that's high praise coming from one who hates most live recordings).
