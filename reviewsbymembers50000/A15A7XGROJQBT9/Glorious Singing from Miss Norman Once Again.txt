 After watching a Met production of Fidelio (with Mattila and Pape), I decided to give the opera another try.  I hadn't liked it when I listened to the Ludwig-Vickers version a few years ago.  What was wrong with me?  Fidelio is a remarkable work of art, and the quartet "Mir Ist so Wunderbar" in Act I is among the most sublime music ever written.  In this recording, Norman is clearly the star, yet the other soloists are quite fine too.  Along with this recording, I'd also bought a version with Birgit Nilsson and must say Norman is far, far better in the role of Leonore; she reminds me more of Flagstad because the voice is more traditionally beautiful than Nilsson's.  (Yet I have to say I have Nilsson's recordings of Un Ballo, Macbeth, and Aida, and she sounds as magnificent as those other two divine singers, so perhaps, I should just say that Nilsson isn't in best voice on the Fidelio recording.)  Leonore and Rosina (in Nozze) are two of Norman's finest vocal achievements on record.  It seems this cd set has gone out of print, so snatch it up when you have a chance; otherwise, it will be a sinful omission from your music library.
