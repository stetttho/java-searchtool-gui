 Unless you have a previous exposure to opera, you might take Brightman for a diva, yet she is unworthy of this honorific.  Her weak, unsupported, pale English voice has no right singing such arias as Rusalka's "O, Moon, on High" (look to an authentic diva such as Lucia Popp or Renee Fleming for a heart-stopping rendition of this Dvorak piece) or Puccini's "Nessun Dorma" (seek out a tenor such as Jussi Bjorling, Franco Corelli, or even the much lighter-voiced Pavarotti, pre-Three Tenors-phase please, to hear a authentic rendition of Calaf's declaration of love.  Run, run as fast as you can to get away from this cd: it's vile and an insult to opera composers and singers who work very hard at perfecting their art and are not heartily rewarded by the record companies these days (because of such also-rans as Brightman, Bocelli, Church, and Watson).
