 If you love Puccini, if you love his opera Turandot, if you love Leontyne Price, you must buy this recording immediately and begin playing it all the time.  It's unbelievable how high the quality of the sound recording is too.  If the clapping were edited out, one could easily mistake this for a studio recording, but it's so satisfying to know that Nilsson, Di Stefano, and Price sounded so glorious when performing live.  (Nilsson's only rival at the Ice Princess is Leonie Rysanek, and she gives her competition as to who should wear the crown for best "In questa Reggia.")  The supporting roles of Ping, Pang, and Pong are also well sung, and the orchestra of the Vienna Staatsoper is in quite fine fiddle.  I can't believe this recording isn't better known because it really is stunning for the performances and the sound.
