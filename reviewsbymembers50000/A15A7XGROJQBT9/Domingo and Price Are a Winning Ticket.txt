 Domingo sounds glorious on this live recording, which has excellent sound by the way--no irritating audience coughs or distracting cast member stage tromps and clomps--,and Price is even more luscious.  Margaret Price was a Mozartian soprano who grew into the Verdi, Strauss, and Wagner reps. and is saddly underrated these days, yet the voice here is ravishingly beautiful, even throughout the range, top notes unfurling like bright banners against a summertime sky.  She has the voice of a queen as is fitting for her role as Elisabetta.  Listen to the love duet between Don Carlos and his future step-mother in Act I (this is the 5 act Italian language version) and remain unmoved if you can.  While the set comes with no libretto, for the price, this truly is a best buy.  And if you already own the Giulini recording of Domingo and Caballe, you need no other libretto anyway.  The Eboli of Obraztsova is a little wild vocally, the runs aren't as clean as they should be, intonation is approximate in places, but she has the necessary b-flats and the crowd goes mad after her first aria (one would do well to listen to either Olga Borodina's Veil Aria on Haitink's Philips set or Baltsa's on Karajan's EMI for better examples of Verdian line and style).  If you love Don Carlo as much as I, don't hesitate to add this to your library, and if you've always wanted a copy but found the 3-cd studio sets too expensive, this is the one to get.
