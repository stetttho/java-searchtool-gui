 A question: Is there anything that Renee Fleming cannot sing?  Of course, there are roles she shouldn't sing;  she has made the misstep of performing Massenet's Manon (leave that to Bidu Sayo or a younger Kathleen Battle), Gounod's Marguerite (leave that to La Stupenda herself), and Bernstein's Cunegonde (leave that aria to no one for it's a vile piece of work--but the lovely Barbara Cook did make a silk purse from this sow's ear of a song).  Yet one can forgive Miss Fleming for these errors because she is so prodigiously talented.  On this new collection of bel canto arias, she proves herself the equal of Sutherland, Caballe, Callas, and Freni and need offer no apologies for the selections she's chosen.  Of course, there will be those evil opera queens who won't want to admit Fleming into this pantheon, but she has entered the gates of greatness already.  With those annoying sighs held in check mostly (one wonders if Patrick Summers is responsible for this), Fleming creates the even line necessary for the bel canto style.  And she brings a pathos to these characters that reminds one of Virginia Zeani's creations.  There is a melancholy in the voice that goes directly to the heart of the listener.  Listen to the Armida selections if there's still any doubt that Fleming is one of the greats.  While the Lucrezia Borgia selections aren't to my taste, she proves her Donizetti mettle in the arias from Maria Padilla.  This is an artist at the peak of her form, in full control of the voice and in possession of the musicianship necessary to execute the treacherous runs in Rossini, Donizetti, and Bellini.  This is one beautiful voice paying tribute to the beautiful songs of the three great Italian composers before Verdi and Puccini.
