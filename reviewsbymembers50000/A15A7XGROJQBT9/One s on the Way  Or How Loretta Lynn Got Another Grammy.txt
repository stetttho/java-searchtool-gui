 This woman is an American original, just like her male counterpart Johnny Cash.  Ever since I watched the film biography of her life, Coal Miner's Daughter, I've loved Loretta Lynn and her music; she's uncompromisingly honest and true.  From "Van Lear Rose," a love song for her mother and father which describes how they met and fell in love; to "God Makes No Mistakes," a meditation on the capricious nature of a Christian god who gives "no reason for what he does.  God makes no mistakes"; to "Miss Being Mrs.," another love song, this time for her beloved and much-missed Dolittle; Lynn writes songs that show at seventy, she's still got the biting wit and large heart that made "One's on the Way," "The Pill," and "Fist City" classic country standards.  And she looks mighty fine on her album cover too.
