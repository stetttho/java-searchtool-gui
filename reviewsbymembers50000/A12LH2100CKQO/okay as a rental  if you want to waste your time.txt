 Read the other 2/3-star reviews and you'll get a good feel for this movie.  The two lead gay characters were too dysfunctional for me.  One is the child of alcoholic parents.  The other is the child of 2 pyschologists.  Both guys have issues, and it's played-up.  It is a romantic comedy.  I was surprised that Eli was still interested in Tom after catching him in a one-night stand after Eli and Tom had already gotten to know each other; and Eli never talked about it.  I recommend this DVD as a rental (if it's available in your area), but not as a purchase.
