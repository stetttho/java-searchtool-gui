 I received this game as a gift and I am very impressed.  The graphics and sounds are great.  The game play is tough, but realistic (even on the easy level).  It definitely is not a fast paced First Person Shooter; you have to take your time, look carefully, and shoot to kill.  If you hear the VC talking, then it's all over.  The briefings are excellent.  I highly recommend this game.  The AI is excellent and it's easy to control your squad.  I think this is one of those games that got lost in the shuffle of other mainstream games, and that's why it is not more popular.  Take your time and enjoy it!
