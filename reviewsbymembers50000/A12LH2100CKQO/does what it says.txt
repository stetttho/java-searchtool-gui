 I used this motion sensor with the Heath Zenith Indoor Lamp Converter, Model# RH-6012-WH.  The motion sensor sent a signal to the converter to turn-on a light inside the house when someone walked around the outside.  It worked just fine.  The batteries lasted a long time.  The motion sensor has several controls: 1) you can set it to come on at night or day/night, 2) you can set the motion sensitivity, and 3) it can cause the converter to turn-on a lamp/appliance for 1 min or 5 min before the converter turns off the lamp/appliance.
