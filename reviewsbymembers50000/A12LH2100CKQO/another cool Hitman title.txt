 I played Hitman 2 first and then backtracked to Contracts.  I enjoyed the cinematography and the storyline as well as the game play.  Some reviewers note some flaws, but I didn't examine the game with a fine-toothed comb; as long as games are made by humans, there are gonna be flaws.  It seems you can't go wrong with the Hitman titles.  It will provide hours of entertainment.  Enjoy!
