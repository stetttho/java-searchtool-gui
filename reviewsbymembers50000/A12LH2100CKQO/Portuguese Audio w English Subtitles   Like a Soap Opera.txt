 Those are the two main things you need to know about this movie.  It is Portuguese Audio with English subtitles; and you have to read fast at times because sometimes they talk fast.  They constantly flipped between 3 possible loves, and I found this annoying (rather than just playing each one through).  Each possible love was too much like a soap opera, and I don't like soaps.  I recommend renting it rather than buying.
