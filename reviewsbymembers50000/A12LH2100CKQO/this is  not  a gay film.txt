 ------------------ PROs ------------------ 1) The scenery is pretty. 2) There are some creative nature shots (of flowers and rainy scenes). 3) Griffith is cute. 4) There is not much sex (there tends to be too much sex in gay movies).  ------------------ CONs ------------------ 1) It's *not* a gay movie. 2) The movie has numerous slow parts that drag. 3) Enough of the crazy mom/aunt! 4) It would have been nice to see more relationship development between Griffith and Lee (not necessarily sex). 5) Did I mention that the movie drags? 6) Too much, long, drawn-out drama with the mom/aunt.  ------------------ Movie Summary ------------------ This is *not* a gay film!  It's about a lonely guy on a farm.  He has sex with his female cousin because he is bored.  He takes care of his crazy aunt/mom who has never recovered from the death of her sister and brother-in-law (which she caused by sleeping with him and then they got into a car wreck when everybody found out about it).  Griffith rents a cottage.  A drifter named Lee "rents" it (works on the farm to cover cost of rent).  Lee is gay (but straight acting); he falls in love with Griffith, but does not express his love outside of a roommate and best friend relationship.  They both plan to leave the farm to escape the cousin and crazy mom/aunt.  Just before they leave, Lee tells Griffith that he is in love with him.  Griffith is shocked (and so was I) because he always thought they were just good buddies (which they were).  They have a short fight.  Lee leaves.  Then Lee comes back to apologize for some things he said during the fight.  Griffith (a little confused and still dazed) embraces Lee and gives him a kiss.  Lee leaves and Griffith stays at the farm, forever destined to care for his crazy mom/aunt.  ------------------ The Bottom Line ------------------ There just isn't anything gay about it! (except Lee)  Griffith was just a lonely guy on a farm who needed some male companionship (and there's nothing wrong with that...he didn't need nor did he want gay companionship).
