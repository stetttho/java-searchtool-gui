 There are not many good, non-porn gay movies out there, which you may have noticed.  If you want a movie that you could share with your co-workers and not be embarrassed, this is it!  This movie made me laugh, it was cute, it was professional, and it was fun.  It had some serious parts too, but in the end, it made me feel good.  Very good entertainment.  It's not a coming-out flick (although it hits on that issue) and it's not an AIDS movie.  I rented it and then ended-up buying it.  Enjoy!
