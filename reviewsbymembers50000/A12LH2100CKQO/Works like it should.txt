 I just bought one.  The tape performs like it should.  TDK is a decent brand, so I'm hoping that it will last a while.  TDK endless cassette tapes come in several lengths (1 min., 3 min., 6 min., and 12 min.).  I wanted the 6- or 12-min. tape, but I can't find it anywhere (not even from TDK)...everyone says "out-of-stock".  So, 3-min. will have to do.  Good luck!  The Amazon description and shipping weight are wrong. Here is the description from the manufacturer:  Ideally suited for answering machines and any application that requires an endless cassette, TDK Endless Cassettes can be played in horizontal and vertical systems, including those with auto reverse. TDK Endless Cassettes are designed to withstand repeated use and provide unmatched longevity. They feature a special cassette mechanism and high quality Ferric position tape. ***Not suitable for telephone answering machines that rely on metal sensing foil.***
