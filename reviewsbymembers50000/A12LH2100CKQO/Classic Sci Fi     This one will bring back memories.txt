 I only saw a few of these episodes when I was a kid.  It's fun to watch the whole series from the beginning and in order.  I was able to find a substantially lower price at another popular website, so I couldn't resist snapping-up this classic.  It's funny how some of the stories have been re-used by other, more recent shows (i.e., same story, different sets/props/effects/actors).  If you're familiar with the series, you'll enjoy this.  If you're looking for a modern sci-fi series, you may want to keep looking.  The video and sound quality are just fine.  All the shows are here plus a bonus disk.  Enjoy!
