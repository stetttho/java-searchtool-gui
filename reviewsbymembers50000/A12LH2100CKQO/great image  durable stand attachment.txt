 I love this webcam! The image is really good even in low light. The software allows you to customize the picture to improve the image depending on your lighting situation. The installation was a breeze. The microphone works like a charm.  The arms/stand/attachment works great and it is durable (despite what other reviewers have been saying). I care for my laptop and related equipment as if it was a delicate electronic device (which it is). The webcam comes with a hardshell case that stores the webcam and the cord. The hardshell case only protects the webcam if you use it!!! Also, a portion of the webcam folds-up into itself in order to protect the camera eye when not in use...another great feature. And the arms/stand/attachment also folds-up into the webcam when not in use...and this protects the unit from damage. The webcam is well packaged by the manufacturer and was not damaged during shipment (amazon.com included even more padding in their box).  I highly recommend this little webcam for the size, the image quality, and its durability. And amazon.com's price is great...especially with the rebate!
