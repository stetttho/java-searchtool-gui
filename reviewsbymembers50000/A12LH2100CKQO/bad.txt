 Talk about gay stereotypes!  If this is what Boston is like, I'll never go there.  This is about a selfish gay man who thinks he is hot (and therefore sleeps around a lot).  He falls in love with a guy who is not as good looking as him.  He then cheats on him, and then the guy leave him. Then, in the end, the stud sleeps wtih a guy that he slept with a long time ago without realizing it. And this twice done psycho trick lectures him about caring for people.  During the movie, you get to hear the guy interact with his queenie friends.  This movie will leave you depressed.  It gives "gay" a black eye.
