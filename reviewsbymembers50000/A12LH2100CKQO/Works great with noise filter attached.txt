 As another reviewer noted, the transformers are marked for "transmitter" and "speakers", so be sure to use the right one for each item.  The package also contains a noise filter, which you may or may not need to use.  In my case, in order to get clear/consistent sound from both speakers, I had to use the noise filter.  I'm glad I made this purchase.  I did not pay full price; I bought mine used/refurbished.  If you pay full price, then you might be disappointed.
