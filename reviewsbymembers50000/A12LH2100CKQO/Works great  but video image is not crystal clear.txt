 I purchased 2 of these webcams, thinking that I could use them for a home surveillance/security set-up.    Here are the problems I experienced:   1) As with any webcam, your light source should not be behind the object; when pointing the webcam out a window near my front door, the bright background lighting caused the close-up image in my entry way to be dark. On the other hand, when viewing my backyard, it worked fine.  You can adjust the image/lighting with the software, but that also has its limitations.  2) When I hooked-up both webcams to my PC, I received an error about not enough bandwidth; this was disappointing because I had hoped to hook-up 2 or 3 webcams to one PC (one for each side of my home).  Maybe someone knows how to solve this problem?   3) The video quality was not crystal clear.  It was a little fuzzy, especially for distant objects.  The good stuff:  The cordless feature performed great!  The unit is attractive and small.  You don't have to use a 9V battery for the camera since it includes an A/C power cord.  With the 9V battery, the camera will shutdown after 10 minutes if it does not sense any movement (powersave feature); with the A/C power cord, it stays "on" all the time unless you turn it off. Although the included instructions were minimal, I really didn't need them to figure-out how to use the webcam; just make sure that the webcam and the software are set to the same channel (1, 2, 3, or 4).  There is a button on the top of the webcam that you need to hold down for a couple of seconds in order to power-up the webcam.  Conclusion:  If the image quality was better and if I could hook-up 2+ webcams to one PC, then I would have kept these webcams instead of re-selling them.  If you don't need a crystal clear image and you want cordless, then you'll be happy.
