 I have to post a review when I see a gay movie that is actually worth watching, because there are so many that are just garbage.  Here are the highlights of this movie: * It's not overrun by sex. * The actors can act (how novel is that?!). * The storyline is decent and engaging. * This is a coming-out story of sorts, but it doesn't dwell on it. * It's not a "dying of AIDS" story. * It will make you laugh, cry, and leaves you with a good feeling at the end.  Buy it or rent it.  Either way, you'll be entertained.  Enjoy!
