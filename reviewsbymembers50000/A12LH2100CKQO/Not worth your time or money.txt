 Is there a gay theme to this movie?  Yes.  But that's about it.  The movie is not touching.  The acting is lackluster.  There just isn't anything special about this movie.  It's very bland.  It tells a story, but there is no real point to the story.  Do you want a quality movie that you'll remember for a long time?  One that you can watch again and be proud to own?  Then get "Maurice - The Merchant Ivory Collection".
