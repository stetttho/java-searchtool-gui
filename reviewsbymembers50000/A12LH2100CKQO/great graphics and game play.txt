 This is my first spuad-based game.  And what a deal!  It pays to wait until 3 games are packaged into a gold or platnium edition!  The training session was helpful.  You control 3 separate squads, and you are a member of one squad.  As a team, you assualt the enemy and complete the objectives.  You control where and how the teams move (and during set-up, you can choose your team members and their weapons...or just let the computer do it for you).  I learned to tell my squads where to go and then start/stop them every so often to look around and fight the enemy.  You have 3 main screens; the action screen where you see all the pretty graphics; the soldier screen where you can check health status and switch between different soldiers (you can change to any soldier on any of your squads and assume his role...really cool!); the map screen where you plan the route that your squads will take.  I also really like the objective briefing screens; they did a nice job on those.  This is definitely different than the typical first person shooter game or real-time strategy game.  It does take a little getting use to, but once you get the hang of it, it's really fun!  Even for an "older" game, I thought the sound and graphics were great!
