 I used this pump along with a dehumidifier.  The dehumidifier drained water into the pump; the pump carried the water outside via tubing, which I purchased at a hardware store.  The pump only turns-on when the water reaches a certain level.  I thought it was quiet and it was reliable.  I used it for about 2 months.  I no longer need the dehumidifier, so now I am trying to sell the pump.  If I had to purchase a pump again, I would purchase this brand.
