 I received this game as a gift, knowning that it was an older game (one of the classic FPS).  It met my expectations and was fun to play.  I didn't notice any bugs; the game came with the latest patch.  The graphics were good.  It does have monsters and stuff, but not too unrealistic.  It did make me jump a couple of times, and that's always fun.  And if you wait long enough, you came but fun games like this at a reduced price!
