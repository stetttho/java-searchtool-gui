 This is a cheesy porn flick.  The basic story is a guy who pretends to be nerdy falls "in love" with a cool guy who is surrounded by other cool friends.  The cool guy takes pity on the nerdy guy and ends-up having sex with him.  Very bad "acting".  No dialog.  The main character just talks us through the "movie" as he relives his experience.  Don't waste your time or money.
