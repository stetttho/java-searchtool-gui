 I enjoyed this movie.  It had many funny parts.  I also liked the way it tracked the lives of the two men over a period of several years.  The ending was sad, and typical for a gay movie.  That was my only disappointment.  However, I am glad that I bought it and I'll be watching it again in the near future.
