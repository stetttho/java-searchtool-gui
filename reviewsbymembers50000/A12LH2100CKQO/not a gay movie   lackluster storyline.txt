 I was disappointed in this movie and have rated it "1 star" in order to help balance the folks who gave it "5 stars".    It's about a boy whose family dies one-by-one while he was young. He meets another boy and they experiment with each other (nothing graphic).  Then they go their separate ways and grow-up.  They reunite, but one is straight and the other is a closeted gay guy who has a female housemate.  The straight guy and gay guy are best friends.  The straight guy has a baby with the female housemate and they all move to the countryside.  After a few years, the female moves back to the city with the baby, leaving the two guys living together in the countryside in a house she bought.  Aside from the brief experimentation scenes when the boys were young, there is no sexual contact between the two men during the movie.  They're just best friends. And there's nothing wrong with that, but this should not be advertised as a gay movie, because it isn't.
