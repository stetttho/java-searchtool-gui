 The following review was sent to the Anti-m.com web site. We were given permission to use it here.  Predominantly a synths-based album, it features                                  the odd song, short link narrative tracks, the                                  occasional electric and electrifying guitar solos,                                  spooky voices buried in the depths, some mighty                                  flowing lead synth lines from the three musicians                                  and a staggering 21 tracks in sixty-eight minutes.                                  The mood of the album is pretty varied from intense                                  multi-synth darkwave flows of warming music through                                  more delicate refrains from guitar and the massive                                  synthbank that surrounds and envelops the mix,                                  to the D.Mode style                                  songs, on one of the strangest albums I've heard                                  in ages. Like it? I'll tell you in three or four                                  plays time.maybe. Andy Garibaldi (Dead Earnest)
