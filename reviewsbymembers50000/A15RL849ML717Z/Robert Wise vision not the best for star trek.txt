 Ok, I have to say that I approve of directors cuts. This dvd is loaded with deleted scenes and finalized special fx that the director didn't get to finish the first time around. However I first must say that this movie bored me the first time in 1979 and it bores me now. Star trek isnt about watching 30 minutes of special fx of Vger. Its about the relationships of Kirk, Spock and the rest of the  crew. I personally prefer the versions of this movie with the extra dialog scenes added back in. Vger drags on and on. I'm one of the few that would rather watch star trek 5. Now the directors cut of trek II rocks.
