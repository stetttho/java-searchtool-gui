 After years, nearly 20, kansas finally gets back together in its classic lineup to do SOMEWHERE TO ELSEWHERE (completely written by Kerry Livgren) which happens to be the best thing they have done in a long time. But something happened around the same time. Vocalist Steve Walsh releases, I believe, his second solo effort....and it's a wonderful, experimental, emotional, progressive work. I don't want to go one for ever here so I will just say if you have been disappointed with Kansas over the past few years, you shouldn't be with this. I say but it. It's great, I've been playing it a lot.
