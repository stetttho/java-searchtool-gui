 It is a given that this is a very low budget film. But I was at the theatrical release of this film. It was a theater of around 200 people and there were people standing in the isles to see it. Some, I'm sure, were simply friends of the film makers, others had no idea what they were about to see. What I can say is that everyone I could see (and hear) was laughing. Not quietly to themselves but loudly. Sure some of the jokes are so stupid you may roll your eyes at them but there is a core of BOND jokes that prove the film makers watched a lot of James Bond.  The acting is goofy and or silly and the special effects are minimal. I have not seen it available to rent anywhere so if you want to see it you may have to buy it. It probably doesn't deserve the 4 stars I am giving it but it also doesn't deserve the 1 star ratings others have given it so I have done this to help the films rating.
