 Personally this album is a little mellow for my tastes. I like albums like THE DREAMING. Not that it isn't good. It is a good Kate cd and there are plenty of good reviews here to tell you that. My complaint is the packaging (the reason I give it 3 stars). Not only is it DIGI PAK which I hate, but it's the worst kind. The kind where you have to slide the disc in and out, potentially scratching the surface. I like the Jewel box. If you are thinking you might buy a UK import to get a jewel box, don't bother, unlike the Robert Plant CD (Mighty Rearranger) which was in a jewel box in the UK and a Digi pak here in the US Kates disc is the same in both countrys. While I know there are a lot of people who like these things I just say in 10 years when your cd packaging is worn out and your disc is scratched, remember that Jewel boxes were made to last a lot longer.
