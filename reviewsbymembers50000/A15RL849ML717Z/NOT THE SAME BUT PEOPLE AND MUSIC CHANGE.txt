 OK, I give it 5 stars because people are unfair. Gamma never sounded like Montrose, and Speed of sound didn't sound like Gamma, and...need I go on. People change and so does the music. So if you want it all to stay the same then go back and live in the 70's with your bell bottoms. This album is good. It's not my favorite. I like Gamma 3 the most. I really Love speed of sound too. Give it a chance, or not, or listen to it on Itunes.
