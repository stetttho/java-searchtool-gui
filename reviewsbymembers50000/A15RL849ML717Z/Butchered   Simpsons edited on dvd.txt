 Sadly I give this dvd one star because it is Edited. The season is great but they should have to print this information on the DVD. In BART THE DAREDEVIL Homer accidentily jumps the Gorge and falls and gets hit by the skateboard. Then when the ambulance hits a tree he falls again. On the dvd you just hear a scream and a lot of Doh's. On tv, depending on the channel, you usually get to see Homer banging his head, saying doh and there is blood. I assume this is edited for political correctness.
