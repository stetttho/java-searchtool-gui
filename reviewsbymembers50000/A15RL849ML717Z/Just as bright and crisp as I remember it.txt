 Another cd in the long list of remasters completed in the Saga catalog. This one comes with the bonus track of the Extended version of Catwalk. The remastering is very bright and crisp and peircing on the high end, just like the original Rupert Hine production of this album. I love this album. Great tracks like THE FLYER, INTERMISSION, and the incredible PITCHMAN. This is the period where Saga blended pop with progressive and it worked very well. I like this one much better than it follow up BEHAVIOUR. I don't like the square black box the keep putting on the cover art on the remasters. Basically it is a black border and it is not necessary. Jethro tull  did it on the first three remasters and then the next three had not border, I think people were unhappy. This was a period when everything rupert hine produced was right up my alley. The Fixx, Chris Deburgh, Howard Jones, Camel, Rush etc. Its a good one.
