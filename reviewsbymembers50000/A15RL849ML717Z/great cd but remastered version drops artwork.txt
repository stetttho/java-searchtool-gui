 One of the most surprising  grand efforts by saga in the 90s. This is the remastered version, sounds great but the  art that was on the original cd, gone. Some of the cool photos from the original .....gone. So my only reason for 4 stars, they were cheap on the artwork. I guess they dont care about the fans.
