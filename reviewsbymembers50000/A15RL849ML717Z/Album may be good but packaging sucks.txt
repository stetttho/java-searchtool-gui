 This album might be as good as the other reviews. I have not opened my copy. Why? Because I didn't know it came in a mini sleeve. And it's such a thin one that it would vanish in my cd cabinet. I have no problem with lp replicas, but give us the option. Offer these things in both the mini sleve, or digi pak and in jewel box. I still have jewel boxes from 1984. but all the digi paks I have from that early have deteriorated. I am checking in the UK and Canada for a jewel box version.
