 This is one of the great solo albums of the 70's. Pete shows his talents after leaving genesis. However I purchased the 2002 remaster and then later saw this (wrongfully listed for a while as hybrid) on amazon. So since I have high end gear and sacd compatability I gave it a shot. Personally, it sounds exactly the same as the remaster. So buy whichever one you want. But don't get this one becuase of sacd. So my 4 stars is only because it didn't sound any different. But it is a great album.
