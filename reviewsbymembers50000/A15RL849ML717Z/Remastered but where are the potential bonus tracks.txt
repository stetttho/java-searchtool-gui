 I have purchased all the remastered cds in the Saga catalog so far and am reviewing all. I decided to pass on IN TRANSIT as it was a very short live album. Security of Illusion is a great album for Saga. Better than Wildest Dreams, Behavior and Throwing Shapes (not that they are bad, I own them all).  The Remastering is good, but the original was good. You get the acoustic version of Security of Illusion as a bonus track but so far no saga cd has included as a bonus track GOTTA LOVE IT, SOLSBURY HILL, or WALKING ON THIN ICE. It will be a crime if the last few remasters don't include these songs. The inner art is great but whoever does the art for the cover is a slacker, they put a square black box around the cover art. I work with art and there is no excuse for this. My vote...Great album, if you don't need the acoustic version of Security of Illusion, then pass, but if you don't own this one, get it now!!
