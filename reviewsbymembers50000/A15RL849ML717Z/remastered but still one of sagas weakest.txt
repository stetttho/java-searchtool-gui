 OK, not the best saga album but it is remastered and has a bonus track live. however my version has the lyrics and this one doesn't, and they say all the remasters are restoring artwork. does this only work on the old albums?? Either way I like about half the album so 3 stars. generation 13 and full circle are better releases over the last few years. however they are remastering all of the catalog so dont miss the classics. and (they're not listed) as remastered so look for a 2002 release date.
