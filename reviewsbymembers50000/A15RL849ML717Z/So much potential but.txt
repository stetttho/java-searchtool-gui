 I first have to say I loved the babylon 5 series and most of the B5 Movies. The casting for this show is a real mixed bag. Gary Cole as Captain Gideon? He did a decent job of it but I felt he was playing the role too close to the annoying boss in OFFICE SPACE but it is nice to see he can mix it up. After all he was great in those Brady Bunch Movies. Daniel Kim, Peter Woodward and Carrie Dobro all play their roles very well. The doctor played by Marjean Holden has very little performance in the show, David Allen Brooks Character is so so and Tracy Scoggins, reprising her role from B5, is out of place. Not to mention she is listed as starring and is only in 3 episodes. The writing is interesting and the direction is by some B5 Veterans including episodes Directed by Stephen Furst (Vir). With all that said it is still very watchable if you are a B5 fan. But the worst thing in this series is the music. Evan H. Chen's style just isn't for this show. I frequently felt the music would kill an episode. So if you are not a B5 fan this isn't for you. If you are a B5 fan watch for inconsistencies. Oh, and I only saw one of these episodes when it aired, so I had to check it out on dvd. I'm sure some of you will love it, personally I'll watch FARSCAPE or the original B5 shows.
