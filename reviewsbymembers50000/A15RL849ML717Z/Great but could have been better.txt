 As part of the saga remaster series, softworks is remastered by steve negus and is mostly a cd rom interactive. However the songs THE CALL and PERFECT STRANGER which are not on saga albums are here and playable in a cd player. The disc is cool but why not include songs like GOTTA LOVE IT or their version of SOLSBURY HILL released around the same time as THE CALL. So this is cool but could have been better. Dont miss other sage remasters. if it says 2002 or later its a remaster under the bands supervision.
