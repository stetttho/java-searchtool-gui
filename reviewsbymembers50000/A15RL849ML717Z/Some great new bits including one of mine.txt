 I wanted to say that I used to go to the Spike and Mike festivals every year when they came to my town. Little did I know that one day I would be featured in them . So all i ask is that you give this video a chance and check out CHESSMASTER THEATRE, that's mine. And if you like it then search for YOU ONLY DIE ONCE on amazon in dvd and video for my feature length James Bond Spoof. It's cheap and worth a few laughs.
