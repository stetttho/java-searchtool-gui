 At first Listen I was really disappointed. As I continued to listen my feelings didnt change. I love Choirgirl, Venus, Earthquakes and Under the pink. I even love so many of the singles and covers she has done but this album was just to out there. However, Happiness is a warm gun is great. A very unique treatment. Perhaps my disappointment with this album was that I was not really ever a fan of most of the music she covered in the first place. But then I love depeche mode and didn't like that song either. You know, if you worship tori you'll like it. I beleive everyone can have a bad one or two and this and boys for pele are her two
