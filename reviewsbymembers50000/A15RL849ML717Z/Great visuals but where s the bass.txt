 Some YES fans will worship anything they do. I admit I love yes but I hate  it when they put out something that looks great, is of a great performance  and someone who didn't know YES mixed it. The bass is lacking on this  DVD/Video. In addition, when they are showing Steve Howe play some of his  best bits, you can't here him, or at least he is mixed way back. Its about  as poor a mix as the DVD of ABWH. Lets hope the CD will sound better. But  if you like yes you will like the visuals.
