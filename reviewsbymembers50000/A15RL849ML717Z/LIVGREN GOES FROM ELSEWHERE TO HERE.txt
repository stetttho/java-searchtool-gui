 I like all the Kansas albums that feature STEVE WALSH.  I also  love the Steve Walsh album GLOSSALALIA (if you don't have it you should get it). However, I have never been a fan of the solo work of Kerry Livgren. While with Kansas his writing was some of the best I just couldn't get into the solo albums. However, after the reunion album of the original Kansas lineup on Somewhere to Elsewhere, with Livgren writting all the music, I was again a fan. So I took a chance on this album. WAIT OF GLORY is a good album with strong songs. It reminds me a bit of Spocks Beard, perhaps that is the "spiritual element" of the lyrics. There is some Kansas like music as well and a bit of early King Crimson like stuff. Yet it doesn't sound dated either.   So I would say if you like Somewhere to Elsewhere by Kansas you would like this. If you like spocks beard, though I have only heard one of their albums, I bet you would like this too. My TWO CENTS WORTH.
