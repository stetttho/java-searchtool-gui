 The first time that I heard Ronnie Montrose was on Gamma 3. In fact at the time I didn't even know about the band MONTROSE. Gamma 3 was a nice mix of hard rock and that synthesized sound that was about to emerge in the 80's. On of the songs I always loved on Gamma 3 was CONDITION YELLOW, an instrumental. The song CATSCAN featured here on Territory has that same kind of sound. The rest of the album is a mixture of experiments by Ronnie trying different things. Some songs are very odd (I SPY) and some of the  songs are very beautiful (synesthesia-women of Ireland). Not one of Ronnies best but there are enough good tracks to make it worth a listen.  If you like songs like CATSCAN and CONDITION YELLOW then you should love Ronnies album SPEED OF SOUND and the work he did with ANTI-M on POSITIVELY NEGATIVE. If you are looking for Rock Candy and Bad Motor Scooter then this album isn't for you. I like it, I own it, I listen to it and this REMASTERED VERSION is pretty good.
