 The music is a mellower Gilmour. I like the music, it is fine. My complaint is how many cds are now coming in a variety of packages. This does not come in a jewel box (which I like) or a digi pak (which I hate) it comes in a little book with the most bizarre ring for the disc to go on. Sure the artsy people will love it but I like consistency. Make the "special" stuff for special editions and just give me the jewel box. This book will wear, the cd ring will fall apart if handled too much. I am already having trouble with it.   I was equally upset over the Kate Bush release of 2005 and the Robert Plant (which fortunately I found in the UK in a jewel).  Just had to vent, Enjoy
