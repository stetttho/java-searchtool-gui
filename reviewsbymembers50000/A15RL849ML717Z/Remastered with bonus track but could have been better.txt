 The saga remastering was a long time in coming. This album sounds great and while not as good as Heads or Tales, Worlds Apart or the epic GENERATION 13 it is still a good saga album. The bonus on this remastered version is the live version of MISBEHAVIOUR. Sadly the artwork looked better on my polygram version but that one didn't have the lyrics and this does. SO there are some plus' and minus' to this Saga release. You be the judge.
