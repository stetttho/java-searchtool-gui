 Ok Saga Fans, the remaster of this album is definately better than the polygram version I had which also had no lyrics or liner notes or band photos. All the photos are nice and I like this remaster a lot. Problem is that my cover art on my Polygram version has more color and detail. So who got lazy in the art dept. Its not sharp and the color is really flat. Other than that this is a good album. Not my favorite saga album, they were still getting better at this point. Good outing and good remaster.
