 One of the most creative instrumental guitar albums  I have heard. One of Ronnie's best. I was  a big fan of the Gamma albums featuring Ronnie, and my favorite was Gamma 3. Though this is instrumental and Gamma has vocals both are classic. I also recommend Territory (though it is not as strong of an album) The Diva Station (currently out of print) and Anti-m Positively Negative -remastered (Ronnie plays on a handful of tracks but the song Security rocks). And visit Ronnies Website RonnieMontrose.com and get on his email list.
