 I was at this show in SLO Town. I am not aware, as the other review states, of any other musicians or vocalists off stage. I admit the visuals are kind of weak but the performance and mix blow away the house of yes show. I felt the house of yes dvd had good visuals but had no bass in the mix and kept losing Howe. I feel this is a good buy, I have the laser disc and plan to get this dvd as well.
