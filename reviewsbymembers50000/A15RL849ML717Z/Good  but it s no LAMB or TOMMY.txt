 I have heard of Spocks Beard for years but never heard them.  Just having the name SPOCK in the title interested me as I am a trek fan but that is besides the point. I bought this album because it was compared to THE LAMB LIES DOWN ON BROADWAY and TOMMY. Progressive it is, the LAMB or TOMMY it is not. This is a good solid band but this album, or double cd, lacks some of what I really love. Feeling. Oh I am sure they put feeling into the work but I don't feel it. I can listen to RUSH, PINK FLOYD, YES, GENESIS, KING CRIMSON, KANSAS etc and these are the bands I hear BEARD compared to. But they are missing something. The musicianship is great and the cd reminds me of KANSAS quite a bit but I personally think that STEVE WALSH (KANSAS VOCALIST) recent solo effort GLOSSALALIA is far more progressive and has substantially more feeling than this effort.  Am I sad I bought it???? No, I like it. But I may not buy another one unless I hear it first.
