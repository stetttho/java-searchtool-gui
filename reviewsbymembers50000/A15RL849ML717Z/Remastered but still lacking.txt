 saga is remastering their entire collection. So far the first three saga releases sound great and have all the art restored. Steel umbrellas however is not one of my favorites. To add to this I own a polydor and a Bonaire version of this cd. The bonaire version has a song called WALKING ON THIN ICE and its better than most on the disc. Considering saga is adding bonus tracks why didnt they add this song instead of I WALK WITH YOU LIVE.I also own NEVER ALONE and WHY NOT as sinle edits on a best of, why no bonus tracks of these, the space is there. So it seems the remasters are like the SAGA WEBSITE never quite complete and always leaving you wishing there had been more. My comment on this one, skip it if you already own it.
