 The feel and performance on this disc is impressive. the band is focused, dark, angry and ready to take on the music of bands like Metallica and white zombie. A great mix of Metal, Techno, and industrial. Dark and Angry music with a lot of feeling. If you like metal or industrail. Machines are for you. Check out CONCENTRATION as well.
