 It's not often that I read Sci Fi. In fact it's not often I read very much at all these days. However it's nice when you get a chance to read something of quality with a varity of interesting characters that you feel you have known all of your life. Just as Babylon 5 pulled me in to the TV this book will pull you into its pages. You won't want to put it down until it's done and then....you will wish there was more.
