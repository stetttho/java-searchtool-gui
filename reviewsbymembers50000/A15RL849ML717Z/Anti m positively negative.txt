 This review was sent to the anti-m.com web site and we were given permission to post it here  Three years on and we find our heroes back in the                                studio, this time toning down the quirky sense of                                humour, and going for a more sensible seventeen                                tracks and keeping the narrative out of the window                                altogether. So, it starts off with a song that bizarrely                                mixes D.Mode style                                synths, drums and vocals with a biting electric                                guitar lead courtesy of none other than Ronnie                                Montrose, who also contributes some stirring                                guitar work on three further tracks, while guitarist                                Steve Weber, whose influences I am reliably informed                                are Fripp/Holdsworth,                                contributes electric guitar to most of the other                                tracks, while the main duo behind the band remain                                as Ruston Slager on lead vocals and keyboards, with                                John Wardlaw on keyboards, lead vocals and guitar.                                With six instrumental and eleven songs, it's a strange                                mix of music that mixes the likes of Human                                League/D.Mode/Heaven 17styles with some                                hot electric guitar work in there too, giving it                                quite a unique feel, and if you're into that style                                and era of songs, only with less pop, more atmosphere                                and overall stronger instrumentally, then this is                                for you, for sure.
