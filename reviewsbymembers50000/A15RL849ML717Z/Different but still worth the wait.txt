 Anyone who expects a band to sound the same after almost 20 years is crazy. Ronnie and the band have changed with time and while this album does not rock as hard as 1,2 and 3 it still has some great playing and vocals. LAST MAN ON EARTH is a great track. Denny Davey and Glenn sound great. Ronnie is always good. The album has a more blues feeling than the old hard rock sound. I don't agree with the other review on this site that said it was a waste of money. Some people want every thing to stay the same. I say support the artist is you like them and by doing that you try the album and see if you like it.
