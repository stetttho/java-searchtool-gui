 Ok, If you are a Mechanics fan then I respect your love of the band but they don't do it for me. This album is very good and I give it 5 stars for a solo outing. If it were a genesis album then it would get 3 or 4. If you like AND THEN THERE WERE THREE and DUKE you should like this. Very acoustic though. I like this and the first mechanics album. Didn't like Mikes follow up to this, ACTING VERY STRANGE.  I also like Banks album A CURIOUS FEELING. Each members solo effort was very good. That applies to Gabriel, Collins, Phillips, Hackett, Banks and Rutherford. Enjoy
