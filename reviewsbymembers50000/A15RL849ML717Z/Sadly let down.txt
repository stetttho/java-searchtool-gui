 The first conspiracy album was better, and the songs that squire and sherwood wrote that ended up on OPEN YOUR EYES were even better than that. Sure, with squire and sherwood you will find some good playing but the album lacks feeling. Obviously other reviews show that opinions are just that. It is all subjective. I have every yes album and a handful of solo albums, FISH OUT OF WATER is wonderful, Rabin's CAN'T LOOK AWAY is very good as well. Anderson's OLIAS is beautiful. This cd just lacks feeling. I feel bad giving this a poor review but I am being honest.
