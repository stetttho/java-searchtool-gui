 I CAN SEE  YOUR HOUSE FROM HERE is not Camel's best album. Some of the songs are too pop for camel. The playing is, as always, excellent but some of the songs are lacking. However, this album has 10 minute instrumental,  ICE, that makes the whole thing worth owning. Other good songs include HYMN  TO HER and EYE OF THE STORM.
