 This book was written by Michael Jackson's PR people. The poor kid who was abused by Michael jackson named Jordie whom at 13 had the courage to come forward and tell his story of what the sick king of pop now joke of pop! One of the hardest things for any child to do is to Tell when this type of thing happens to them. The guilty party indeed Michael Jackson and his blind fans. I think we all owe Raymond Chandler a big thank you for writing the great classic book All That Glitters and having b*lls to have his book released after a similar book was banned by Michael Jackson, the king of child abusers, to keep the real story from coming out. If we had taken this piece of trash to prison in 1993 then the trial in 2005 wouldn't have happened and several kids would've been saved from this disgrace to music who thinks he is (...) Peter Pan when in fact he is an aging geezer. Michael Jackson and his blind fans, including Totally P***ed Off, should grow the **** up and listen to the cries of little children, their tears are real while Michael's are fake!
