 We realized our son needed a walker when he started pushing the kitchen chairs around all over the house.  There are several in the stores to choose from, but we decided on this one because I liked that he would be able to ride it once he got older.  As a push toy, it's been fabulous.  That base it wide enough so that it did not tip over easily, and it's easy for him to manuever.  It's been 8 months, and he's walking terrifically on his own now but he still pushes this things around every day, and it still looks like it did the day we bought it.  It's such a favorite that we take it with us when we travel.  Now that he's older, though, I thought that he would want to ride it, but he doesn't.  He's such a big boy, that he really can't ride on it comfortably anyway, but even if he could, when he sees it collapsed, he just tries to turn it up on its nose so he can push it like he's used to.  So we keep it in the upright position all the time, but he still loves it.  It's a good buy.
