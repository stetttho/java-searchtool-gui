 I bought this toy for my three month old after reading positive reviews of it.  I am so glad I did because it is worth every single penny.  When I put my son in his crib every night, I turn this on and it keeps him asleep.  If he does happen to open his eyes, he will stare at the lights and listen to the soft sounds until he drifts back to sleep.  Now that he can shoot his legs straight up in the air and roll around, he will "accidentally" turn it on in the mornings when he wakes up by hitting the big red button with his feet.  It has a volume control, which is wonderful, and we've had it for over five months and only changed the batteries twice.  I've never used the nature sounds feature, just the music, but maybe when he gets older he'll enjoy switching back and forth.  I also very rarely use the remote that comes with it because it's just as easy to go and turn it on manually.  I would definitely recommend this toy for anyone with a baby.
