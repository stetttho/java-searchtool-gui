 I made the mistake of walking by this mower display in Toys R Us with my 15 month old son.  The bright colors caught his attention (ours is the red, black, and yellow version) and when I didn't let him stop to play he threw a fit.  Thinking that I'd let him play with it for a few minutes and then be on my way, I went back to the aisle, lifted him out of the buggy, and let him "mow" a few aisles.  When I thought it was time to stop, I put him back into the buggy and put the mower back on the display, and he had a cataclysmic breakdown.  I had never seen him so attached so quickly to a toy.  Needless to say, I put the mower in the buggy with him, and it went home with us.  He has played with it every day since, and it is by far his favorite toy.  He keeps our hall, living room, dining room and kitchen mowed to perfection.  And I don't mind this toy because the popping sound is not so loud and annoying that I want to take it away after a while.  Anything that makes him so happy makes me happy.
