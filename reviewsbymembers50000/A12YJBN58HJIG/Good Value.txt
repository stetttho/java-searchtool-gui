 I am a huge fan of toys that do not have pieces.  I am very tired of picking up little plastic pieces.  I used a gift certificate to buy this toy, and I have been extremely pleased with it.  My son can pick it up by its little carrying handle and tote it around the house.  Of course, it gets dropped a lot, but it's so durable that it's not even an issue.  He really doesn't like to play with this by himself for very long, but since it contains an entire octave, I can tap out basic little tunes for him, sing along with it, and he claps his hands and laughs to see mommy trying to be a musician.  It keeps both of us occupied.  I am glad I bought this one rather than the smaller baby version.  If you can have twice the keys for just a little more money (I think it was a [price] difference), I don't see any reason not to get the bigger version.  It is a good toy.
