 OK, so it took us about 10 minutes to decide to take the batteries out, but once we did that we had a terrific toy.  My 8 month old got this for Christmas, and now he's 15 months old and he still plays with it all the time (sans batteries).  At first, I would stack the pieces for him and he would knock them all down.  Then, he figured out how to empty the pail so I would put them all in and he would take them all out.  Now he just turns the pail upside down, dumps them all out, scatters them all over the floor, and then gathers them all up and puts them back in to do it again.  He loves to stack them, and while he stacks them I call the colors out to him.  He also knows which shapes go into which holes, but he doesn't have the precise dexterity yet to get them to go in; he always tries to put them in at an angle and you have to get them dead on.  All in all, it's a great toy and I'm glad we got it.
