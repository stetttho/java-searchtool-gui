 My 15 month old hates being confined in his stroller.  I wanted a wagon, but my husband thought it would be too frivilous a purchase.  I drug him to the store to look at them anyway, and he reluctantly agreed to get one.  Originally, I had in my mind to get one of the Little Tykes wagons.  I didn't even know that Radio Flyer made a plastic wagon.  When I saw this one, I fell instantly in love with it.  I thought I wanted doors on my wagon, but I love that it doesn't have any.  I would rather have the space of a full wagon than have one whose space is taken up with little plastic seats.  The sides are tall enough that it discourages our son from bailing out.  Rather, he sits in it and wants to ride and ride and ride.  It has a nice storage bin underneath that you access from a small door inside the wagon.  It also comes apart very easy for travel.  After several weeks of serious use, my hubby even admitted that this was one of the best big ticket purchases we've made for our son.
