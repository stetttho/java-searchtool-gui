 This was a Christmas present that never made it under the tree because my son discovered it and he wouldn't part with it long enough for me to wrap it.  He totes it around all over the place.  I have to admit, I had a little trouble with giving him a chainsaw.  He thinks it's funny to crank 'er up and pretend to saw on daddy's arms and legs (in part because daddy screams and flails about as if he were losing his appendanges, much to the chagrin of mommy) but didn't all well-adjusted, productive members of society have childhoods filled with pretend carnage?  (Think Looney Tunes and cap guns.)  As for the chainsaw, it's noisy, for sure, but so much fun it stands out as a favorite.
