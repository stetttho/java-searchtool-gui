 I bought this set for my 2 year old son because he loves tools, and this set seemed to contain a lot for the money.  I took the smaller pieces out of the set from the beginning, because I felt these were not age appropriate (it does say three and up on the box).  The hammer is really sturdy for a plastic toy, and I am very pleased with it.  It's so sturdy, I have to be careful my son doesn't knock on the wall or furniture too hard.  The little handsaw is cute and sturdy, too.  The tape measure is his favorite, and one of mine as well.  The c-clamp and calipers are also a lot of fun.  I have a few complaints about the other tools, though.  The drill is hollow and flimsy, and the bits will not stay in.  The adjustable pliers were also flismy and were bent and broken in half within 10 minutes.  The red grips on the needle-nosed pliers will also not stay on, and while they aren't a choking hazard or anything, it's still frustrating to have to constantly put them back on.  If this kit had come without these things, as well as the little nails, nuts, and bolts, and the fake pieces of wood (which are pretty useless) I would have liked this kit much better.  It's still worth the money, just be prepared to deal with the junk thrown in with the good stuff.
