 When I started bottle feeding my baby, I tried countless types of name brand bottles that I had received as gifts.  Feeding time became a hassle because the milk cam out too fast in all the kinds I tried, not to mention that the nipples were very different than what he was used to by breast feeding.  I broke down and spent the money on the Avent system, and it's the best baby purchase I've ever made.  The bottles hold up well in washing, and so do the nipples.  I have had no tearing problems.  They did leak on me at first, but when I investigated and found I was screwing the cap too tight, I corrected it and the problem vanished.  I do not know if it really causes that much less air, because I have not used other brands for a long period of time.  Avent is the best system you can use for your baby.  My only complaint is that the larger bottles only come with newborn sized nipples and after the first few months you don't need that size anymore.  I would like to buy my bottles with the size nipple that I need, rather than having to buy the bottles that come with useless nipples and then having to buy several packs of nipples.  But that's a small price to pay for superior quality.
