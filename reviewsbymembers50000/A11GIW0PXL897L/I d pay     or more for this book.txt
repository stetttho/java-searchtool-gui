 This book is WELL WORTH the money!! If it was $50, I'd pay it!! After trying so many "egg-free" recipes off the internet that totally flopped and wasted my time and ingredients, I was so elated when I came across this book at a local bookstore.  My husband, who is highly allergic to eggs, never could have any tasty baked goods.  The best thing about Emro's recipes is that the baked goods actually taste good and 85% of the recipes are simple to make!   The baked goods I've made from this book are indistinguishable from your regular, quality baking with eggs!  I prefer this egg-free recipe book over many of my bakery books that have eggs!  I HIGHLY suggest buying this book!  I've made wonderful cookies, cupcakes, cakes, shortcake, and more!  I haven't even skimmed the surface of this book's potential and I would have paid $50 for the recipes thus far!   (Helpful hint: on occasion the batter may get a titch dry because of the lack of eggs, she generally replaces eggs with oil, etc, sometimes it is necessary to add a teaspoon or two of water, sometimes she will even say so).  Use common sense with this cookbook.  My husband has never been happier.  He can finally partake of treats on the hoildays or just for fun!   Just tried the eggless cheesecake and it was wonderful.  I was amazed I made it and it turned out so close to regular cheesecake, if not better.  Absolutely wonderful recipes! GREAT JOB ROSEMARIE EMRO!  This is the best cookbook I have ever owned and will ever own!  I'd DEFINITELY suggest this book to a friend, even one who could eat eggs!  BUY IT NOW!
