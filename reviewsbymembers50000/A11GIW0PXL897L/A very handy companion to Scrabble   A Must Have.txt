 If you love Scrabble, you have to try out this Scrabble electronic dictionary.  It's wonderful....it makes playing the game much easier.  Even a tabbed (book) dictionary isn't as good as this - just type in the word - press enter - you instantly see if it's a word or not, and if so, it'll define it.  If it takes forever to tell you - that means it's not a word and it's finding the nearest word to your entry.  There's some games and extras on it, but it does the job wonderfully!!  I didn't pay retail, I got it on sale which I'm sure I'll never see again, but it's worth it even at retail price!  Very easy to use and your friends and family will thank you for it!  It definitely saves time during the game!!
