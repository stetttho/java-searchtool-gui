 I just got this wonderful BBQ set today - I am simply amazed at the quality & abundance of utensils for the money [$$$]  I could seriously see this set in [stores], etc for over [$$$] + tax!  I got it for [$$$]...  This BBQ set looks very expensive and would make a wonderful gift for your family or a friend!  The first thing I thought when I got this set was "WOW, this set is gigantic and looks expensive!", each utensil is extra large and solid and the case is huge.  The quality looks great!  The handles look like redwood and they appear very sturdy like they'd last for years and years, which is what I and most of you need!  There's even an oven mit included!  Also, the corn holders are not cheapie plastic like in the store - they're real wood!  Don't go out to the store and buy one tool for [$$$] or more....definitely buy this set- you won't regret it!  I am BBQ'n tonight!!  On a side note, we are a one income family and every dollar counts - that's why I went with this set after searching on Amazon.com - and honestly, it does NOT look like a cheap [$$$] set....this set is QUALITY!!  Good luck w/your purchase; it's a MUST have for summer!  :-)  Enjoy!
