 My husband & I bought our first single family home recently and redid the kitchen, bathroom, and master bedroom inexpensively but dramatically.  Most recently was the bedroom.  We bought this set and thought it would go wonderfully with our palm tree/bamboo/exotic/tropical feel of the room.  It did!  We painted the walls a light muted yellow, trim was white, and once this bedding set was assmebled, it was so stunning!!  Great price too - way less than retail Target!    The comforter is nice, it is slightly thinner than your typical bed in bag comforter, but I like that because getting too hot at night is unpleasant.  The sheets are 300 tread count, they're very smooth, and simply GORGEOUS! I can't believe they give you the bedskirt, 2 Euro shams, 2 regular pillowcases, flat, fitted, comforter, etc for a perfect price.  These are nice shams!  Usually shams I see are $19.99 each!  It's a super deal and the design is beautiful.  EXACTLY like the pictures!  We are very happy with this purchase through Amazon.  There are some junky bed-in-bag sets out there (even at top name stores!) and this is NOT one of them.  It's superb! Ship weight was 30 lbs, free ship, and came in a thick clear packaging with blue corded handles, quite attractive! Enjoy!
