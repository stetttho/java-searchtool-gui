 C'mon people- this is a very fun game.  Don't give it bad reviews because you're upset it wasn't for sale when you wanted.  I just picked up this game tonight and it's as fun as the original SNES version!  It looks exactly the same, and I don't see any differences.  It plays very well on the GBA and I'm having a blast re-living it!  I always loved playing Aladdin, the backgrounds are fun, the controls are easy, and it's enjoyable!  It's actually $24.99 at Toys R Us, so don't pay more than that.    You'll have many fun hours with this game....enjoy!
