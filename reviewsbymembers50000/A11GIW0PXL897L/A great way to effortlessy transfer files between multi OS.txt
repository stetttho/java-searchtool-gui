 I never thought this Jumpdrive would be so cool to own! I am glad I finally own one! Not only is it a great backup (OUTSIDE of the computer), it's a perfect way to take files with you on the road, bring files or images to a friend's house, work, etc, or transfer images in the SAME ROOM!  How can you email 250MB?  It'd take forever.  I just put all the files/images on the drive, hand it over, and they have the files instantly.  It's an attractive storage device too.  I wouldn't pay $60-70 for this item, I got it on ebay for $39 brand new.  So far it looks durable, effective, & easy-to-use.  I'm happy!  No matter what OS you're in, it'll work fine.  I am using Win XP and put some images on the JumpDrive and handed it to my husband who uses Mandrake Linux and he plugged it in his USB port and the files showed up instantly.  No drivers, installation, or B.S.  JUST WORKED!    And this is USB 2.0 so it's fast.  Even copying files over in 1.1 mode was quick.  When I look at available space on the drive it says there's 245MB possible.  So the drivers took about 11MB of space.  No big deal, if I need every MB, I would have gotten the 512MB, but in my opinion this is a perfect amt. of storage for me, for now.    I've lost many files and images over the years (almost lost our wedding pictures, OMG!!), it won't happen again!!!  Thanks to this Jumpdrive, and my DVD/RW.    Enjoy!
