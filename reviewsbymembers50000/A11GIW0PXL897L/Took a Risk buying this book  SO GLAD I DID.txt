 Normally, I wouldn't think of buying this kind of book, but it's been a  GREAT addition to our bathroom; we love it!  What I love about this bathroom reader book is that all the passages are good, readible sizes, nothing's too long that you have to continue reading it in another sitting (ha-ha).  :-)  There are some informative sections and some funnies, and interesting quotes.  It's a sizeable book that contains many things you'd normally not hear about - the CIA and LSD experimentations (dates back to the Nazi's), people famous for being naked (pg. 157), and a quiz section about law, etc! You never know what the next page will reveal, it's always a surprise. I also enjoy the bottom of the pages that give you one line info tidbits such as "How can you tell when a kangaroo is nervous?  It licks its forearms.  Nobody knows why."  Interesting!  And...."20% of drivers get 80% of the traffic tickets".....and finally "60% of pets in Great Britain have some form of health insurance".  Great facts that you'd normally not read elsewhere.  This book has 500 pages, lots of reading, and we were surprised it's so interesting.  I will definitely buy another edition of this BRI (Bathroom Reader's Institute) Series.  Probably great to give as gifts (for fun).   Enjoy and remember like the book says "Go with the flow".
