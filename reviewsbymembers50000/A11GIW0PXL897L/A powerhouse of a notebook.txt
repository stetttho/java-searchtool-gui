 I recently ordered this item direct from Compaq (shipped from China but only took 2 days), build time was about a week. Since I ordered a custom built, I got the 2.2ghz (3400+) Athlon 64 chip, 1GB ram, 60gb, 15.4" (upgraded resolution to 1680 x 1050), upgraded 8 cell battery to 12 cell battery, upgraded to 4X DVD+R burner.     Pros:  - LIGHTENING FAST FOR A LAPTOP - fastest I've ever used or seen.  - Great photo editing - images resize immediately and you can load many photos at once (I upgraded to 1GB RAM which really helps).  - Very attractive notebook, silver inside and dark black/blue outside.   - Screen is wonderful, bright, and viewing angle is excellent.  -Burner is fast and hasn't let me down.   -Keyboard is full size and very comfortable.   -Power cable is on the back - why should I have to see it anyway?   -3 USB 2.0 allow for very high speed transfers. 2 USB on left, 1 on right.   - Boots up fast, easy to get out of hibernation.  -GREAT BATTERY LIFE. Best I've seen, especially compared to a Dell I barely got 1 hour out of! For such a speedy notebook, when you hibernate it, it really conserves. All night in hibernation, away from A/C, I think it went down only 8% or less!  -SOLID notebook, doesn't feel cheap or flimsy.   -Speaker controls are nicely placed on the right hand side of the notebook. CD-RW/DVD-R is on the left side.   -Trackpad's scroll area is convenient and easy to use. It's also nice you can turn off the trackpad so when you're typing you don't accidentally hit it.           CONS:  -Why doesn't the built in media slot have a compact flash slot - the most common type of media? It would have been very handy.  - I use an external mouse, but when I use the trackpad's buttons, they're noisy.  -It's a bigger notebook, you'll notice it's size/weight, but how do you expect to get a powerhouse without having a bigger notebook?   -No other complaints.    Overall, I'd rate it a 9.5/10. First the speed is going to amaze you, then compare to other manufacturers, and you'll be amazed the deal you got.    PS - one note - I got XP home preinstalled, I thought when I got the notebook I'd upgrade to XP Pro (I already have a copy). It won't let you, the drivers for XP Pro are not on the notebook. I called tech. support and they said your hard drive is corrupt now and you have to reinstall. Luckily, I didn't install anything important yet. There's no huge different between Home and XP (besides networking) and I really don't feel like giving Microsoft another $50 of my hard earned $. I just would have liked to know I couldn't install Pro later.     Don't compare this to an Athlon "XP" notebook, it's not the same. Athlon 64 is much faster than Athlon XP. This is the Athlon "64" chip, allowing for constant 64-bit processing. It blows P4 chips out of the water with "hyper threading", which isn't active ALL the time. The Athlon 64 bit chip is! This is the future of notebooks! Athlons have always been speedier than P4's for much less money! You won't be let down.    This powerhouse of a notebook is so fast I still can't get over it.    PS. #2 - don't buy the service plan in stores like Best buy or even Circuit city. If you do buy a notebook from those retail stores, call Compaq/HP up and ask for THEIR service plan. For $299 (less than Best Buy) you can get "3-year HP Accidental Damage Protection with Express Repair extended service plan   Protect your investment from all forms of accidental damage for 3 years!". That includes droppings, spills, falls, surges, collisions, etc. If I was going to waste money on a service plan, it definitely be Compaqs Accidental and EXPRESS REPAIR than stupid Best buy's rip off for $350 that doesn't cover the battery or anything accidentally. And I've heard horrible things about their repairs - takes forever, months, they're general idiots!    Buy from Compaq directly, you'll be happier!
