 I ordered this magazine for my husband, knowing it was up his alley, but had no idea I would like reading the magazine as well. I couldn't believe the latest edition with the prizes given to students/people who came up with great scientific ideas or products. Most were amazing, but a couple were eye-opening and made me think "why don't we have that already??" Plus this magazine had tidbits of electronics, many many ebay ads (haha, I love ebay too), and overall is quite interesting. Wonderful graphics that help you understand the scientific ideas. A great gift for an inquisitive person!!! A+++!!! Will reorder next year!
