 As I write this review, I am using the this Photo paper Plus I bought off Amazon.  It is just the perfect paper to compliment your Canon Printer.  Personally I have a Canon i860 (just got off Amazon) to replace an older Canon whose printhead died (S900).  Once I got my printer, I reprinted almost every photo I have!  And what paper did I use - none other than Canon's Photo Paper Plus 4X6 glossy.  It has never let me down - and I see absolutely no difference between the glossy and photo paper pro, so why not save $?    This paper is $11.99 + tax in every retail store I visit.  I can't believe Amazon can sell it this cheaply!  I picked up 4 packs because it's too good of a deal and I know I'll use every last piece of paper.    PROS: Wonderful prints - looks better than a photo lab in much less time!  Paper is nice and glossy, never had a defective piece.   Colors are true and vivid.   Great price vs. retail.  CONS: Packaging leaves much to be desired.  The outer carton is fine, but - I personally have ruined a few pieces of Canon paper because the adhesive they use to seal their plastic packages attaches to the paper and rips it apart - I carefully remove the plastic packaging and throw it away immediately.    BUY THIS PAPER!!!  It's wonderful and inexpensive!  Perfect for Canon printers!
