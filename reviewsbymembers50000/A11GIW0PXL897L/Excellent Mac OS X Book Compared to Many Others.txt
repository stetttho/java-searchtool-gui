 Well, initially I bought "Mac OS X Unleashed" and that was a mistake.  [Thisi is] for intermediate to advanced users,...I had to return it.  What I wanted was EXACTLY what this book "Mac OS X: The Missing Manual" offers!  This book is extremely complete and detailed.  If I was going to write a book about Mac OS X, this would be how I would have written it.  2 Thumbs up to David Pogue.  This book will sit beside my PowerMac G4 for all of eternity.  One thing I really wanted to learn about as a new Mac OS X user was aliases, what they are, how to use them, etc.  I figured it out by myself, but this book really made it clear to me.  Also, it explains in lamen's terms AppleScript and all the features of Mac OS X you haven't heard of!  This is the #1 Mac OS X book to buy if you're a new Mac user, or new to Mac OS X, or if you are intermediate.  If you're a Power User who knows everything there is to know so far, then get "Mac OS X: Unleashed".  If you're not that advanced, please consider this book!  IT'S EXCELLENT!!  Hope this review helped!!!  I love using MAC OS X and I hope you do too; get this book  - it'll show you many awesome things about Mac OS X!
