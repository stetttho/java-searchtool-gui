 This Matfer Exopat nonstick baking sheet was much nicer than expected.  Absolutely NOTHING sticks to this sheet, no scrubbing will ever be required, just a wet sponge to clean.  The cookies cooked quicker, were much easier than usual to remove from the pan, and the cookies tasted better.  It is much harder to burn your cookies with this sheet!  This sheet will pay for itself by not wasting expensive baking ingredients by accidentally burning cookies.  I've used it twice now and it's been a pleasure using it.  5 stars out of 5! It's a great addition to my baking collection & I will definitely recommend it to friends & family.   The only negative I can possible think of is storing this sheet because it's so flexible it can be a challenge to figure out how to store it - flat, rolled up, or tied.  All in all, it's a GREAT buy!  I will use it every time I bake cookies in the future!
