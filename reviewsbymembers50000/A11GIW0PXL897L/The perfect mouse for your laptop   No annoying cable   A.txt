 Got this mouse from Amazon today, it's perfect for my laptop or anyone's laptop!  Installed flawlessy on an older laptop, as with every Logitech mouse I've purchased, never had to use the installation CD.   Installation for this mouse couldn't be easier: take out of package, plug small receiver into USB slot, press connect button, load 2 batteries into mouse, press connect button, and it works instantly!  It even comes with a neoprene case for the mouse and receiver when you're travelling. Great form-factor, scroll works well, attractive medium silver mouse, and no annoying cable!  Haven't had "difficult to click" problems like other reviewers...no problems.  What more could you want?  It costs $40 + tax in the store, here on Amazon, it's $30, free ship, a must have.  My previous mouse was optical but not cordless....moving a laptop around the house is very annoying when you have a long mouse cable meant for a desktop computer, now mousing is effortless.....definitely buy this mouse....Logitech is a brand you can trust!!
