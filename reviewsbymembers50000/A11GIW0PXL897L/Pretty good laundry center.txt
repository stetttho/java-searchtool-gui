 I bought this laundry center because I needed to hang dry some clothes, but now I realize I think I just needed a rod because I haven't used the sorting bags to date, 2 months later.  It's a good idea to include sorting bags, but I think another nice alternative would have been a rod on top and a flat drying area on the bottom.  So if you just need a rod for hanging drying, there's cheaper items out there.  But if you really need the sorting bins, go for it.    PS it came in an amazingly small box....it wasn't stable until every last piece was assembled.  If it was $20 (twenty dollars) I would have been happier, I think it's slightly over priced.  Good luck!!
