 If you're looking for a quality, attractive, and inexpensive Scrabble board game look at this deluxe edition!  It is plain and simple your best bet.  Of course you can buy the cheapie Scrabble for $9 or $10, but you're getting a much better board here.  The tiles are locked into their spot because there's a plastic grid, no more accidents, the tiles are prettier - a rich cherry wood color, and BEST OF ALL the board spins OVER your tile holders.  How many times have you knocked the board into the other person's tiles?  It gets old, fast!  This is a quality set - I've owned it for over 2 years now and it looks almost brand new.  You won't be dissapointed!  A wonderful education tool for any age.  It's such a nice set and improvement upon the old deluxe set that I'm buying it for a family member's bday.  I don't know what other people are talking about "cheap plastic", this is a QUALITY set.  Buy it at a store, if you hate it, return it!  SIMPLE!  Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!
