 I am a very poor golfer, if I break 100 I am a happy man.  however I do enjoy the game (I am still trying to figure out why).  This book takes you trough about a year and a half of life in the professional golf world.  Through all levels of the game, the PGA Tour, the Senior Tour, The Nike Tour and Q-School.  Through reading this book you learn what a world class golfer must go through to be that good.  Realize that in golf, there are no home games so that means enormous amounts of time away from family. Also, golfers have to work everyday to maintain that edge. This is such a tight knit group that competitors will actually give pointers to each other during practice.  It was a well written piece that shed a lot of light on a world most of us will never see.  However the only reason this book does not receive a 5 is that by page 400 I found myself thinking "If I have to read about one more chip shot, I'm gonna scream."  Anyway if you have any interest in the PGA tour, or golf in general, this book is well worth your time. Thanx  T
