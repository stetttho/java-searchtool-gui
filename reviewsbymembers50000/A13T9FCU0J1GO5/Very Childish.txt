 I found this book in my personal collection, since it is an anthology, and I had already finished most of it, I decided to finish it. I started reading the book when I was 14 years old, I remembered being enthralled. As time passed and I have grown up, my opinions have changed. The tales told in this book are very formulmatic and childish. As I was finishing the book I would read aloud to my wife the most ridiculous passages just so I was not the only one who had to suffer. To a 12-14 year old fan of the Batman character, this would qualify as an interesting read, to a grown man who has distanced himself from the caped crusader, this is an awful collection. T
