 This is simply "An Autobiographical Collage".  A collection of Op-Ed pieces, speeches givin, short family tree and some things that had no where else to go.  As a fan of Kurt, I own most of his books, and I had this one for 3 years before I read it because I wanted to read more of his fiction before I found out about the man.  Some of the articles mention his past novels and it is helpful to have read them to get a true understanding of what he is talking about. It was refreshing to see that Kurt believes the worst book he ahs written is Slapstick, he gives it a D.  I never liked that book, and now I feel like it is OK to not like it.  All in all this is no more than a short attention span book that will fill 5 minutes here or there.  If you have just a passing interest in Vonnegut, do not bother with this book.  However if you are a big Vonnegut fan like me, you might want to pick this up and get a little insight into his warped mind. T
