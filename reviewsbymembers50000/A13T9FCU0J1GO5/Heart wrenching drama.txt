 "Why do people have to die?" "To make life important." Wow, so simple, yet so profound. This show is just full of stuff like this. The show begins traumatically with the death of the father right before a family reunion/Christmas dinner.  We then follow the sons, Nate and David, the daughter Claire an the widow Ruth, try to restart their lives after such a loss. Each person has their own faults and try to work through everything. All of this takes place in the middle of the family business, a funeral parlor.  Periodically they will have visitors who seem like ghosts, but who are not. Like the other great HBO drama, the Sopranos, this show is equal parts comedy and tragedy. Sometimes you laugh sometimes you cry.  But is always enthralling.  About the DVD: Nothing too special about the special features. A few interviews and commentary tracks. The greatness of the show itself makes is so these little extras are not necessary. T
