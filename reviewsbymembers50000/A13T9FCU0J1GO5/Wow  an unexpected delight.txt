 I believe that this is the directorial debut of Bill Paxton, and if it is, wow.  This is one of those films that did not get a wide Theatrical release that may have slipped through the cracks. It is the story of a father and his two sons, and the fathers revelation that God has tapped them to kill demons that walk among us, to be God's hand.  While one son assumes that his father has gone crazy, the other believes in him without question.  After the kids have grown up, one of them decides to follow in their fathers footsteps and kill demons (who look like normal people) while the other eventually decides to turn in his brother for being the God's hand killer.  The movie is told in a narrative by Fenton Meiks (Matt McConaughey) as he is convincing an FBI agent that his brother is the murderer. This is a well written, suspenseful film that tears at you, and is wonderfully crafted.   About the DVD:  This one is chock full of extras, including the trailer, the making of, scenes, a documentary from the Sundance channel, and three different commentaries. An absolute goldmine of information.  Even without these features, the film would still rate a five. T
