 The final book in the career of Joseph Heller is a fine tale.  The protagonists plight is having to live up to past glory.  Eugene Pota is trying in his twilight years to write a novel that will appeal to the masses and "be a Hollywood movie".  Pota's career began with great acclaim and success, but he subsequent novels have fallen into the category of good or "not one of his best".  As he flips back an forth from writing this novel to complaining about not being able to write it and just living you can get lost in the action.  The book so closely parallels what one would believe to be Hellers own career.  Catch-22 to ... well, everything else, books that may have been best sellers, but no one remembers now, unless you are a fan of Heller.  These closes parallels tend haze parts of the novel,  however it all comes together on the last page, it makes you wonder if this was a narration of what Heller himself went through to write this, his last novel.  I found the book to be fast paced, comical and memorable.  A fine way to spend an evening or two.  Thanx for your time,  T
