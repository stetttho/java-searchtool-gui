 This is the story of Jerry Lundegaard.  A hapless car salesman who needs money to repay the money he stole from GMAC. Why did Jerry steal money from GMAC?  NO one knows, that is never brought up in the film, and it took me 6 viewings to realize that we never knew why he needed the money; I suppose that is because it is inconsequential to the plot.  Jerry hatches a scheme by which he hires two thugs to kidnap his wife.  Jerry would then tell his rich father in law about the situation and get the ransom and split it with the thugs.  Sounds simple, only everything goes wrong.  But through all the mix ups and catastrophes, Jerry never gives up on his plan.  He is eternally optimistic that it will work out for him.  Through it all you have local Minnesota law enforcement looking into the case and the crime scenes left behind by the 2 thugs.  Frances McDormand won an Oscar for her role as Sheriff Marge Gunderson.  But by and large, fans of the film believe William H Macy was screwed.   About the DVD: The DVD contains the regular DVD goodies, deleted scenes, trailers and commentary.  The two big bonuses are the interview with the Cohen brothers and the documentary "Minnesota Nice".  But above and beyond all that there is a trivia track that plays like pop up video through the course of the movie that is addictive.  The extras make this great movie even better. If you have the choice of this version or the El Cheapo, do yourself a favor and spend the few extra bucks for the special edition, it is truly special.
