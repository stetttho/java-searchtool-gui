 I don't mean that in a bad way.  This book is very typical of Kurt and his craft.  It is very similar to the 12 other books by him that I have read in pace and patterns.  But like Slapstick, his look at the future did not enthrall me.  Also I am not an environmentalist so the overall theme of the book "Humans will destroy the Earth if we don't do something" didn't touch me.  The only character in the book who is compelling is the headless son of Kilgore Trout.  His roll is the events is so passive that you can't "root" for him. And there was no one else in the book to grab my attention.  All in all it was written well and read quick, like all his previous books, but there was nothing in it that jumped out and begged for attention.  Thanx for your time: T
