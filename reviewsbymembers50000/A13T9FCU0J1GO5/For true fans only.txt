 The Salmon of Doubt gives the impression by its sub title that this may be the 6th hitchhiker book.  It is not. This is a collection of essays and speeches that DNA had given, with a few short stories. The short story titled the Salmon of Doubt is a Dirk Gently novel that does not have a firm ending, which is obviously because DNA died before he finished writing it. All in all there were some astute observations and some wonderfully comic moments from DNA. I would only recommend this book to true die hard friends of DNA. For those of you who are thinking of giving Mr. Adams a chance, go read the Guide to the Galaxy first. Thanks  T
