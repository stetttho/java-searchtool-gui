 The Film: Jaws, as most of us know is the story of a lonely shark looking for love ... or it is the story of a vicious eating machine with a penchant for the dramatic.  Hailed as an all time classic by most, this is the film that put Spielberg on the map.  The emotion from the characters jumps out and grabs you.  You can feel the fear and the sorrow in everyone.  Not much can be written about it here that has not already been seen elsewhere.  I would qualify this as a horror movie.  The dramatic tension and the build up creates a real presence of fear and horror, that today's special effects driven splatter fests cannot even dream of achieving About the DVD: While this is only a one disc edition, they still had room to include a making of featurette, deleted scenes, outtakes, trailers and a trivia game and a screen saver.  A fine assortment of toys that would round out any film, but accent this one perfectly.  T
