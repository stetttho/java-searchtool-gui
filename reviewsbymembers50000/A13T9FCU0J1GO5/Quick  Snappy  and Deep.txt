 If you have never read Vonnegut, I suggest starting here. This ia a fine novel with a unique premise. Each chapter the author is killed and brought back to life so he can interview souls on the other side, both famous and ordinary. The insights brought back are well worth the trip. The major flaw in this book is the fact that it is only 77 pages (paperback). With a cast of characters that could span all of human history, there was so much more that could have been done. Thanx for your time, T
