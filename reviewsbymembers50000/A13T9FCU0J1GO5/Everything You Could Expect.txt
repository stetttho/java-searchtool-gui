 This is a fine collection of the thoughts and witticisms of William F Buckley. It covers most any area that Mr. Buckley holds an Interest whether it be politics, social affairs, sailing, classical music and spending time with dignitaries and well to do people.  It is fantastically written (as can be expected from Buckley) however it seemed to talk just over the head of the common man.  With his infatuation with the Ryder Cup and talking about people who are important to him, really have no impact on my life.   All in all it is a very well written fast paced collection.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys political and social commentary. And to anyone who just like to read something different than a novel or text of history. Thanks For Your Time: T
