 If you read the first of this series, you really needn't bother with this one.  Unlike most series out there, it makes no difference which order you read these in.  Just a collection of stories of people who are too stupid to be alive, and aren't. However, one glaring flaw in this book is the constant listings of tales that are "unconfirmed by Darwin". If the story is unconfirmed, essentially meaning it is untrue, why put it in a book of "true stories".  A few of these false Darwin's would be OK, but this book is nearly half full of these falsehoods.  It was a little disappointing.  However, it is amusing to read the tales and imagine what kind of morons would partake in such activities.  Really you could read any of the books in this series; they are essentially the same, so if you have a choice between the 3 (so far) pick the cheapest.  T
