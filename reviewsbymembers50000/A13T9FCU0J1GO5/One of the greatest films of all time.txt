 This is my favorite film, and over the years I have watched it grow from a near box office flop to one of the most beloved films.  This is the tale of Andy Dufrense convicted of murdering his wife "and the fella she was banging." Andy is then sent to Shawshank prison to server back to back life sentences. While there he meets Red, the only guilty man in Shawshank, and his group of friends that make the time easier. He also meets Boggs and the bull queers who make his life a living hell.  Through the course of actions, Andy begins to accept he is in prison and makes the best of it.  He uses his skills as a banker to do favors for the warden and the guards, and in return he tries to make Shawshank more tolerable for all, by building a library and helping to educate the inmates.  Andy seems content to remain in prison, he has found his niche, then he gets word that there may be evidence that could set him free, when the warden disregards the information, Andy generally goes insane and makes a last ditch effort to get out. The film is a roller coaster of emotions, some comical, some tragic, and in the end total redemption.  I have seen it many times and still come close to tears at points.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman create wonderful characters and should have both won Oscars.  Since this films release it has moved to number 2 on the IMDB.com list, just behind the Godfather. About the DVD: It is sparse, which is to say that it does not have the toys that we have come to know and love from our discs (Behind the scenes, trailers, deleted scenes, directors/actors commentary) this one only has the Theatrical trailer.  Hopefully with this being the 10 year anniversary of The Shawshank Redemption, Warner Brothers will capitalize on the occasion and release a collectors edition rife with all the requisite goodies.
