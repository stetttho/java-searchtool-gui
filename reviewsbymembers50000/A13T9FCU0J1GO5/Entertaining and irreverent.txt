 This novel is a wonderfully paced comical satire on ... life the universe and everything.  Filled superb writing and quirky storyline this book is short enough to read in one day.  Thankfully there are four sequels in this trilogy there is no shortage of adventures and insane situations for Arthur, Zaphod, Ford, Trillian, Marvin and whoever is met page to page.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys rambling humor.  While the book is confusing, it only makes you want to turn the pages more.  The writing style reminded me of Joseph Heller.  I may be one of a handful of people who have ever compared Heller to Adams, but the irreverence and the quick chatter gave me a definite feel of Heller.  One of these reviews said that this book was a great work of British comedy, don't let that scare you, it is really a great work of comedy.  Also don't let the Science Fiction genre scare you either.  This novel is so snappy and "plausible" that you get so caught up in the characters and story that you forget it is science fiction. Thanx for your time. T
