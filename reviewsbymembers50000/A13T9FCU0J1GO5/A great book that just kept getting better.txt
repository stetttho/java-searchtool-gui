 I got the book Red Dragon because I enjoyed the movie silence of the lambs and the pure evil that is Hanibal Lecter.  I was a little disappointed that Lecter was a rather minimal character. However taht is where my  disappointment ended.  Will Graham is a truly engrossing character and the  villain Francis Dolarhyde almost made you feel sorry for him. All in all a  great fast read that keeps the pages going until stunning twist and a  startling ending.
