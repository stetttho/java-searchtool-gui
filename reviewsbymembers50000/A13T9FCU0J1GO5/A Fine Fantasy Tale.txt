 Some people compare this novel to Lord of the Rings, and it is easy to see why.  But I do not see that as a determent.  Through the 800+ pages of text you meet many different and fascinating characters while our core is basically defined in the first hundred and expanded throughout.  There are many typical fantasy elements.  The naive group sent on a chase or being chased never having enough time to wonder about what is happening to them.  However as noted by a few other reviews here, Jordan knew what he was doing when he wrote this.  He introduced you to a few characters and let them slip by, and you know you will see them again in one of the (as of now) 8 sequels. All in all the only real difference between this and all other fantasy novels I have read is the strong presence of women as warrior/leaders.  The novel is finely written and if you truly enjoy it, it will take up more than a few evenings to reach the climactic ... well it doesn't really end, so much as it runs out of room. If you are a fan of fantasy I highly recommend this one, if you are not a big fantasy fan, perhaps you should start on something lighter. Thanks For your time. T
