 This is not as good as the original, but what ever lives up to the original?  This is still a fine novel rife with the irreverent humor that this series is noted for.  Again we watch our cast be dumped into situations we can barely imagine. Through time travel, to ancient earth, to incredible torture devices to even the headquarters for the Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy!  One minor flaw in the book is that you have to read the first novel to really have a clue as to what is going on in this one. All in all this is a very funny and entertaining read. Had I not read The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy this novel would probably rank a 5, however since I did read the first book and I gave that one a 5, and this one is not quite as good, this one had to be given a 4.  Thanks for your time.   T
