 This book covers everything you need to know to improve your game.  Mr. Pennick's insights are quick and concise.  This is ibe of the best instructional books I have ever read. The only advice I have to give is to take one tip at a time.  Pick one thing to work on, when you feel you have achieved what Mr. Pennick said, then move on to something new.  The tips are also sprinkled with tales of yesteryear and legends of the game. It is difficult to read this without wanting to put the book down and try each tip as it comes along, I would say read the book once, then go back and work on the things that made hte most sense to you.
