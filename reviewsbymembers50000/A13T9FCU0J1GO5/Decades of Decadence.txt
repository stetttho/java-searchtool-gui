 This is the tale of Marvin Lee Aday.  AKA Meat Loaf.  This fills in all the blanks in his life.  You see where he came from, where he went and how he got there.  It is told with comic irreverence.  It shows you hte hell it is to be a struggling musician, and the hell it is to be a successful one.  If you hve never read a Rock biography, I recommend this one because Meat is not your typical strung our junkie that most Rock bio's exault.  Thanx for your time, T
