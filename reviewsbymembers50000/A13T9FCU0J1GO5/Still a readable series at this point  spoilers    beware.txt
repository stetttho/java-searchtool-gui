 This is the most 'nothing' book in the series so far. Not a whole lot really happens.  Reading it and coming to the end, I realized that Jordan realized that he had a fantasy franchise on his hands and was going to milk it for all it was worth.  Don't get me wrong the book is well written, there are some tense moments that get your blood racing.  But there is no big monumental event like the first three books ended with. Yes there is the big meeting of the Aiel, but since when is the climax of a fantasy novel a meeting.  The final two chapters pack in all the action or confronting multiple forsaken, which could have been built up more along the way.  There is the trolloc attacks on Emonds Field, and the rise of Perrin as a warrior leader among his hometown people.  However there are certain plot points that are beginning to wear on me: The Whitecloaks being so corrupt, yet none of them seeing that they are corrupt, the ever present fear of the Dragon and the One Power, and the fact that none of the 'good guys' can get it together and kill the 'bad guys'.  When you have beaten a forsaken, just kill them, don't wait for a trial, when you have pure evil at your fingertips ready to be killed, don't let it walk free.  I can see why most people I have talked to about this series give up around the fifth book.  T
