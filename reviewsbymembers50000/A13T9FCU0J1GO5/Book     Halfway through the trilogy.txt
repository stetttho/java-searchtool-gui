 This is anohter fine tale from Douglas Adams, taking us on wild adventures with Arthur, and the rest.  The difference in this one is that Arthur is finally starting to actually do things. rather than jsut standing around saying what.  In this one we get to see Arthur and trillian save the universe, and we learn to fly, which was my favorite part of the novel.  The key is to throw yourself at the ground and miss.  I enjoyed it. I am in the process of reading the entire trilogy, but I am putting it down after each book because, not being a fan of Sci - Fi,  I do get a little tired of the names and ridiculous situations.  If you are going to read the trilogy and you are not a big sci fi fan, take a break in between each novel.  Thanks for your time T.
