 This is a book that one each page, plausibly puts forth another unbelievable experience. Gaiman skillfully created a fantastic world full of impossible possibilities.  From people keeping their life hidden to people falling through the cracks.  The banter between the arch villains Croup and Vandemar is so light and breezy you forget they are pure evil. The Marquis is a slick, likeable, fast talking charlatan. He is equal parts mischief and good and evil. You never know what to expect. Door and Richard are the main characters, and they are built flawlessly with Gaiman's narrative.  This is a very enjoyable novel.  I got this book because I enjoyed American Gods, I can safely say that this is Gaiman best effort at a Novel to date.  T
