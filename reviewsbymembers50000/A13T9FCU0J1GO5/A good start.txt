 I realize that I will be ridiculed for giving this book such a low rating. However, it took me almost 2 years to finish it. Not having been a Tolkein aficionado, it was difficult at times to realize who was who in the narrative. After seeing the film by Peter Jackson, I was able to visualize, with greater ease, the cast of characters.  Overall the book is very good, filled with everything you would expect from a fantasy novel, because in essence Tolkein created the Fantasy novel. You have plenty of running and fighting and philosophy.  If you have only seen the film, and enjoyed it, you should read this book to fill in the cracks, it makes everything make more sense.  Thanks for your time. T
