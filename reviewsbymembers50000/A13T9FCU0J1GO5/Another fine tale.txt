 For those that have enjoyed the first two parts of this series, this book will not disappoint on most levels.  For the most part the book does not deal with the Dragon, but the people chasing the Dragon. The action is fast and exciting when it happens.  During the middle of the book Jordan chose to focus on one group for 230 pages. That is all well and good, but I found myself wanting to know what was happening to the other characters. The chapters did breeze by, all with logical ending and starting points, so the flow was definitely quick. I have heard bad things about the series after about book 5 or 6, people just begging for it to end, however I have not reached that point yet. I am still emotionally connected to all the main characters and would be not be happy to see them die, except maybe Nyneave and her damn tugging of her hair. OK OK I get it she tugs on her braid when she is nervous or angry. But does she have to do it in every chapter? Anyway, you should enjoy this journey into the Wheel of Time. Thanks T
