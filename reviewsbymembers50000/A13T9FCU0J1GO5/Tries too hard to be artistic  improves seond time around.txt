 I am a big fan of PT Anderson, but I found this to be his weakest effort to date.  It was refreshing to see Adam Sandler play against his usual types of characters, and play a sweet, meek, insecure man who is looking for something in life.  He finds it in an alluring woman who knew one of his sisters.  Their budding relationship is interrupted by a visit from the cronies of a phone sex company trying to extort money from him.  My wife could not stay awake through he film and just said it was boring, and I tended to agree with her. However when Barry makes the call to the phone sex line, the movie picks up and gains momentum.  Anderson uses some filming techniques that do not really add anything to the film for me. he likes to experiment with colors and scenes are separated by Scopitones, I could have done without both. I think Anderson could have worked a little more on the story than on visual feel.  The way a movie looks can add to it greatly, but when it becomes obvious that the filmmaker seems to be sacrificing story and character development for artistic creation with a camera, the movie suffers. About the DVD: On the extra disc you get a special called Blossoms and Blood, which may as well be called Deleted Scenes. With extra artwork, three theatrical trailers and actual deleted scenes, the extras on the DVD flesh out the characters a little more making the actual film a little more enjoyable, but not much. However, true to PT Anderson's history, this DVD is missing a commentary track.  It would be nice to see PT's thought process. T
