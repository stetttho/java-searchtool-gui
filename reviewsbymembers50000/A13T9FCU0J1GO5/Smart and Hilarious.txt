 This is a very very funny film that has gone by almost unnoticed.  The plot is simple, all life on earth will be dead in a few years if Jim Belushi cannot get John Ritter, a milquetoast, that he has it in him to save the world.  Simple.  Along the way you meet a rogue CIA group dressed as clowns, aliens from another world who want a glass of water and the KGB.  I say this all matter of factly because that is exactly the attitude that Jim Belushi's character does.  He's seen it all before and the hilarity comes when you take someone who has never had an exciting experience in this life (Ritter) and team him with someone that has had so many crazy and wild adventures that even saving the world is mundane. This is a great satire on our national security.  I recommend this film to anyone who does not take everything seriously and/or wants to laugh.  Some of the components are a little over the top, but that's what movies are for. Thanks for your time: T
