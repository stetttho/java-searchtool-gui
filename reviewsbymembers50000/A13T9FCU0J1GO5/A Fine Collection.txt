 This is, for a "fan" of the Mafia, is almost a must own.  It is filled with book excerpts and magazine articles and 2 works of fiction, the rest is all "true".  Or at least as true as Mafia stories go.  My favorite excerpts from this book were the brief portion of Donnie Brasco.  It showed just how mundane going undercover in the Mob can be.  I also quite enjoyed the section from "Killer".  We get to see the mob through a hitmans eyes.  He tells you how cold he is and how after the first couple of hits, he could murder someone then go spend a quiet evening with his family.  He never felt remorse because in his mind "You must have done something pretty bad to bring em to your door."  Also the excerpt from "Boss of Bosses" is comical in the sense that the Mafia Don of the Gambino crime family convinced the 2 FBI agents that had him in custody, to take him out to lunch.  All in all this a fascinating collection that shows the dark side of the mob that tends to get glossed over by the Hollywood productions.  Thanks for your time. T
