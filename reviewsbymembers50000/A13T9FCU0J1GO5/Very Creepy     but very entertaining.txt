 This is the third Neil Gaiman novel I have had the pleasure of reading.  I bought it for my 6th grader and read it to make sure it was "appropriate".  I find that for the most part it is, but it has its disturbing moments.  The illustrations in the novel definitely add to the unnerving nature of the book. The character of the other mother is not fully developed, but is a villain you can still root against.  Coraline is a fine, strong character.  The novel is also filled with trademark Gaiman off kilter humor.  I found it very enjoyable and would recommend it to most anyone. T
