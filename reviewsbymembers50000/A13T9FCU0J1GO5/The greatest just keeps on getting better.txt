 I have been loyal to the Madden football franchise for many years, because it has consistently failed to disappoint. The 2004 version is no different.  As always there is tremendous game play.  If you have played one version of Madden, you can play this one. The reason I say that it just keeps getting better is the feature of Owner mode. IN this you are the OWNER of the team, not just the head coach.  Some may call it micromanagement, but I love it.  You get to hire a Head Coach, Offensive and Defensive Coordinators and a Special teams coach.  These coaches have an effect on the intangibles of your players, especially intelligence. Another great bonus how you sign players for your teams. The signing bonus is spread out over the course of the contract and the salary escalates yearly.  This makes it more challenging to hold onto your star players.  Other nice new options in owner mode are, the ability to create/renovate your stadium and the ability to create/relocate a team. It is also fun to watch NFL players become NFL coaches.  All in all, as I said the game play is terrific, and the additions of owner mode have made this the only console game I play. T
