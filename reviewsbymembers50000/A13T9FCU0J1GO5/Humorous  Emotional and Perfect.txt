 I enjoy the fast paced novel that makes you feel good.  And this work by James Paterson is just that.  A touching story of mid life and love lost.  Travis McKinley is a lifelong golfing enthusiast who has an epiphany on Christmas morning and can finally sink any putt he needs.  After this dramatic improvement in his game he gets let go from his position in an advertising firm.  He decides that there is no time like the present to join the Senior PGA tour.  He makes serious money playing a game he has loved all his life.  He is in the most picturesque locations and living the life, however he is miserable because he is losing the one woman he has ever loved.  And then the miracle happens.  This is one of the best books I have ever read, I highly recommend it.  At only 149 pages (paperback) it is long enough to tell the whole story, yet short enough to leave out all the minute details that do not make a difference.  This book should get 6 stars, or more, but the scales does not go that high, we will have to settle for a 5.  Thanx for your time, T
