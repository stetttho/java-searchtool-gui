 There was nothing too special about this collection.  Just a sparse collection of little facts about things we take for granted. It was interesting, but the skeptic in me wanted to know how the information was collected, but Voorhees fails to give us a bibliography.  Most who know me know I love useless information, but for some reason this did not enthrall me all that much.  If you can find this book in paperback cheap, and you like stupid little facts, go for it.  But I would not pay more than 5 bucks for it Thanks
