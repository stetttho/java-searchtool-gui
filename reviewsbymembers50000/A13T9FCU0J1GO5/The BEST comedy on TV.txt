 This is the funniest show on television.  However because of its nature, few people know about it.  It is on HBO, which allows it to be as bold as it has to be, but it also reduces the number of possible viewers. The other reason is the show is built like a house of cards, that invariably comes crashing down at the end. This is not a show that you can flip on ten minutes in.  Everything builds and builds until it explodes in a burst of comic delight.  The final reason why this show is not as well known is that it is very 'acidic'.  Larry and the cast do not pull any punches, and the situations Larry gets in are often uncomfortable, but well worth the time.  As each episode progresses the mostly improvisational dialogue becomes more refined and fluid, which means the show only gets better with time. About the DVD: The DVD is fine, it includes the "HBO Special" that inspired the series, however the audio commentary is sparse, and each episode is 1 chapter, so there is no skipping ahead in an episode, you just have to watch the whole thing.
