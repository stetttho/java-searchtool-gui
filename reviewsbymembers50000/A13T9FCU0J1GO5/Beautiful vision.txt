 prot (pronounced like goat) is a genius inter-stellar traveler,  He has come to EARTH to take one person back with him to K-PAX.   Planet thousands of lights years away that is orbited by 2 suns and is absolutely stunning.  A planet with no government, no nations, no love, no hate, no homes, and no responsibilities. If you are tired, lay down and take a nap, if you are hungry eat, no one will ask you to pay for anything, because on K-PAX there is no currency.  It is Nirvana, as prot describes it.  It is no wonder why most everyone who speaks with prot wants to return to paradise with him.  He is in a mental institution under the care of Dr. Gene Brewer.  Gene does not believe for a moment that prot is an alien.  However everything he says about his home planet is investigated (to the best of human ability) and found to be true.  Is prot a visitor from another world?  Or is he just a mental patient who needs help to realize that his is not from K-PAX, and he is , in fact as human as the rest of us?  Overall it was a fine novel, and I am looking forward to the movie starring Kevin Spacey as prot.  Thanx for your time, T.
