 In this novel Puzo steps out of his standard world of massive corruption (mafia), into another, politics.  The book is fast moving and if you read the cover jacket it only tells about the first quarter of the book.  There  is much more.  It is a sttory of a man who tries his best to be a decent  man, but after a string of horrible events that ruin everything he has once  held dear, he slowly makes the transition to "the dark side".   With subtle change you watch the character of Francis Kennedy turn from a  man of honor to a man of evil.  Some of the elements of the book are  completely unbelievable, but isn't that what fiction is for?
