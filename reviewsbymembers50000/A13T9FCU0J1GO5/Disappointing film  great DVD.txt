 This movie deserves a three, but the DVD extras are so good, it gets a four. I read the book that this is based on, and that may have been my problem. I was expecting too much. I am not a fan of Leo, but I do quite enjoy Chris Walken, I think he is great in this role.  However the movie tends to be a slow plodding homage to the era when the events take place.  The story of how a 18 year old kid turned into the one of the greatest non violent con men in American history seems to take a backseat to Steven Spielberg's infatuation with the era.  What is missing is the breezy carefree attitude that Mr. Abagnale expressed so easily in the book.  The film tries to hard to be moralistic.  I guess I was just expecting more when such a talented group of film makers and actors too on a great book like this. About the DVD:  I got this DVD for my birthday and watched disc one almost immediately, and was left disappointed, it took a few months for me to dig this out and take a look at disc two. It is loaded and is imminently more interesting than the film.  There are 5 vignettes on the supplemental disc that are all worth your time. Especially the retrospective on the real Frank Abagnale.  I found myself engrossed in the features and actually started to like the movie more by what I saw on disc two.  I would suggest this as just a rental T
