 Good versus evil.  That is this book in a nutshell.  The cast of good characters pitted against almost insurmountable odds.  Against an evil presence that consumes and kills.  Pretty standard for a Stephen King Novel.  There are many references to the killings in this novel and many ways of death.  Again, typical of King. One thing that was not typical of King was the power and presence of God.  In this novel it is God's will that people survive and it is God's will that evil will lose.  The suspense is engrossing from the first page to the last.  You grow to feel for the characters and most of all you HATE the villain, the unformed entity TAK.  Most horror novels have a villain that you can't get behind and loathe.  There is no worry for that in this book, TAK is pure evil on paper and it is easy it hate it. Which makes the ending (which is a little predictable) more uplifting.  All in all this is a fine read which failed to get 5 stars only because I have read a few too many horror novels and could see cliches littering the pages. Thanx for your time. T
