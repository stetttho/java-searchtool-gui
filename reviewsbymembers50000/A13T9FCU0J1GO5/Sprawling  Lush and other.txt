 This was a fine book, but unfortunately I couldn't read it straight through, I had to put it down for a month, I guess I just don't have the endurance for a 700+ page book, I put them all down after 400 pages and take a break.  This was a look at the world of Atlanta, Socialites and business is a town that (apparently) is not that far from the sticks.  Since I have never been to Atlanta, or anywhere down south, I do not know if this rings true to socialite, elitist Atlanta.  It is a good weaving of 3 tales, A successful Atlanta business man who has made some bad decisions lately and is about to lose it all, the mayor of Atlanta and an old friend teeming up to prevent a social tragedy involving a heinous deed perpetrated by a despicable man, who just happens to have the right social standing, and a laborer who is sent to prison after the worst string of bad luck I have ever seen and finds salvation in the words of Epictetus and Zeus.  I found the book engrossing at times and long winded at others.  If there had been about 200 fewer pages I would have rated this book a 4 or a 5, but it just seemed to drag a little. If long novels don't bother you then I strongly suggest this one. If you are more a fan of the quick, short book, don't bother.  Thanx for your time, T
