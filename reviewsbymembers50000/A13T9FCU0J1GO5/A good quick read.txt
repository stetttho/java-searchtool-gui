 A good quick read about an American Society where machines take care of all the work for us humans.  After all the mahines are more efficient than man could ever be.  Thoughout the book the question is constantly posed  "if machines do all the work, what is a human being for?"  The  question is mainly left unanswered by kurt, I guess he leaves that up to us  to figure out.  All in all it was a good book that kept my interest and i  would recommend to anyone, especially someone who is a fan of Kurt  Vonnegut's work.
