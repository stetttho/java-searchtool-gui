 This is a fine book along the lines of all previous John Douglas books.  It takes a look inside the mind of evil and hate.  Douglas tries to make sense of why people do the horrible things people do.  He never condones them, he just tries to find out why the acts were committed so that we may prevent them in the future.  If you enjoy true crime and the criminal investigation process then I highly recommend all Douglas books (Mindhunter, Journey Into Darkness, and Obsession) If grisly crimes scenes are not your style, and you don't particularly care for true crime then don't bother. Thanx for your time, T
