 A waste, a total waste of Hannibal Lecter and the writing ability of Thomas Harris.  There are parts of the book that are on the edge of your seat good,  but those are few and far between and overshaddowed with Harris' infatuation with gore.  Between pigs eating people, dogs eating a human face and the finale,  the book just leaves you sick. And regretting wasting the time to read this book.  I rated this book a 1 but it should have been a  zero, but the scale doesn't go that low so I'll have to make do. Thanx for your time:  T
