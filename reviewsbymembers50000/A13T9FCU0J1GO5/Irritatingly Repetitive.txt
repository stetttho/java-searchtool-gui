 I thought I liked Andy Rooney, I was wrong.  This book is a collection of observations of Mr. Rooney, observations that have been poorly researched in some cases (Stating that police officers have a arrest quota was one of the more laughable beliefs). The book is entertaining for a few pages, then Mr. Rooney's constantly whining voice started eating at my brain and I just got sick of the whole thing. If you are a real fan of Andy's 60 Minute spots, then this would probably interest you.   I, however, was nauseated by the constant bitching of a man who has more than most could ever hope to have.
