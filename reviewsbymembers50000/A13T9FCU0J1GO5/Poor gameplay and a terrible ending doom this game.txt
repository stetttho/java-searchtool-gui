 This game was so disappointing that it is the reason that I will not buy a video game based on a movie again.  I know that this game was made by the Wachowski brothers while making the last two films, but the game feels pasted together. You play as wither NIobbe or Ghost an attempt to complete certain missions. rather than being in the mode of a first person shooter or a side stroller you are positioned above the player ala Grand Theft Auto 3, but the movements are not as fluid as in GTA 3.  After a few missions they become mundane. I played this game for a few weeks and just had enough of it. My kids started playing it and I watched them pass the game, I was slightly excited to see what kind of a ending a game based on the Matrix , and all I got was a preview for Matrix 3.  What a disappointment.  Also, you may have heard that if you play this game you will understand the Matrix trilogy better, this is not true. Everything you need to understand the matrix is in the 3 films, this game was just a way for the creators to milk $50 out of us. T
