 While the title of this book may lead you to believe that this book is all about the inside of a newsroom.  That is not entirely true, but it is close.  Mr. Goldberg not only shows us why bias is apparent in the network news room he also picks certain topics(homeless, AIDS, man bashing...) and does a little investigative reporting of his own. I found all of the passages well written and they grabbed my interest. One thing to remember is that this book is not written by a right wing wacko. This is written by a democrat who never voted for Reagan or either Bush.  This is just a man who was sick of seeing the slant and the hypocrisy that goes along with it. I recommend this to anyone who has even a passing interest in the news and how it is reported to the nation. Thanks  T
