 This is one of the MGM series of movie soundtracks that Rykodisc has recently released on CD.It features 13 songs written by Burt Bacharach with lyrics by Hal David.This film score fits the movie perfectly.There are 3  songs with vocals and 10 instrumentals.The highlight of the CD is the great  vocal performance by Tom Jones on the title track.Other highlights are  Manfred Mann's version of "My Little Red Book",which is vastly  superior to Love's version that came a year later.The best instrumental is  "Downhill And Shady",featuring some great electric guitar in the  "British Invasion" style.This enhanced CD also has a funny 3  minute film clip from the beginning of the movie,where Peter O'Toole has  his first therapy session with the deranged shrink played by Peter  Sellers.I recommend this CD for anyone who liked the movie or the early  days of the glorious British Invasion.
