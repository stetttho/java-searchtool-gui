 I'm amazed at the quality of this anthology. Warren Zevon has written and performed songs about the human condition that make you want to laugh and  cry at the same time. I agree with my fellow reviewers that it's difficult  to comprehend how his music hasn't been more well appreciated. There are so  many great songs on this compilation, there's not enough space to describe  them. Instead, I'll just name a few of my favorites. They are  "Splendid Isolation","Mr.Bad Example","Suzie  Lightning","Sentimental Hygiene", and "The French  Inhaler". Warren Zevon is a musical genius. Do yourself a favor and  buy this anthology.
