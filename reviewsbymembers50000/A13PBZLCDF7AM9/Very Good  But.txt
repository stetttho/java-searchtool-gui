 I finally broke down and bought this DVD box set. The first two DVD's are excellent, but the third disc is a real head-scratcher. It's obvious that Tiny Tim was embarrassingly bad and should not have been included. Also, I would have liked to have seen more performances by Al Kooper, Buffalo Springfield, and The Electric Flag (with the great and always wired Mike Bloomfield). On the positive side, I was surprised at just how good the Mamas and the Papas were. I've never been a big M & P fan, but their set was excellent. The Who were also outstanding. The Byrds were okay, but could have been a lot better. If you're a rock music fan/historian, you should have this box set.
