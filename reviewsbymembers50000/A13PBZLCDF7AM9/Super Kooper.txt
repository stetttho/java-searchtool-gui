 In response to the previous reviewer's question, this CD contains the full 11 minute version of "Season Of The Witch". This compilation lives up to its name. It has a generous amount of Al's rare and well known music. The info booklet is informative and entertaining as well. Hopefully, this CD will help more people realize Al's great contribution to rock music.
