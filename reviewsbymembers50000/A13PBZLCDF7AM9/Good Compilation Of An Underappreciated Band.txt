 I've been a fan of this band ever since I saw them open for Elton John here in Greensboro in 1973. At the time, they were the Sutherland Brothers & Quiver. The Sutherlands and Quiver were two bands that merged. Tim Renwick (guitar) and Willie Wilson (drums) were the key members of Quiver. They gave Iain and Gavin Sutherland, both fine songwriters and singers, the musicians they needed to fulfill the potential of their songs. As with all "best of" compilations, there are some songs that didn't make the cut for some reason. Some of the songs that aren't included are: "Ain't Too Proud To Beg","Bluesy World","You & Me","One More Night With You", and "Midnight Rendezvous". There are still a lot of great songs that are here: "Real Love","You Got Me Anyway","Arms Of Mary","Dream Kid","Champion The Underdog","Sailing", and "Love On The Moon". Gavin and Iain both wrote songs that had beautiful melodies, but at times they were lyrically feeble. To my knowledge, the only singles that charted were "Arms Of Mary" and "You Got Me Anyway". Considering the quality of the music in the mid to late '70's, it's depressing to think that a band this talented and accomplished couldn't have had more success. Along with Badfinger, the Sutherland Brothers were one of the bands of the '70's that deserved great success and recognition and got virtually none.
