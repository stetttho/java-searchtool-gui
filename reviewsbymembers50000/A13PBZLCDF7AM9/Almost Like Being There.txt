 I was one of the "lucky" ones who attended Woodstock. I was only  16 and was somewhat of a nerd. The only illegal substance I ingested was  pot, but my purpose here is to review the movie and not to write a  narrative of my personal experience there. For those of you who weren't  there, you'll be happy to know that this movie really does    capture the  true essence of Woodstock. Considering the weather conditions and how  difficult it was to get remotely close to the stage area, I can safely say  that I enjoyed watching the movie more    than I did being there. I agree  with many of the previous reviewers in that there were many glaring  omissions of certain bands and there were simply too many great  performances that didn't make the film. Santana, The Who, and Canned Heat  performed sets that were worthy of being seen in their entirety, and many  other bands deserved much more screen time. I think Michael Wadleigh did an  excellent job of giving the viewer an idea of what it was like to be at  Woodstock, but many of the comments of the people there were overly long  and should have been pared down or deleted. Still in all, watching this  movie gives you a good idea of what it was like to be at Woodstock, and you  don't have to slip in the mud or shiver in the cold.
