 Obviously a couple of these reviewers have no idea what they are talking about, or simply like only what they know.  What I love about Mary Cleere Haran, besides that sultry voice, is that she deftly mixes well-known songs on this disc (i.e. "The Boy Next Door" and "The Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe") with obscure pieces.  I don't want to hear artists repeat what everyone else is doing.  Mary Cleere Haran's choice of material is impeccable, and her singing a thing of beauty to the ears.
