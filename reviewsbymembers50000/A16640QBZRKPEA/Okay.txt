 Fine in the film...bland on CD.  Divorced from the film, Patrick Doyle's score simply cannot touch the sense of wonder, anticipation & magic that John Williams pours into the previous three scores.  It's just is not very interesting to listen to on it's own.  I guess that's the difference between good and great.
