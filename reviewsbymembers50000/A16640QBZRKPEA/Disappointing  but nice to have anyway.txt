 Well...I wish I could say that I really liked this DVD, but I can't.  Loved watching Doug Henning again...some amazing magic, even though his basic tricks were ones we've seen over and over again.  That's all the good news I could find in this filmed performance.  The book by Bob Randall is hideous.  The jokes almost always landed with a thud, and the story line is ludicriously thin. The supporting cast was serviceable with nobody at all standing out.  Didi Conn is very likeable, but she seems like a chimpmunk on speed.  Anita Morris barely registered, even though her vocal register was incredible, and she spent much of her stage time bi-sected. Doug Henning was very stiff, as you could see from the opening choreography where he wasn't sure what hand move was next. Even his trademark delivery of his magic tricks seemed somewhat uncomfortable at times.  He ended each trick with that "ta-da" jump, a great big smile, and his jumpy eyebrows as if to say, "How about that?"  He cannot act at all.  He does make up for that, however, with sheer enthusiam, energy, and brilliant sleight-of-hand magic.  That all having been said, David Copperfield and Penn/Teller owe a lot to Henning's break through style of the seventies. But the biggest question of all is "What happened to the score?"  Stephen Schwartz's enchanting score from the Broadway Cast recording is far from brilliant, but fun to listen to.  This "cutting" of the show destroyed much of the fun.  What good can you say about this show when the best song in the score, "West End Avenue" is nowhere to be found.
