 Finally...the full "Dreamgirls" score with dialogue.  What a cast!  Audra McDonald, Heather Hedley, Lillias White, Billy Porter, Darius de Haas, Norm Lewis, Adrian Bailey...with Alice Ripley, Emily Skinner, Malcolm Gets, Brad Oscar, and Brian Stokes Mitchell thrown in for good measure.  Wish I had been there!  Maybe we can pray for a DVD of the concert.
