 I guess I don't understand some reviewer's definition of "screaming".  Ms. Schuur is singing "jazz"...not "smooth jazz", not "cabaret", not "new age".  I hear nothing that even comes to close to my definition of "screaming".  As a jazz vocalist, Diane Schuur is among the top current singers.  Her vocal range and interpretation is astonishing.  To the reviewers who have admired her "smooth style" for a long time I would like to remind them that when she sings most of her up tempo songs...she does move into her upper range.  She has always sung this way...perhaps that particular reviewer should listen to her earlier work again.  The only thing a would recommend is that Ms. Schuur put an end to groan inducing word plays on her name as titles for her albums.
