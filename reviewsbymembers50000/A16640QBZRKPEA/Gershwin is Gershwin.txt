 I'm rating this a little higher to bring up the overall rating.  Mary Cleere Haran is a marevelous interpreter of all the material she chooses.  To rate this set low because it doesn't have all the "classic" songs on it is an insult to the Gershwin catelog.  Most of the Gershwin catelog is vastly superior to many other composers' best two or three popular songs.  I chose this disc (a) because it was Mary Cleere Haran, and (b) because she doesn't choose just the most predictable numbers, giving the listener the opportunity to expand their familiarity with the Gershwin catelog.  Certainly not as good as Maureen McGovern's tribute (it is one of the best), or Ella Fitzgerald's songbook (no one approaches her set), but it is a wonderful set, nonetheless.
