 I'm not a "Mandy-head", but neither do I hate his style of singing.  I've always admired Mandy's passion for music, and this generous two-disc set is no exception.   The only disc of Patinkin's I cannot bear to listen to is "Mamaloshen"...it provides the worst possibly opportunity for Mandy to overindulge in oversinging.  As with every other disc, Mandy's song choice is impeccable, and I can't argue with most of his interpretive choices...although I've never understood why he feels the need to scream and shout so much.  My only questions about this particular recording are...Why this particular order of songs?  Why the medley format?  I'm not sure I understand how the struture related to Sondheim's career, or indeed, what it was attempting to indicate.  There were no songs chosen that were written after "Dick Tracy"...nothing from 1991-2002.  Reason?  I don't know. Mandy's voice sounds very odd in the first half of the first act.  It has an odd wobble in it, as if he isn't quite in control of his instrument.  It sound like the voice of a much, much older man.  Once he finally belts, (I think it is on the song "Finishing the Hat") it seems as if all the vocal adhesions are broken and his voice is finally warmed up enough to control.  Did he not warm up properly before the show?  Why would Nonesuch accept this second rate sound in the first half of this concert?   I hesitantly recommend this set to Sondheim fans...Patinkin fans will buy it anyway.  It is really an individual choice as to whether or not to buy this one.  But this would not be my choice of a quintessential overview of Sondheim's work.  Paul Ford on piano is, as always, the unsung hero of Patinkin's recordings.  He is a master at following the always unpredictable performances of Patinkin.
