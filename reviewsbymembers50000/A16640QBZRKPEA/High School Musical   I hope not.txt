 Mundane, lame, superficial, unmemorable and boring pop music.  The performers are undoubtedly talented, but all have generic boy / girl pop bubblegum voices...and the genre of music also owes something to bad 80s synth-pop.    Not really worthy of a recording.  Maybe it's better in the context of the show, but I'd bet that a large majority of high school students would find this stuff seriously laughable.
