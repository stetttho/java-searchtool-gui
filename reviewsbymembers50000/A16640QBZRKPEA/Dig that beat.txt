 A fun recording to have on CD.  Very beatnik oriented musical from 1959 with such interesting names in the cast as Tom Aldredge (Into the Woods, Passion) and Larry Hagman!?  The song "New York" is a lot of fun.  The best of the rest the score include "The Ballad of the Sad Young Man" sung by Tan Seitz and  "Laugh, I Thought I'd Die" sung by Richard Hayes.  Larry Hagman has one song, "Travel the Road of Love" and although he doesn't embarrass himself, thank God "I Dream of Jeannie" and "Dallas" were still be come.  He definitely did not inherit his mother's singing ability.  In fact, I think his mother was performing in "The Sound of Music" during the short run of this show.
