 What can you say about Janis Siegel...her style plops right down in between Jazz and Cabaret.  What I like so much on this disc is that she has discovered several songs that are not well known...and have introduced them in her usual classy way.  Her re-recording of "Guess Who I Saw Today" (Originally recorded on the out-of-print title "Experiment in White")is beautiful.  Janis has jumped from label to label to label...but is always worth listening to at any time.
