 A multi-racial cast with very talented individuals...and a fitting tribute the 50th anniversary of the show.  But...you can't possibly rate this higher than the original cast recording, or the 1992 Broadway revival.  It does rank higher than the Jay Records studio cast and the 1976 revival.  I'd invest in one of the previous recordings I've mentioned, before getting this one if you don't have the show on disc yet.
