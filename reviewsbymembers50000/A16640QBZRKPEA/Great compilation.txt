 I don't actually own this particular compilation, however, since I own nearly every recording represented on these discs...I think I'm qualified to comment.  This is a wonderful representation of the high quality of work that DRG Records does. The previous review is way off the mark.  This is definitely not a waste of time or money.  This is 25 years of preserving Broadway shows, Off-Broadway shows, studio recordings (mostly from the city center concerts), etc.  So what if they "aren't as good as the original", DRG is preserving many recordings and artists that other mainstream labels don't or won't.  You have wonderful recordings from Brian Stokes Mitchell, Nathan Lane, Debbie Gravitte, Tyne Daly, Anthony Perkins, Joanna Gleason, Marin Mazzie, Carol Burnett, Heather Headley, Patti LuPone, Barbara Cook, etc., and many of these are from Original Cast Recordings just as they appeared on Broadway.  This is an excellent sampler of the work going on at DRG.  No...I'm not an employee...just an avid listener and collector of theatre recordings.
