 Here is the incomparable, one-of-of-kind Bernadette Peters yet again with great music from Rodgers and Hammerstein.  Especially notable is "I Haven't Got a Worry in the World" from the Anita Loos Play "Happy Birthday".  And the sometimes unjustly forgotten gem "Something Good" from the film version of "The Sound of Music" with music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers.  Great choices...great performances...and fabulous arrangements from Jonathan Tunick.  Pick it up today.
