 Art songs are somewhat like opera in a sense.  They are an acquired taste.  Having an affinity for the work of Michael John LaChiusa, I was interested in hearing a cross-section of work by Ricky Ian Gordon. Three of the tracks here were orginally released on Audra McDonald's first solo outing, "Way Back to Paradise".   I'm fascinated by the process of poetry set to music, but I'm afraid that Gordon's ability, although plentiful, makes too many of these pieces sound musically the same.  Where LaChiusa's unique style still managed to tell the story, (i.e. "The Wild Party", "Marie Christine", "Hello Again"), Gordon doesn't have any story line to hang on to, thus the similarities of the musical sound in the pieces.  It reminded me a lot of Adam Guettel's "Myths and Hymns", which I found difficult to listen to at times as well. The singers are all very good, although Adam Guettel's vocals seem less trained and on target.  However, when you are singing on the same CD with the likes of Audra McDonald, Theresa McCarthy and Dawn Upshaw from the world of opera, and Judy Blazer and Darius de Haas from musical theatre, you are bound to suffer by comparison. The three stars rate the time, effort, and talent that went into the recording.  It's probably not one that will finds its way into my CD changer time after time.
