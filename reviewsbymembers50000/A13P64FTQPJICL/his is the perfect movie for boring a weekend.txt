 Pros: *Neat plot. *Good performances. *Humorous. *Creative (the spying scenes are spectacular). *Meg Ryan is simply the perfect romantic comedy star. She always glows, both talent-wise and  beauty-wise. Cons: *Although Matthew Broderick was almost better than  usual, he still is Matthew Broderick. He's still cold. It looks as if he  has no feelings whatsoever, be they joy, surprise, sadness, anger, or  whatever. He doesn't play them well. Bottom line: Humor-wise, it's  excellent. The French guy is hilarious! Romance-wise, ok, but just ok,  nothing more. Maybe if someone other than Matthew played the part...Matthew  isn't that a good romanitc comedy star. Overall an entertianing  experience.
