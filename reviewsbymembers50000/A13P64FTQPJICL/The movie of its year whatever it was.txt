 Pros: *Some of the most memorably heart-stopping scenes you will ever see in your life. *Star-studded movie(and the stars give you your money's worth of brilliant performances). *Ving Rhames is one of the coolest  actors around(if not THE),and he's here! *John Reno is always creepy and  scary. *The movie of Tom Cruise's career,plain and simple. *VERY cool  gadgets,tricks and plans. *John Voight! Cons: *THE most complicated  and confusing plot you could possibly see.I've seen the movie about 5  times,and still haven't figure it out completely.Nevertheless,the movie  rocked so,so,SO hard!
