 You will get pumped up when you hear James roaring at thestartof the first track:"Gimme fuel,gimme fire,gimme that which Idesire,oooh!"."Fuel" is loud,fast,heavy,with fast and loud drums,cool Hammett solos and monstrous rhythm guitar and bass. Pros: *Some great songs,especially "Fuel","The Memory Remains","Devil's Dance","The Unforgiven 2","Slither",and others. *Some terrific Hammett solos.He was scary in "Devil's Dance"!In fact,they were all frightening in it!   Cons: *Is it true that all the songs are from "Load" outtakes? Bottom line:Excellent(for Metallica fans)/Worthy(for non-Metallica fans)."Fuel" alone is reason enough to buy this album.
