 My favorite Van Halen album.That's because the greatets guitarist of all time stretched his muscles in it.Heck,he's the greatest musician of all time.No one even compares to Eddie Van Halen when it comes to guitars and   music.Not Hendrix,not Clapton,not Page,not even Beethoven.He outdoes them  all,very easily.Call me obsessed or whatever you want to call me ,but it's  the truth. Pros: *Sammy Hagar. *Alex Van Halen. *Michael  Anthony. *Eddie Van Halen. *Simply,it's Van Halen. *Features one of  the band's greatest songs,Poundcake.This song is a musical wonder.It  reached perfection.Everything in it is  perfect:guitars,bass,drums,vocals,solos,and everything imaginable.Eddie Van  Halen's solo here(with Michael's bass and Alex' drums on the background) is  the single most beautiful thing I have ever heard in  my entire life.I lose  the feeling of the outer world  when I hear that song,especially when I get  to that part. *Features some other great songs,like "Man on a  Mission","Judgement Day"(just listen to Eddie's solo and you  will be blown away! Michael ROCKED in it too!),"Spanked"(with  some red-hot solos as well),and other gems. Cons: Nothing. Bottom  line:buy this masterpiece and listen to some real music.If you love  pure,undefiled,unadulterated art,you have "Poundcake".If you're  kinda' sentimental,there's "316".If you love fast rock songs with  smokin' solos,there's "Judgement Day".Want a light,fun,simple yet  artful song?Try "Runaround".How about a song chockfull of bass  and guitars that woukld leave you astonished?Give "Spanked" a  try.You want a musical epic with everyhting you like?Try "In 'N'  Out".And trust me,those are just a few.Just wait till you get to  "Man on Mission","Pleasure Dome"(drum mania!),and the  rest of tracks.
