 One of the greatest movies of all time(I'm sure you got sick and tired of hearing this all the time!). Pros: *The dialogue is unbelievable.I think it's the best dialogue since GoodFellas. The dialogue's got  everything:humor,intensity,wise cracks and everything you'd enjoy to hear  and repeat all day long. *Reserructing the careers of Samuel L. Jackson  and John Travolta.Stellar performances.Samuel was  hysterical. *Excellent(though a little confusing)direction. *The movie  is virtually star-studded. *Surprisingly,Bruce Willis acted  brilliantly. *Harvey Keitel's scenes were some of the best parts in the  film.Is this guy a great actor or what? *A John Travolta dancing  scene. Cons: *The movie's a little confusing.I've seen it about six  times,and still haven't gathered the plot in one specific order. *Does  anyone know what was in the briefcase?I still don't know. The  bottomline:buy it immediately. Although the DVD isn't full of your usual  extras,the movie itself is cool enough.
