 I just want to say this about Metallica's ballads,especially "The Unforgiven" here:I'm not a very sentimental person when it comes to entertainment.But Metallica's artistic truthfulness blows me away.All I  could say is this:"Sanitarium" almost brought me to  tears,"The Unforgiven" did.I was trying not to let my self go all  along,but in the end,especially when Hammett's solo broke in,I couldn't  hold it any more.Truly amazing song. I forgot to mention some things  about the last two songs: -"My Friend of Misery":Cool  chorus.Has one of Hammett's longest solos,and it's awesome. -"The  Struggle Within":Pretty good song.Hammett's solo is just amazing and  the song is so powerful. And why dosn't anyone comment on James'  unsurpassed guitar abilities?He's the uncrowned king of rhythm guitar.He  playes it flawlessly as fast as thunder,and he does it so perfect,that it  feels as if a supercomputer is generating the sound.In the end,I'll say  this:Jaymz is the one who made me LOVE rhythm guitar.
