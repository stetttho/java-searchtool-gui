 Pros: *In my humble opinion,I think that the punishing "King Nothing" is the best song here.Extremely powerful.It alone makes this album good,but not great,since the new style isn't as good as,say,the black  album's. *A lot of songs to choose from(14!) Cons: *Not the best  Metallica album.Doesn't get close to the black album,or Reload. Bottom  line:Not the best start if you're a non-Metallica fan,but a terrific choice  for Metallica fans,for the astonishingly powerful "King Nothing".
