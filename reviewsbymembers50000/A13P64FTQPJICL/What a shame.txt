 I saw the trailer, and I got anxious to see the movie. First of al, Frank Oz is a brilliant comedy director (seen "Bowfinger"?He directed it).Second, Kevin Kline is funny. Third, the concept(a highschool teacher in a small town who gets in trouble when the town thinks he's gay) sounded  hilarious. When I watched the first part of the movie, it was funny.  However, as the film goes, it gets more and more serious. But you know what  annoyed me?Instead of keeping the movie funny till they end(like Tom  Shadyac and the Farrelly Brothers), Frank starts showing compassion for  homosexuality, and those feelings seriously affected the movie. Wasn't it  suposed to be a comedy?Had I known that it was going to be a a compassion  message, I wouldn't have wasted my time and money. Pros: *Some moments  are very funny... Cons: *...but unfortunatley, they get fewer as the  film goes on. Bottom line: look Frank: since you sold the film(through  the trailer) as a comedy, then you should've kept it that way. ...
