 About the controversial editing,I think that it's both outstanding and mediocre.It's brilliant because the DVD combines the best elements of both nights of the concert,which makes the concert absolutely amazing.But the  problem is that instead of focusing on a single band member or the band as  a whole,the camera shoots from a far distance.This happens a lot,and it's  pretty annoying.Nevertheless,the editing as a whole is spectacular and  brilliant.When they shoot Eddie,they focus on his hands most fo the  time.What a feeling it is,watching a close up of the greatest guitarist in  the world doing a blisteringly fast solo.
