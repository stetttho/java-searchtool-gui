 I have been hearing about this movie for a long time. Some said it's the greatest movie of '93.Some said it's the greatest film of the decade. And some even said it's the greatest movie ever. Why they say that is a mystery  to me. I see nothing that great about it. Pros: *Stellar performances,  namely Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes. *The black and white  idea was excellent. It gave the movie a magical touch. *The direction was  brilliant. I was amazed that Steven Spielberg could make a good movie that  doesn't rely on visual effects, like the rest of his movies. *The  editing(done by the same talented editor of Saving Private Ryan, Michael  Kahn)was amazing too. *The score was perfect. John Williams is always  amazing. Cons: *Some "facts" in it should've been said to be  fictitious, like the 6 million number .Shame on you, Spielberg. *The  movie (at 3+ hours) is too long. *Where are the translations of the  Hebrew and German dialogues? Bottomline: Not worth the noise. I'll  probably get a lot of hate mail and negative numbers below, but I don't  care. I just stated my opinion.
