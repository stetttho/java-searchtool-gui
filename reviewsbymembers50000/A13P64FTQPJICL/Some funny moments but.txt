 ..not my first choice for a romantic comedy. Adam Sandler acts in his movies (that applies to Big Daddy too) as if he's Bruce Lee, who is afraid of no one, and could lift a mountain with one of his fingers. At least  that's what appears from his threatening tone when he speaks it (and he  does that a lot.) Pros: *Some parts are very funny(like Sandler's  version of Madonna's "Holiday"). Cons: *Those parts aren't  that much. *A lot of childish humor,especially near the end. Bottom  line:kind of enetertaining,especially the first half,but gets too emotional  and childish near the end.
