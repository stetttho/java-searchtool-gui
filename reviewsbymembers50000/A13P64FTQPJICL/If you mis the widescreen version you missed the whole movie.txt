 What a great movie this is.I enjoyed every second(I'm sure you will). Pros: *The movie is a visual masterpiece.The visual and sound FX are breath-taking. *Heart-stopping action. *Althouhg it's a sci-fi  movie,it actualy has a plot! *Brendan Fraser was terrific.I never though  he could be so. *Rachel Weisz was terrific too.Real eye candy. *Very  beautiful desert settings. *Fast and intense camera  movements. *Excellent score. *A super cool villain. *Definitely the  hottest and coolest extras you will ever find.In fact,the extras are enough  reason to buy this DVD. Cons: *Although Stephen Sommers did a better  job than any other director in trying to authenticate the Arabs,they  weren't 100%.There were some Lebanese accents in Egypt,and a lot of the  language isn't clear enough. *Some overacting in jokes,namely Rachel  Weisz's brother(in the movie). *Arabs are either:degenerate scum(the  prison warden),low wiesels(that mummy's sidekick),killers and a lot of  other negativities.
