 Warren Beatty is always terrific.His movies always have some kind of a seal-of-quality thing about them.The more Warren Beatty sticks his nose in a movie,the better that movie gets.So when you have a movie that is  directed,produced,starring and co-written by him,you're in for some REAL  fun. Pros: *Warrren Beatty was everything  imaginable:convincing,courageous,FUNNY(I mean,he was REALLY funny),cool and  hip,and everything you want. *Halle Berry was brilliant too. *Paul  Sorvino and Oliver Platt added even more excellence and humour. *The plot  and script were smart and well-written. *Everything screams  perfection:acting,plot,music,cinematography and even  backgrounds. Cons: *None,though I still didn't get the ending. The  bottomline:one of the coolest comedies in years and definitely THE finest  political comedy you could see.Do NOT miss it.
