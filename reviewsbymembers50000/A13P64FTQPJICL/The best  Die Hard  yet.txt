 What an adrenaline rush this movie is! Pros: *The mostexplosive part of the series. *Samuel L. Jackson was terrific. Hewas very funny, too. *Pretty creative plot. Smart twists. *Very funny sometimes. That part where Bruce Willis stands in the middle of Harem with that sign has to be one of the funniest moments in action film history! *Jeremy Irons was brilliant. So was Bruce Willis. *The action scenes (especially the explosions) are to die for. *There's something about the movie (I don't know what it is),but it makes it delightful to watch. Maybe because a lot of scenes were shot in a sunny day... Bottom line: excellent movie! This is action at its very best.
