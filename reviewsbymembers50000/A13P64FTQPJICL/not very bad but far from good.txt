 Pros: *Rob Schneider and Jon Stewart,though secondary,are very funny. *The kid was cute and convincing. Cons: *Very dramatic ending.If it were funny,it would've been better. *The jokes aren't  much. Bottomline:When I heard that it was a comedy that grossed about  150-60 million dollars,I thought that it could be just as funny as Kingpin  or Dumb&Dumber.If you're an Adam Sandler fan,it's good.Otherwise,if a  few laughs make a movie worth it to you,give it a rent in a boring weekend.
