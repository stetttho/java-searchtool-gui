 Edward Norton is brilliant.What else to you expect from him? Pros: *An extraordinarily brilliant performance by Norton(I say extraordinarily,because the performance was stunning,and not because Edward  is usually mediocre,of course).Personally,I think he's the best young actor  out there. *Daring and brave direction. Cons: *The movie,as a  whole,is so-so. The bottomline:Edward's performance is reason enough to  buy it.Unfortunately,he was snubbed at the Oscars.Edward:you don't need an  Oscar to be great.Just look at Martin Scorsese.
