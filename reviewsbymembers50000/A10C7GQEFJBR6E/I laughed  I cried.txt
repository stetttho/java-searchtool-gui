 This was a great book!  It has a variety of essays, focussing on the theme of motherhood.  I was very moved by some of them (Beth Kephart's essay about her son's efforts to play soccer; Ariel Gore's about being stuck in the hell that is family court), but also laughed at many places throughout.  The "Drama Queen for a Day" short essays were great for the title as well as content. I was also struck by the depth of emotion expressed by the authors.  Reading this book, I felt that it was telling the truth about being a mother; the emotion you feel towards your children is the strongest you'll ever experience.
