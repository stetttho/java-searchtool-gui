 I began this book, a collection of essays about people Orlean had interviewed, with enthusiasm, but finished it with relief.  The essays were well-written, but soon began to seem too much alike to be of great interest. I ended up skipping some that were not about subjects I found intrinsically interesting. Several of the essays date from the 1980s, and read as though they did.  For example, the author's observations regarding 1980s pop singer Tiffany seemed dated, in light of the current slick marketing of teen stars (or acts aimed at the teen market).  It would have been worth making some effort to update the stories, and place them in some kind of context.  Instead, this is just a collection of previously published pieces, not all of which should have been brought back to light.
