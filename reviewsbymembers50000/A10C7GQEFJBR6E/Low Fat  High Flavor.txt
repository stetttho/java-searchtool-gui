 This is a great cookbook.  First, it is a pleasure to look at, with gorgeous full-color pictures for every recipe.  It's easy to follow, with clear instructions and ingredient lists. Most importantly, the recipes work.  The recipe for sesame chicken with apricots and snow peas is fabulous, and there are many more that look equally wonderful. Although this is a cookbook with healthy recipes, some of them are a bit higher in fat.  The book notes that when you eat one of those, it's a good idea to balance out your diet with some lower-fat foods.  In general, though, this book gives you some great ideas for eating in a healthy way without sacrificing taste and pleasure in food.
