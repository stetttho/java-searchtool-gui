 I just reread this book for the first time in years, and couldn't put it down.  From the first page, Winsor grabs the reader and takes you on an extremely entertaining, fascinating journey through one woman's life against the backdrop of Restoration-era England.  Amber is far from a moral paragon, and makes foolish decisions, but her story is still gripping years after this book was written.  Other historical romances are pallid when compared with this vivid narrative.
