 I really enjoyed this clever, witty mystery, which was the first I've read by this author.  I was drawn to it at first by its setting in a discount mall, but soon found many other things to like- the characters, the clever one-liners, the discussion of suburbia and the importance of appearances and money in it, as well as the mystery itself. I love finding a "new" author who's written lots of other books- now I have the fun of going back and reading the first books in this series.
