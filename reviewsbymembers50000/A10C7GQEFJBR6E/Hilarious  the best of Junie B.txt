 My daughter and I have read all of the Junie B. Jones books, and this is one of the best- funny and on-target from start to finish.  When Junie B's parents tell her they have a suprise for her, she is disappointed to learn that it will be a new baby, and not a present.  Things worsen when mom won't accept Junie B's suggestions for names ("Teeny" being one of them, since the baby will be so small). But the trouble really begins when Junie B's grandma comes home from seeing the new arrival and refers to him as the "cutest little monkey" she's ever seen.  Junie B takes this literally, and goes to school insisting that her new brother is really a monkey.  Hilarity ensues- I couldn't stop laughing as my then first-grade daughter read it to me. In addition to the abundant humor, the book also shows that it is a confusing world out there, and that grownups' behavior is frequently inexplicable.  Young readers can identify with Junie B's efforts to navigate through the disappointments and challenges of family and school even as they are entertained by her. This is a great choice for kids who are just making the switch to chapter books. The chapters are short enough so that new readers will not be overwhelmed, and there are plenty of excellent illustrations to help kids interpret the text, and to provide additional humor.
