 because I was so irritated by it I wanted it to be done.  I've read, and enjoyed, the previous books in this series. (Although it's true that the last couple were already getting too repetitive). In fact, I've been enough of a fan to buy the first few books for friends as gifts, so I could expose them to this really fun series.  Unfortunately, this one was a huge disappointment.  It was a series of vignettes demonstrating the "heroine's" utter foolishness.  Given how she was presented in this book, it was hard for me to understand why the 2 men, Ranger and Joe, would constantly be knocking thenselves out for her. I would think they'd want to run in the other direction.   The characters have become caricatures, the humor mere slapstick, and the plot arbitrary.  I can understand that after so many books about the same characters, the very gifted author would be running out of ideas; I guess the publisher wants more of these books, because they are so successful, but I think it's time to gracefully retire Miss Stephanie.
