 I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book, as I had not cared much for previous books by this author.  But I found it to be a very entertaining, often humorous novel that was fun to read.  The characters are largely rich, beautiful, shallow, and not too bright, enabling the reader to feel both envious and superior at the same time. Considered on its own terms, as mindless summer escapism, this was a good book.
