 What a nice book!  Nothing earthshaking or experimental, just a story about several people moving through life, making connections with each other, and finding happiness after loss and disappointment.   Yes, the characters and plot are at times predictable, and not always entirely sympathetic, but they were basically believable, and certainly held my interest.  It struck me as somewhat old-fashioned, but I found it soothing.  Not something you'd write a dissertation about, but perfect for a vacation.
