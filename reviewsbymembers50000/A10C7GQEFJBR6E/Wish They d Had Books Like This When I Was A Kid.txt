 This slim book is packed with information about France- its history, language, and what it's like to live there.  It's a great way to satisfy, or stimulate, a child's curiousity about faraway places.  The illustrations are colorful, and yet not too cluttered to be informative.  The descriptions are clearly written, with nice big print, but with enough detail to have educational value.  I recommend it for grade-schoolers, who have any interest, or who need to learn about, life in France. One deficiency: Since I don't speak French, I can't help my daughter with pronunciation, which is so important.  Although some of the pages include transliterations of the French phrases, not all of them do.  It would be helpful if they did.
