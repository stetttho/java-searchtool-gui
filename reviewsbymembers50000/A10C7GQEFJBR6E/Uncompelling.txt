 This book is about three women; teenager Ruth, her 40-something mother Carrie, and Carrie's mother Dana.  According to its back cover, Carrie is "struggling" to recover after the death of her husband.  But I didn't find that to be true at all.  It's true, that after her husband dies, Carrie become lethargic and depressed.  She neglects her daughter, and focusses only on herself, even though she did not have a very good relationship with her dead husband, and her daughter could have used some support from her mom.  I found Carrie incredibly unsympathetic, particularly when, after the auhor has decided to get Carrie out of the house, a relationship with the perfect man, and work opportunities, just fall into this unappealing character's lap.  There was no struggle, growth, or change that I could see in this character.  I also thought the character of the mother, Dana, was depressing.  Her attempts to change her marriage, and other aspects of her life, were futile. Nevertheless, it gets three stars because some of the other characters, particularly the lesser ones, are better drawn, and although the plotting was weak the dialogue and other aspects of the writing were OK.
