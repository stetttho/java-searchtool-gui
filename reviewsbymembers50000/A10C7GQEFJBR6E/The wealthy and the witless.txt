 As I read this book, a thought kept recurring- can't these people come up with anything better to do with their time?  Kessler writes about a group of people who have all the money and all the time anyone could want, but choose to spend their lives hanging out at (anti-seimitic) private clubs and attending charity balls that don't actually raise all that much for charity, once the enormous expenses are deducted from the money taken in.  According to Kessler, Palm Beach is populated by women who want nothing more than to snag a rich man, and men who reaffirm their youth and masculinity by getting involved with much younger women. When a more decent person did turn up, I wondered what they were doing there.  Even after reading this book, I can't figure out the alleged attraction of Palm Beach.   The book was repetitive and disorganized, and I was ready for it to end, but it does provide a glimpse (and I have no idea how accurate it is) into a world I will thankfully never be a part of.
