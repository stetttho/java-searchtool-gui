 What a joy it is to sink into a Barbara Pym novel, especially this one, which is one of my favorites.  The eye for detail, the wit, the ability to sketch a character with just a sentence or two, that this author possesses, never fail to delight.  I return to her novels every couple of years, and find them to be balm for the soul. This trip into the English countryside of 50 years ago, with its vicars, teas, and rationing, is a gentle and wondrous escape from current realities. Yet, like all great literature, its insights into human nature is timeless.
