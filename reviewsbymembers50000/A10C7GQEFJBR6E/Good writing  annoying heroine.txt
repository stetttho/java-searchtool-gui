 I've always enjoyed Witchel's writing in the New York Times, and was intrigued to see she'd written a book (apparently not her first, but I didn't know about the other one).  As I expected, the writing in this one was clever and literate, and carried me along smoothly through the somewhat predictable plot. The book describes what happens to the heroine, Sandy, after she discovered that her fiance was involved, and even engaged to, other women. Although it's a terrrible shock, she eventually matures as a result of the experience.  The problem with this type of book, and I've read many of them lately, is that the heroine is so annoyingly lacking in insight and maturity to begin with that it's hard to cheer her on.  And when things (i.e., men), finally start to work out for her, it's hard to figure out why things should now be going her way.   But, as a former New Yorker and frequent reader of magazines, I really enjoyed all of the New York scenes and the look at life working at a fashion magazine.  I got a kick out of the character of Sandra's boss- a woman more concerned with her own ego, and with putting other people down, than with what was really best for the magazine.  (A kind of boss not confined to fashion magazines, unfortunately). Given Witchel's background, and the circles in which she undoubtedly moves, I felt that I was getting a real insider's look at life in certain segments of the big city.
