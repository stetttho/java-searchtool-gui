 John O'Brien wasn't a strong writer, and he frequently loses control of this narrative. For example, he does strange things like assumes the point of view of a refrigerator ... but doesn't do anything with that. He's not really in control of his language, either -- grabbing words that seem out of context, e.g., "redolent of his prescience" instead of a straightforward "suggestive of his foresight," which would've fit better with his own rhetorical choices earlier in the novel. Some of the sex scenes with Sera also seem to betray a sexual aggression on the part of the narrator, which is weirdly blind for this narrator considering just how omniscient this narrator is in other places ... Nonetheless, these flaws may make the story easier to take. A perfect execution of this story may have been too dark. Instead, the flaws humanize the story (which is powerful) and the characters and make it a compelling read.
