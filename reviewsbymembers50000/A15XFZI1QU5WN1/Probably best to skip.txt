 Alan Singer's novel focuses on what it means to have a body and what it means to have a consciousness and what it means to have a memory at a very involved philosophical level. These ideas are more dramatized than explained, which makes it a little hard to understand. Plus, he filters all these dramatized theories through his own complex theories about prose and fiction, which focus on rhetorical complexity in lieu of plot complexity and things of this nature. If you're absolutely blown away by the concept that people think, that people really, actually cogitate despite the fact that their consciousnesses are located in bodies, then you may just love this work. If not, that is, you believe in an eternal soul and/or otherwise think that the mind and body are not the same thing (or if you don't care one way or the other)you may want to take a pass because this work's philosophical underpinnings may not resonate much with you.
