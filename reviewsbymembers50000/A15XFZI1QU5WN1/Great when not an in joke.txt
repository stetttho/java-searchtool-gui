 First three-quarters of the book are great. The prose was pitch-perfect, the composition and literary technique masterful, the narrator self-aware and reader-involving. An absorbing, fascinating read.  Then the book got a bit repetitious. Some material went over my head. Other stuff seemed to be an "in" joke between Sorrentino and his friends. By the end I was relieved. Still, if you like heavily literary fiction with a strong sense of humor about others', and its own, pretensions, you'll enjoy this minor masterpiece.
