  The plot arc: Spoiled rich kid with tough-guy attitude and severe alcoholism/crack addiction has his parents pay for a stay at the exclusive Hazelden clinic in Minnesota.  Goes in a busted-up, addicted idiot.  Comes out a semi-repaired, sober jerk.  In fairness to him, he's still in early sobriety when he leaves, and he's still young. But when he leaves the clinic doors he's determined not to learn anything from anyone.  He forgets that "self-made men are self-evident".   Those criticisms aside, James Frey's book has its moments. Some of the writing is beautiful, particularly when there are fewer I's jumping out at you.  The story itself is easy to read and has a voyeuristic quality to it some readers will like.  There are some interesting characters he meets.  I found myself skimming a lot by the middle of the book because of its repetitiousness. The ending is very formulaic and his last gesture probably seems different to those around him than it did to him. That is, it was melodramatic silliness.  For a guy with supposed ruthless honesty, he's remarkably sentimental.  This is a worthwhile read.  But it's not the War and Peace of addiction, as it says on the back cover...
