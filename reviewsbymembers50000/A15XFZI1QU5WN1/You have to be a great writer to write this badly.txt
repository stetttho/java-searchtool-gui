 Read this book just to see how a terrible, pretentious little author could one day grow up to be the great John Updike. Astonishingly bad ... and that's working with a pretty cool story. Yes, Rabbit Angstrom is a hateful, inconsiderate little twerp ... but it's a story worth hearing. How the story's told, though, the language, the writing is so awful it cannot be parodied effectively. For example, this book contains what must be the worst English sentence ever written. Updike, describing the conclusion of a sex act, says, "His sea of seed buckles and sobs into a still chamber." Oh dear. And yes, the author became a titan. Go figure.
