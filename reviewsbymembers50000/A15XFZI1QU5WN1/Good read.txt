 This book is a great way spend an afternoon.  What works about it? The character of Nanny, the narrator. She's wonderful and I think most people could listen to her tell stories all day. Her observations seem sharp, she cares about people (and makes you care about them, too), and she's funny. What's ambiguous: The ending is either problematic or interesting and realistic, depending on your point of view. As a reader, you're left wishing for one more scene, but Nanny doesn't get to see that scene, so I guess we don't, either.  What doesn't work as well: The prose seems hyper-edited and air-brushed. The result is a little anti-septic. It's obvious the publisher didn't trust these first-time novelists' natural style. Maybe that was a good call, but the result is the reader may hear a NY editor's talking over the authors' voice at times. That is, I've read this same style a dozen times in the last few years from a variety of authors. Next time, editors, let the authors flex their literary muscles a little.  And even though it's hyper-edited, it's not necessarily well-edited. There's some weird paragraphing that starts to look like point-of-view errors. In any case, it's confusing at times, whereas if the prose had been allowed to breathe a little, it might have been less confusing and more interesting.
