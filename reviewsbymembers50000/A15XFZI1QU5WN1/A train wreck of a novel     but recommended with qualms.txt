 If you like the narrator's sense of humor and can identify with some of these characters, you'll really enjoy this book.  If you don't, you'll most likely be horrified ... For about 150 pages I thought this was the worst writing I'd ever read. However, there was a consistent voice, albeit one that seemed to make the wrong rhetorical choices every time.  Specifically, he makes judgments about things that he hasn't explained fully, so you're supposed to take his word for a lot of things [and you don't], and he says a lot of things not because they mean anything but because he likes how they sound. This is usually called babbling and children/immature adults do it. His thoughts were also loaded with cliches about Kerouac and Hunter Thompson. There were no characters ... just impulses. I began to anything this relentlessly out of touch with how it would be perceived had to be a big gag. So I kept reading. And there was a reward for the effort: About half way through, the narrator changes. He goes from being a collection of cliches/desires/impulses to an actual human being. Not a nice person at first, but hey, you can tell he's trying to become a man. The immature jokiness slowed, the cliched descriptions and inflated language eased up ... he became a more straightforward teller of his story and clearly he'd begun to absorb the lessons of his suffering. There were some moments of delicious irony in the later sections and some outstanding sentences. (I thought the ending was a bit of a cop-out -- the narrator was progressing ... he just didn't quite know it yet.) The book itself turned out not to be a long gag, but a bildingsroman. It is to some extent a necessary novel, too...there are people like this, and this book helps render them understandable.  Also check out Knut Hamsun's Hunger, Christopher Isherwood's Goodbye to Berlin, Nelson Algren's Somebody in Boots and Charles Jackson's The Lost Weekend for this kind of material handled by masterful writers.
