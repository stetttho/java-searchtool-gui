 This is a remarkable book. While I thought the prose was uneven ... at times outstanding, at times merely recondite (that's one of Dahlberg's words) and at times strange, the underlying story is one of the most moving and beautiful around.  The source of the beauty may be its honesty. Dahlberg  refuses to be a victim or hate people who've done horrible things to him. (He's no chump, either.) It's a tough read, and you may need a dictionary on hand (I did), but a worthwhile experience.
