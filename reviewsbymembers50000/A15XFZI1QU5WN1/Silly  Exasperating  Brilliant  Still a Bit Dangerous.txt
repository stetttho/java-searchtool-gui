 Henry Miller wrote a lot of books ... but they are all essentially the same, about Henry. An ex- of mine once said she wasn't sure if HM stood for Henry Miller or His Majesty.  Like all Miller's novels, the book contains some brilliant passages, but you'll have to slog through a lot ... a lot ... of self-absorbed ramblings before you get to them. But it's worth it just for the section of Van Norden's wanting to write something completely original, and Henry's missing of his wife. These sections are profound and true and wonderful and beautifully rendered. There's other good stuff, too, here and there.  Now, the dangerous part. Henry Miller made it fashionable to think you can be a bum/borderline sociopath, make fun of friends off of whom you live for your daily bread, avoid responsibilities and duties, and then publish self-indulgent ridicule about your dissolute lifestyle and derision of others and call it art. Fortunately, Henry was honest and talented enough at times to pull it off. And at times his writing raises to the levels of greatness.  But he kicked off a school of writing that has been the destruction of more than one good writer. Another novel written at the same time, and covering much of the same material (indulgent, pleasure-seeking expatriate meeting up with all levels of a society in crisis), is Christopher Isherwood's Good-bye to Berlin. (It's like, hey, Henry, did you even notice that at the time you were muttering about blowing up the world, the country next door was electing a madman who would try to do just that.) The difference is Isherwood is a masterful writer and artist, and manages to artfully play off his self-absorption so that the reader isn't immersed in it, like in Henry Miller. Isherwood also has class. (Isherwood's Down There On a Visit also covers a lot of similar ground, just better.)
