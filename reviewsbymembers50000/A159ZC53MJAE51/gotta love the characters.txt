 I fell in love with these characters. I can honestly say that. Travis Thrasher made these characters come alive and made you feel like you knew them. He made you feel what they were feeling. It was almost cruel the way that Travis Thrasher played with my emotions in this book. Some parts you're like "oh! that's so sad!" Other times you're cheering the characters on, but every once in awhile I found myself screaming with frustration at the characters! I loved the whole story plot, I loved the character development, I loved the things I learned from reading the book, but most of all I absolutely loved and adored the ending! My only problem with the book is that I would have liked a earlier description of what Ethan(one of the main characters) looked like. You don't know what color his hair is until about 40 pages away from the end. But what's weird is that the author did such a good job of making you know Ethan so well (but not well enough that he doesn't keep you guessing)that you can tell what color hair he has. If you don't want to know what color hair he has then don't read the next sentence, but if you want to know so you don't have to read the whole book to find out then read the next sentence. I knew that he had golden brown hair. It was just Ethan. That's what's him. I'm sorry this is long. Read the book! It's great!
