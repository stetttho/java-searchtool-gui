 How can I describe how much I enjoyed this book? I absolutely loved the ending, I was REALLY near to crying.  I got so involved in this book that I found that I was praying for the characters, especially Shiloh. I'm soooooo glad that the authors are continuing the series!  thank you, thank you, thank you! I can't write anything else, otherwise I'll give something away, and I hate it when people do that.  All I can say is read the series!  Excellent job Gilbert and Lynn Morris!
