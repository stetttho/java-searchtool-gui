 The Indwelling is the seventh book for the Left Behind series and it is absolutely overwhelming in the excellence of the writing of this book. The authors keep you turning pages throughout the entire book. There isn't one  single boring part in this book. You will not be disapointed with the   continuation of Assassins. You finally find out who killed Carpathia, and  what is happening with the dangerous situations the characters that watched  the assassination.  I eagerly wait for the next book, The Mark, coming out  on Nov. 14 this year.
