 This is the book that made me love Karen Kingsbury's books.  I had never read any of her books before, and, to be perfectly honest, the only reason I wanted to read her books was because the covers looked awesome.  I was soon to be going on a trip and I needed to "re-stock" on my books so I could read in the car(yes, my family was driving).  I decided to give Mrs. Kingsbury a try.  After I read the back of her books I decided on A Time to Dance.  It sounded like it had a good story line and wasn't like the fluffy, don't-have-to-think-just-read type book.  Boy, was I in for a treat.  This book forces you to think about your life in a different view.  I talked so much with God while I was reading A Time to Dance.  Mrs. Kingsbury does an excellent job getting you to become familiar with the characters, to the point where you hurt when they hurt and wish you could be there to give them advice and talk to them.  I just finished A Moment of Weakness a few days ago and it's just as good as A Time to Dance.  I really encourage you to try Karen Kingsbury.  You'll be surprised how much you enjoy her work.
