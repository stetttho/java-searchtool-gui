 Riders of the Silver Rim was entertaining and at some parts suspenseful, but i've also read Bodie Thoene's ZION COVENANT, ZION CHRONICLES, and SHILOH LEGACY. Riders of the Silver Rim could have been so much better if  the plot had been more developed. The book seemed too rushed. One page  something drastic happens and then you turn the page and it ends. The main  plot was interesting to read, but(like i said)if it had been more developed  it would have been a really great plot. Besides this, the book was fun to  read and it makes you laugh and cry at the same time. Bodie Thoene you're  doing an awesome job!
