 When I first started reading this book I thought it was good and interesting, but nothing major was really happening. Then about 3/4 of the way through I was completely shocked at the turn of events. I just sat there staring at the pages in complete disbelief that this author had the courage to do something this extreme and drastic. Now, obviously I can't tell you what she did, but I can tell you that it will make your eyes glued to the pages until the end of the book. This is an awesome series to read. I just started the fourth book and the plot makes your heart race starting from the first few pages. You won't regret reading this series.
