 I was a little disappointed with the plot of this book. I felt that Linda Chaikin could have done better. But I did love the very intriguing twist with the characters. Mrs.Chaikin has never interwoven her characters from others book series into others. I don't want to give away anything though so I'll keep quiet. All of you Linda Chaikin fans out there should read this book because I'm sure that you'll love it and find some parts to be very interesting(You'll understand once you've read it! I can't give away anything!).
