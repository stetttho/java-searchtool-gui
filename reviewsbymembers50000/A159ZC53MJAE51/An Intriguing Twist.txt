 First of all, I've read the Heart of India series 4 times so I know that when I say that this is an amazing series you can trust me. If you have never read any of Linda Chaikin's books this is the one to start with. I give this book to my friends who are looking for a good read. The biggest complaint about this book that I've heard is that the beginning is kind of slow. Once I read the rest of Chaikin's books I agreed, but if you read this book first you won't even notice that it's a little slow because you'll be so wrapped up in the adventure, mystery, and intrigue. This book takes place in 18th century India. Chaikin did a remarkable job in describing the Hindu culture and the tension between them and the English who live in India, like the main characters, Coral Kendall and Jace Buckley. Chaikin also puts hisorical characters into her books, such as William Carey and John Newton (the man who wrote "Amazing Grace.")Please take my advice and read this book series. You won't regret it.
