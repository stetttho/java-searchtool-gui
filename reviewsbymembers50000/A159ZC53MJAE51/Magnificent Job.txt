 Tuesday's Child was a great book! i have read all of linda chaikin's books and this is one of the best! it has mystery, espionage, ballets, and romance. the characters are described very well and you feel like you know  them by the end of the book. the historical accuracy of this book is also  very well done, which the book takes place during the time when Hitler is  getting ready to invade France. the ballet in the book is very well  described and you can abviously tell that linda chaikin had to research a  lot on it to give such a detailed explaination of it. i thoroughly enjoyed  reading this book! i couldn't put it down! thanks linda chaikin! get up the  good work!
