 I was really looking forward to this book coming out ever since I read the first in the series. However, I'm sorry to say that while I'm pleased with the story line and the "courtroom drama" part of the book, I'm extrememly disappointed with the depth of the characters. I felt like I had missed a huge step in the relationship between Kit Shannon and Ted Fox. There wasn't the normal feeling of knowing the characters and feeling emotions along with them. You almost don't have any reaction to situations in the book that should have effects like shock, hurt, joy, and torn feelings. Instead, you're left saying, "Okay, when did this develop?" I felt like I had been left out of a big part in the characters lives in the beginning of the book and that ended up ruining the rest of my emotions and perspective on the characters for the rest of the story. Now that I've completely bashed the character relations, I can say that the actual storyline is very interesting and suspenseful. Kit Shannon always keeps you guessing as to how she's going to prove this or get out of that. If you've already read City of Angels, then you must read Angels Flight just because of the whole courtroom message.
