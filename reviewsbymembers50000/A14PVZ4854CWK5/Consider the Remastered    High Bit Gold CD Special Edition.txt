 This 1991 3-disc standard set is undoubtedly a fine edition of the Amadeus soundtrack with its unique and oversized packaging, but for serious listening, you should consider the '24 High-Bit' Gold CD remastered special edition issued in 2002 (ASIN: B00005Y1SV), notwithstanding that it does cost slightly more.  The original soundtrack has been remastered for excellent sonics in that special edition, and I believe the included 30-page booklet has been updated as well.  Although there are only 2 discs in the remastered edition, each 24K Gold disc is jam-packed with music to the brim, such that the special edition set of 2 discs actually contains all 30 tracks of this 3-disc standard edition.    Anyway, if you enjoyed Amadeus, you can't go wrong with either edition, as each will deliver many hours of listening pleasure.
