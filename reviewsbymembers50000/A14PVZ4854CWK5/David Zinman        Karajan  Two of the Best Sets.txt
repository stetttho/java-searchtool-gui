 I have 3 different Beethoven Nine Symphonies sets now:   (1) 'The Beethoven Collection' by Janos Ferencsik (ASIN: B000001VVY) (2) 'Beethoven: The Nine Symphonies' by David Zinman (ASIN: B00000IFP6) (3) 'Beethoven: 9 Symphonien' by Herbert von Karajan (ASIN: B000001GBQ).  The first one is a budget set and has taken early retirement since I acquired the latter two, which I found to be far superior.  Yet, there is a difference between the latter two.  The critically acclaimed David Zinman edition is slightly lightweight, but has the advantage of speed and dramatics and really grabs your attention.  For those times when I feel bored and need something exciting to perk me up, that's when I reach for the David Zinman edition.  It is Beethoven driven at a very fast pace, as mentioned by numerous others earlier.  The widely acknowledged 1963 Herbert von Karajan edition has a large grand orchestral sound which is warm and lush; I reach for it when I want to unwind and enjoy sweet orchestral music.  The quality of the recording is still excellent despite its age, and if you are coming over to classical music from smooth Jazz, this is an easier transition.  I strongly recommend these 2 sets - if you like your Symphonies hot and exciting go for the Zinman edition; if you want something warm and lush, go for the 1963 Karajan edition, or better still, grab both sets like me.
