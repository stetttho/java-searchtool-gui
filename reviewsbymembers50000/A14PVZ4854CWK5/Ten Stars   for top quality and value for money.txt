 These 2 cds are mp3 versions of an 8 audio cd set "Paul Mauriat and His Orchestra Deluxe Collection (2004)".  The 8 audio cds themselves contain 2 albums each, for a total of 16 albums, all recorded between 1966 to 1972, the golden years of the Paul Mauriat Orchestra.  The 8 audio cds set are also available with these 2 mp3 cds thrown in for free, but it does cost three times more.   These 2 mp3 cds contain all 16 hit albums as claimed: 1. Listen to Paul Mauriat [1966] 2. Paul Mauriat-World Top Hits [1967] 3. La Reine De Saba [1968] 4. Une Larme Aux Nuages [1968] 5. Le Temps Des Fleurs [1969] 6. Rhythm & Blues [1969] 7. Aquarius [1969] 8. Isadora [1970] 9. Le Passager De La Pluie [1970] 10. Paul Mauriat Plays Love Theme [1971] 11. Penelope [1971] 12. Tombe La Neige [1971] 13. Mamy Blue [1971] 14. Godfather [1972] 15. Last Summer Day [1972] and 16. Il Y A Du Soleil Sur La France [1972].    Cd No. 1 with 115 tracks clocked in at 5 hours and 15 minutes while Cd No. 2 with 98 tracks clocked in at 4 hours and 44 minutes, giving a staggering 10 hours of pure Paul Mauriat orchestral delight.  The mp3 tracks are easily accessible and playable on any computer or mp3 supported cd/dvd players, and fortunately they were all encoded at a high bit-rate of 256kbs, so they sound excellent even if you decide to reconvert them back to audio cd format for playback on your hi-fi set.  Both these 2 mp3 cds as well as the 8 audio cds were factory manufactured in Russia in 2004 (definitely not bootleg cd-r copies) and fully deserve their labels as collector's items that belong on the shelf of any Paul Mauriat fan.  If they have gone out of stock, you should periodically check back for their return or rarecds.us may prove fruitful for you.  In short, if you are a Paul Mauriat fan, you will not want to miss this opportunity of acquiring 16 of his albums at such a fantastic bargain!
