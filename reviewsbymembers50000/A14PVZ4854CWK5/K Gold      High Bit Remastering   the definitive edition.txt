 There are several different editions of Amadeus soundtracks ranging from single-disc to 3-disc sets available all at the same time, and it can be quite confusing at first.  After some research I ended up debating on whether to get the cheaper 1991 3-disc standard edition (ASIN: B000000XBV) or this 2002 2-disc special edition with '24 High-Bit' remastering.  I had initial doubts that the latter contain the same 30 tracks, since it is only a 2-disc set, and decided to take a chance only after visiting the label site to confirm that it contains all 30 tracks as well.  Just a few days ago, it arrived from Amazon in a double-cd jewel case with a 30-page well-designed booklet, which has the movie sypnosis, individual narratives of almost all tracks, 2 articles about the movie and interspersed throughout with colourful scenes from the movie.  I discovered that the two '24K Gold' cds are able to contain the same number of tracks as the 3-disc standard edition because each disc is literally jam-packed to the brim, at 78.07 and 79.28 minutes respectively!    Due to the new '24 High-Bit' remastering, the sonic quality is excellent and perhaps die-hard fans of the earlier standard edition may even want to include this in their collection as well.  For those who are thinking of owning only one edition, this is the definitive edition to get if you really enjoyed the music in Amadeus and want the very best quality possible.
