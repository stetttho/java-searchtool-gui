 I read "The Broker" fast and it is full of suspense. And this time, Grisham is delivering an international suspense thriller, which he's quite good in writing. It's all about a Washington power broker (not a stock broker as the title may lead you believe) who's released from prison under a special deal. The CIA gives him (the power broker) a new identity, etc. relocates him to Italy. Nice scenery and details about Italian life. Now, the power broker is a target to his previous "clients" from the Russians to the shady middle eastern characters to whom he had sold U.S. secrets during his "good" old days. The Broker reminds me a little bit on the in 2000 published novel by Alec Donzi "The Consultant" which is along similar lines and also an exceptional international thriller. Both books are excellent reads -- and with "The Broker" the real Grisham is back in a powerful way.
