 Until a few weeks ago, I had not heard of Radney Foster, but then I saw the "Everyday Angel" video from his 2002 released CD "Another Way To Go". Then as I wanted his CDs immediately I was trying to find some of his CDs in the local stores here in Las Vegas, but nobody had a CD stocked, and I was just glad that Amazon.com had them in stock and offered his CDs at a discount price. Anyway, I was positively surprised to find all these rare gems throughout this CD. "Are You Ready for the Big Show?" is a relaxing album with great ballads which have country undertones seasoned with some R&B. It sounds like it that Radney had a blast in recording this CD. Several songs are definitely songs that are a Must-Have in every CD collection, especially "I'm Used To It" and the Foster classic "Folding Money." But there are also great songs like "School of Hard Knocks" and "Nobody Wins" and "God Knows When." This CD offers over 1 hour of original music! Despite so much talent out there, it is very hard to find quality singer/songwriters like Radney Foster. As funny as it is, sometimes Foster reminds me lightly of Bob Dylan and then again here and there of Van Morrison, but of course he has established his own distinguished voice. Don't expect polished commercial country junk, but great arrangements with a slight rough edge to it. Definitely an excellent CD!
