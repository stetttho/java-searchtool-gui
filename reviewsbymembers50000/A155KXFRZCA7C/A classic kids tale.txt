 I was a kid when I first saw Chitty Chitty Bang Bang during its first release in the cinemas, and I loved that movie ever since. My kids went through 3 Video copies over the years as they liked it a lot, and I'm glad that we have it now on DVD. The story is about that poverty-stricken inventor (Dick Van Dyke) who comes across this old car and turns it into the flying miracle car Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. He also has two kids and together with a female acquaintance who's concerned about the welfare of his children, they engage in a wild journey as the flying car takes them to a far-away fairy-tale country, with Schloss Schwanstein (in Bavaria) at the center. The king and the queen in this country don't like kids, so the two kids are kidnapped. Overall, this is a fantastic family movie with lots of fun, fantasy, adventure, music and family entertainment.
