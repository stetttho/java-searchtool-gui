 This film is a completely different take on Batman. As a kid, Batman was my favorite hero in the comics and ever since, all things Batman were cool. I was surprised by the approach the director took on Batman Begins, and I'm sure it was a very difficult execution, but superb craftsmanship and originality bring this Batman very lively unto the screen, although he's humanized and the origins of his "powers" are explained. It didn't hurt to see familiar movie legend faces such as Liam Neeson, Michael Caine (he's everywhere these days, but that's fine), Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer (from e.g. Bladerunner ... and in a sense this motion picture reminded me a little bit of Balderunner in some scenes). The twist of the story is very interesting and my 11+ year old said that it was a cool movie and he found it a little scary at times. There's plenty of action and it's the least cheesy Batman film ever made so far. In this film you learn about the humanity of Batman, although we all know it's a fictional character, but it's interesting to say the least. Bottom line, it's well worth watching Batman Begins and this flick has an edge to it and it is more serious and darker than the previous takes on this comic book hero.
