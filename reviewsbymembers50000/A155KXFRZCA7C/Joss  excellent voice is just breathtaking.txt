 Now with her own compositions and arrangements at the tender age of not even 18, this CD "Mind, Body & Soul" is certainly a phenomenal accomplishment. And nobody says that this has to be a perfect cut whatever that may mean anyway as music is subjective: you either like it or you don't. Ever since I saw a Joss Stone stage performance, this is just an exceptional musical experience that I'll never forget. The energy, her smokey voice, the musical arrangements, her stage presence, artistry, and professionalism with esprit. It's so rare these days to find talent like this. Someone can only imagine what Joss is going to deliver in a few years -- it's going to be awesome as the musical experience is already breathtaking now. Maybe not every song on this CD is really over the top, and that's why someone may give it only 3-4 stars, but just listening to her voice is a privilege, and that's why this CD once again just like her debut CD is a "must" in every CD collection.
