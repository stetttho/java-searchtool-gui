 At first when I listened to the 30-sec. song samples, I couldn't really figure out what this CD or for that matter Robinella & The CC Stringband is all about. Yes, I saw the "Man Over" video and that was cool, but what about the rest of the CD? Well, I finally spent the few bucks and it is really money well spent! And it is an exceptional album--you've got to listen to it several times to get all the details and the most excellent arrangements. Robinella's voice range of course is superbly represented on this CD. Every song is creative with a bluegrass/newgrass and alt-country undertone, supported by fiddles and dobros, etc., but there's also this touch of blues, jazz, cajun and even gospel which spices up the whole CD and makes it an interesting and pleasant musical work of art. And just like the "Man Over" video brings out, this music is fun and far away from the usual commercial junk. Great job, Robinella & CC SB.
