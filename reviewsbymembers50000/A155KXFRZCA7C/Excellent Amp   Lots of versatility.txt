 If you ever wanted your lead guitar sound like Carlos Santana, then this is the amp to get as close to Santana's characteristics as possible. The Tech 21 Trademark 60 is a high-quality amp that provides you the opportunity to sound like a lot of different amps depending on your needs. You will get a lot of cool sounds out of it, or just play it straight and simple and it becomes a powerhouse. For live shows you need to make sure to get the Extension cabinet for an extra 60 watts of power. For the studio you'll appreciate the from-amp-to-board feature on the amp as you won't lose the particular sound settings as you record directly into your computer or a multi-track recorder. The Trademark 60 is a sturdy amp that is light weight and it is solid. It's only a few bucks more than competitive amps, but I think the quality of the Tech 21 is truly exceptional.
