 With this film, Christmas has officially started. This flick is a first-class CGI animation adventure. The story, for those who don't know, is about a boy who has somewhat lost the magic of believing in Santa Claus and is dreaming of visiting the North Pole to find out. On Christmas eve the magical "Polar Express" stops in front of his house and invites him to join the ride to the North Pole. The journey is fantastic and often it feels like a roller coaster going up and down step scenic mountains over a frozen lake, etc. to the final destination of the city of North Pole where elfs and Santa reside working around the clock to get everything ready for Christmas. The story also involves various characters from the lonely outcast boy to the caring little girl to the selfish little brat and so on. It's a relaxing Christmas adventure for the whole family with lots of drama,but with happy endings. Take your kids to see this film as it will get you into the Christmas mood. This movie is extremely well done and may become a classic in more than one way.
