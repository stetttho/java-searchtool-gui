 If you're not familiar with Lucinda Williams, it may take a few listenings to get used to her style, but once you "discover" her, she's pure Alt-Country as it comes. She's an excellent songwriter and I like the way her CDs are recorded: the first take from her band is the final take--that's why at times it seems a little rough here and there, but that's what I like and it fits her style. This album features nice ballads and yes, Lucinda is even raping on a couple of songs. And the edgy "Real Live bleeding fingers and broken guitar strings" gets you going after the beautiful "Ventura." "Those three days" is a thoughtful song, but I didn't like the use of a four-letter word twice which was unnecessary and the only incident in this regard throughout the CD. Also the "American Dream" is an interesting take. To some degree there's a negative undertone on this CD, which cannot be taken that serious, and which is balanced by the soulful ballads. It's an artsy CD and it is quite interesting.
