 In a sense Cascada's sound is a throwback to the Disco era, but it's done in a very amicable fashion. It's actually cool music adopted in a style for our time. I know there are lots of Cascada fans in the U.S. as well as in Europe and it's just a matter of time til' Japan and Asia discover the Cascada sound. The "Everytime We Touch" mixes are really relaxing and "Miracle" is great as are the new other mixes. Don't think of this CD as high artistry or singer/songwriter super talent, but instead it is for this type of music what it is, it is fine dance music to relax and in this category it is very well done as it's fun to listen to.
