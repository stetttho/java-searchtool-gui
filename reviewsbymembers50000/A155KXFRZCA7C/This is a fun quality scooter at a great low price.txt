 My 6-year old bugged me day and night about a scooter, but a hundred bucks was just too much money for a scooter. So, I was very happy when the Stinger Scooter came along. My boy has a lot of fun with it. Yeah, maybe it's not as trendy as the Razor, but the Stinger is only fourty bucks and it fulfills the purpose. It appears to be very durable as my older kids did several jump tricks with it and it survived without a dent. The difference between the Razor and the Stinger aside from the low price for the Stinger is that the Razor is made out of aluminium/alloy while the Stinger is a sturdy steel construction. The weight is virtually the same, in fact the Stinger is even a little lighter than the Razor, which gives the Stinger even an advantage for tricks but also for smaller kids. For the trendy aspect, older teenagers and adults may opt for the Razor, but for kids and even younger teenagers the Stinger is certainly the appropriate choice and it looks cool, drives great and seems to be of durable quality.
