 It's rare to find good songwriting, singing and musical arrangements in our day and age, especially when it comes to a complete CD full of great songs. James Blunt won't be a one-hit wonder, instead I think he'll be around for a very long time. After listening through this CD you only have one desire: I wanna hear more. The CD has 10 songs and each one is superbly crafted -- almost haunting with chills running down your spine at times. When I heard a few seconds of "You're Beautiful" on TV I knew I had to get this CD. Most certainly I would have given the CD 5 stars, but the whole package is important to me and the cover art has to be good too ... and that's where the problem is as it communicates some sort of philosophy (which is absolutely unnecessary) and a philosophy I don't agree with. Also the cover reminds us apparently intentionally on Jim Morrison -- and in some of the songs some comparisons are in place. Anyway, one ballad after another, James Blunt does an excellent job. The musical arrangements are done with "less is more" in mind and these are superbly crafted ... an emphasis on a guitar here, on an organ there and a piano in another song -- excellent arrangements.
