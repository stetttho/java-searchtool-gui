 If you're still living in the stone age of Windows 95, then you must get Windows ME right now. The difference is virtually day and night. And for users of Windows 98 the upgrade is still helpful while at first there seems to be not that much of a difference. But Windows ME has some subtle features that I don't want to live without, like e.g. the automatic update feature that alerts you of updates and upgrades. Then there is the Windows Media Player which has excellent sound and video capabilities, which is almost a necessity in our day and age. The only difficulty we experienced so far, only occasionally though, is with the printing of E-mail notices which indicates an error message at times, but while we haven't figured out the problem yet we found a temporary solution to it. Overall, we can't give this upgrade 5 stars, because it's not as radical with super features that you may expect, but Windows ME has features you don't want to live without. Also, the operating system seems to be very stable without a freeze since installed, which wasn't the case with the previous version. It's well worth to upgrade now.
