 Of course, the producers of this motion picture didn't follow history exactly to the letter, but this was probably not their intention anyway ... they just wanted to make a great movie against the backdrop of some highly interesting history and they accomplished this the best way anyone could. And in fact, the rough framework of history is still covered in this flick as it shows how Christians were burned at the stake, which did happen, and it shows the tremendous obstacles Queen Elizabeth I had to face to obtain the throne of England. And it was this Queen who led England during her reign from near bankruptcy to extraordinary prosperity. The movie is a great movie and it's actually an intriguing thriller. The costumes are just perfect and Cate Blanchett delivers an excellent performance. This motion picture doesn't have the usual glamour of similar movies set in this era, but instead the set was kept pretty authentic and that makes this movie even more interesting and enjoyable.
