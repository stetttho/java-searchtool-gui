 Having grown up in the southern part of Austria in an environment in which Yiddish words were frequently integrated into our everyday German, through this dictionary I was finally able to learn and figure out what all these  words actually meant. There's also a small pronunciation guide included,  but it can help tremendously if you know at least some German to better  understand Yiddish. For my part, I didn't have a problem at all with  pronunciation of the Yiddish words. You'll also find 1001 Yiddish proverbs  with English translations in this dictionary, and it's fun to go through  these mostly one liners. I find this dictionary extensive enough to  research and learn at least some basic Yiddish as it also features short  sentences. It's a lot of fun to read through it, but it's also very  interesting, and everybody interested in languages as well as every fiction  and nonfiction writer should have this dictionary, ... it's the best  resource on this subject that I've found so far.
