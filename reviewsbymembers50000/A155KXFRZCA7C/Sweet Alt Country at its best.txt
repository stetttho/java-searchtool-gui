 "Essence" is a little slow filled with sweet Alt-Country ballads, pure and essential. This CD highlights Lucinda's edgy voice and of course her superb songwriting. From the first song "Lonely Girls" to "Envy the Wind" and onward through various songs, the mood stays pretty much the same and once you arrive at "Bus to Baton Rouge" -- a song I once listened to some 20 times in a row -- you realize that you've just listened to some of the best Alt-Country creations out there. Anyway, it makes sense to listen to the album several times as I have listened to it at least 50-60 times by now and you always discover something new: a slide/steel or dobro guitar here and there and just another touch of emotion in that part. It's an excellent CD!
