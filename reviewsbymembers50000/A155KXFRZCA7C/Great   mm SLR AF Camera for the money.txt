 I've researched SLR cameras for the last few months and I always came back to the Maxxum models by Konica Minolta. Sure, price was a big factor, but also the reviews across the web from other owners and especially regarding the popular and very successful Maxxum 50 finally led me to a purchase of the Maxxum 70. Although this camera seems very sophisticated and it lets you do a lot of the creative settings manually, it's easy in P (green P in a box) which are the auto functions you can and the focusing is just perfect. It's also worth spending the approx. $70 more for the Maxxum 70 vs. the Maxxum 50 because of the focusing features and the in-screen/viewfinder display. The user guide is very helpful and explains the operations of the automatic camera functions well, although some photography knowledge will be helpful to understand especially the manual settings. So far I've only shot a roll of film and it came out perfect. The only little thing that bothered me was that in the viewfinder there were a few very tiny spots and that's why I had to exchange it for another Maxxum 70 unit, and that's why I only gave it 4 stars, although if everything would have been perfect from the start, this camera is definitely worth a five-star rating. This Maxxum 70 is a keeper and it seems to be a solid quality camera -- only time will tell if it holds up, but so far so good. The price just can't be beat, especially with all the features that the Maxxum 70 offers. Also the 28-100mm lens is a nice feature for this price range as most other models come with only a 28-80mm lens, and for a camera like this you most certainly want the 28-100mm lens.
