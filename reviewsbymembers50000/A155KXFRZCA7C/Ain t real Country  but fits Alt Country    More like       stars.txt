 This CD is a nice crossover ... meaning it ain't real country, but if you need to categorize it, it fits into Alt-Country along the lines of Lucinda Williams perhaps with a little bluesy/rocky undertone. It took me several listenings to appreciate this CD and that's why I waited quite a long time from the release date to write a review. I really like this CD now -- it demonstrates excellent songwriting skills with nice fundamental arrangements, meaning there aren't many instruments involved and the bluring lead guitar at times in the right places with hot uncomplicated guitar riffs gives this CD album a nice edge and that's a good thing. Allison's voice is just phenomenal and it may take a little getting used to it as it's on the deeper end of the spectrum, but it shows lots of volume and competence. Needless to say that Allison Moorer is pro and as a singer/songwriter she's certainly in the country's elite.
