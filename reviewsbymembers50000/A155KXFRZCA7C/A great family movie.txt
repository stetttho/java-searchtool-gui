 "Jack Frost" is truly a classical family movie for our time. It's the sotry about a Dad (Michael Keaton) who gets killed in a car accident. One year later, his spirit returns in the form of a lovable  snowman. While during his lifetime, he was always busy, and just didn't  make time to be with his son, now as the snowman he makes a final attempt  to let his son know that he really loved him, and that he'll be always with  him in his heart. It's good to see that Hollywood can still produce movies  that touch the heart and that are enjoyable entertainment for the whole  family. Don't forget to keep a box of Kleenex near by.
