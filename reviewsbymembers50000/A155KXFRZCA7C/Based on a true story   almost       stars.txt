 We didn't have any preconceived ideas about this film and therefore went into the theatre neutral ready to be surprised. The styling and ambience (mood) of this movie is very well captured by the director and the crew. The story itself moves forward and I know based on the fact that this film is based on a true story, and the director didn't want to depart too much from the original account, it seems as if at a certain point, the movie kind of dies without any new surprises. The reason provided for the haunting of the particular family is also kind of weird and senseless to some extent, and it seems forced. The acting is good for this type of film. This movie will not make an impact in your life and I told my wife I will most likely forget it within a few hours -- and basically I did. In other words it's okay to watch it and it's not really a disappointment if you need about 90 minutes to kill and don't have anything else to do, but you will live happily without ever seeing this film.
