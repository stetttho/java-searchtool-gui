 I thought the "Fog" was a good remake and as such it is very predictable for at least the first half or first two thirds of the film. The makers of this new version stuck pretty much to the original storyline, and it were today's special effects and a good shot of creativity that made the movie better in the second half. Neither the acting nor the script is anything to get excited about as it sticks to the routine and it's not the best. In the case of Tom Welling you're hoping that at any moment he will have his "Clark Kent" super powers and during the romantic scenes with his girlfriend Elizabeth you're just waiting for Lana from "Smallville" to show up and give him a disappointed look. It's hard to shake that image if you're on TV with Smallville twice a night for at least five days a week. Anyway, the "Fog" is a nice little spooky ghoststory and the photography and the special effects are good and some people will find it scary. There's a lack of humor, but then the original didn't have that either. I think the storyline comes out in this new one much better than in the 1980 version. My wife liked this movie and that's why it's worth maybe 3 1/2 stars -- it sure makes for a relaxed Popcorn-crunching 90 minutes to cozy up to your spouse.
