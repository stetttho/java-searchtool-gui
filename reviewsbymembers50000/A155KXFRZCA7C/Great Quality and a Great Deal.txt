 I had this DVD player for quite some time now and initially I was a bit suspicious because of the low price. But I'm very happy with this Pioneer DVD/CD player -- it functions perfectly and it does virtually everything I need it for. I just bought this DVD player because my $600+ Sony DVD player which was a few years old had something with the sound quality and I wanted to see if an inexpensive DVD player from a popular consumer brand like Pioneer would do the job, and I'm to say it does and it's even a lot better than my Sony which I've given to my kids for their small TVs. As we watch DVDs several times a week and a lot on the weekends, this DVD player has proven to be a workhorse. If it would break I would definitely buy the same one right away.
