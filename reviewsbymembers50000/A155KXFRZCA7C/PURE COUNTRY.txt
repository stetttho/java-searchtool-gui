 This 2-CD set offers us Country Music fans a rich collection of not only George Strait's 2+ decade long career, but also a wide range of positive country ballads and tear jerkers. Needless to say that George Strait is Pure Country and I'm glad that he remained true to this formula. It's music form the heart, plucking away at the soul and the art of storytelling which made Country music so interesting in the first place. For the price, this is a great collection of 50 number one hits by one of the most consistent and kindest country music artists around. It doesn't get any better than this.
