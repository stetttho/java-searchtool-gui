 I remember buying this album first in the late 70s on vinyl (it was 2 LPs I think) and I listened to it many times. Now it's one convenient CD and the album offers 20 songs ... 5 songs in each of the four categories: Songs of the South, Love Songs, Roots & Prospects, Old Timey Songs. This is my favorite Joan Baez album and I do like the folksy/country blend with the many excellent traditionals. There are no fancy arrangements, just simple and pure Americana music. If you like this album, you may also want to check out Lucinda Williams' "Ramblin' " album which is somewhat along the same lines, but a little bit more bluesy than this CD. I think most music fans will appreciate this Joan Baez Country Music CD album with so many great songs on it -- it's not easy to find these kind of songs on one CD.
