 Oliver Stone researched this movie pretty good to portray Wall Street behind the scenes as authentic as possible. And while the financial dimensions from when this movie was made have significantly increased to at least ten times higher amounts today, the basic principles still apply. That's why the movie comes across fresh. Michael Douglas gives an excellent performance and Charlie Sheen is doing good too. Douglas plays the wealthy financier Gordon Gekko as he takes on one deal after the other with information being the most important commodity . . . insider information that is. The movie isn't made on a small budget either like some of the recent copycats, but instead the beach house, the offices, the plane, the cars (except for Charlie Sheen's car), the wardrobe, all have style. While Gekko is supposed to be the bad guy, he comes across as very likeable and he shows us capitalism at its finest . . . it's a game as money is never lost but only transferred and whoever has the most in the end, wins. The question in the movie of how much is enough is answered there with it's not a matter of enough, and it certainly inspired the bull market of the 90s with its crystal clear reality of no limits and it's never going to be enough. Greed is good as Gekko proclaims in this motion picture.
