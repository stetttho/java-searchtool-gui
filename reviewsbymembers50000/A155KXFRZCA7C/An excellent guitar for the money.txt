 I've owned and played hundreds of guitars and I'm very particular when it comes to sound, workmanship, etc. Because of the low price a not so well-known brand, etc. I was hesitant at first, but once I got this gem I was positively surprised. The neck is fast, the natural has a shiny quality finish top, the resonance and sustain are really great and this guitar also comes with Martin strings. The overall workmanship is really nice and the controls for the preamp are easy to use and they are on top where they are supposed to be. I've been playing guitar for over 30 years and I can easily compare this in China made Rogue to a $1,500 brandname guitar, and this Rogue costs a tiny fraction of that. I don't think you can go wrong with this guitar -- you'll be positively surprised just as I was. Although it's a solid dreadnought, the weight is on the light side which I personally prefer. It's simply fun to pick up this guitar and play it. By the way, some of my friends who are professional musicians bought this Rogue as an additional practice guitar, and all of them really enjoy playing it and they're very satisfied. I think it's also the most inexpensive quality Acoustic/Electric out there.
