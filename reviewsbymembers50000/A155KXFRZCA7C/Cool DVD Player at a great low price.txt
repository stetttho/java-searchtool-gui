 Well, I'm glad that DVD Players are finally coming down in price. And this Oritron DVD Player is a great example for a very good machine at a really low price. Comparing my Sony and this Oritron, there is only little difference in the picture and sound quality. Sure, the higher priced models look more expensive and sturdier while the design and craftsmanship of this Oritron looks a little cheap: plastic and stuff. But, hey, it's a box that fulfills the purpose of playing DVDs at a very affordable price delivering surprisingly good picture and sound quality. Of course, for your home movie theatre you may opt for a higher priced model with some more features and the professional design feel and look. But if you're looking for a DVD player to enjoy DVDs on any TV anywhere, or as an additional DVD player in the various rooms of your house incl. the kids room, the gym, even the bedroom, etc., the Oritron definitely appears to be the best choice of the lower priced models.
