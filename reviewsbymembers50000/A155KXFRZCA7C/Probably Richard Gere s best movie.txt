 It has been a long time since American Gigolo, but Richard Gere remains quite a ladies man. Yes, this movie is about complicated relationsships, but the concept has been exceptionally well executed. The scenery of the Pacific Northwest is just gorgeous with dramatic moods and camera perspectives. I thought that while Richard Gere was phenomenal in Primal Fear, Red Corner and in The Jackal, this movie, Intersection, makes him shine and brings out a lot of his superb acting qualities with all kinds of emotions. It is probably because this movie doesn't have the typical blueprint Hollywood ending, that this flick has been overlooked and so far has never received any significant recognition, but the ending is definitely a surprise. There are a number of interesting twists throughout the film and like I said before, the director really captured the various moods and even created and expressed the right kind of emotions. And although the movie has an overall sad undertone to it as it shows the midlife crisis of architect Eastman (R. Gere), it's just one of these rare motion picture masterpieces which you will want to watch at least a few times every year. It's an excellent picture.
