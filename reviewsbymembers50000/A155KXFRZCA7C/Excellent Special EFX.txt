 The whole movie is like a wild roller-coaster ride from one action scene to the next. The special effects were excellent -- a lot of morphing though and showing of vampire teeth. This is not a film to ask questions, but instead just sit there enjoy the screaming from the characters (and there's a lot of it -- I had to turn my theatre system down as the screaming apparently never stopped), and have some fun for a little more than 2 hours. And you'll see everybody: Dracula and his vampire brides, the Frankenstein monster, wolfman, etc. -- and as mentioned before, a lot of morphing. My teenagers love the movie. You must also forget the original stories of Frankenstein and Dracula, etc. -- although these characters are in the movie -- this film is not about the underlying work of literature, but it's just what it is: a wild roller-coaster ride with lots of action and special effects, just for the fun of it to pass a rainy afternoon.
