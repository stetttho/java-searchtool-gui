 I always wanted an Ovation as many of my friends got their Ovation over the years. Finally, a few years ago, I bought my first Ovation which was the Elite and it was just a beautiful guitar -- I like the popular Ovation soundholes. The guitar plays like an electric guitar and the action was low which I like. It also seemed sturdy at first until the spruce top cracked a little bit within less than two years -- that's one thing that bothered me a lot. The integrated guitar tuner is a nice feature as is the preamp. The Elite will play without amplification almost like a regular acoustic guitar, or if plugged in it becomes even more versatile. The guitar is pretty light weighted. If you sit down an play it the rounded back will won't let you hold the guitar too long ... the guitar will slip a bit. And a note regarding the comfort issue are the connecting edges from the top to the back which are rather harsh/sharp and not rounded, and may leave some marks in your right hand as you clutch the guitar and rest your arm on the top -- so you need to wear long sleeve shirts to prevent that. Overall it's a great guitar with excellent sound capabilities (it doesn't have the ring like regular acoustics) and it looks really good, plays fast and easy, and based on our experience the top seems a little fragile.
