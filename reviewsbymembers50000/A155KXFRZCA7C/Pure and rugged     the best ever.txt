 I would not have expected this type of an album from Bruce Springsteen. The whole CD has excellent arrangements and Bruce lets it all out with a touch of Dylan, but still his own, of course. It doesn't matter if someone is a Springsteen fan or not, or a Seeger fan for that matter or not, this type of music is rarely made in our days anymore -- it's a superb top-notch production with acoustic instruments with a rather large band. It's folksy and a shot of blues, zydeco, cajun (because of the harmonica) especially on "Pay Me My Money Down" which really rocks. There are haunting songs like "Shenandoah" on it, but overall it's a fun CD with nice little stories and this CD should be in every CD collection, and it's worth every Penny.
