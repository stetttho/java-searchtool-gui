 Although the message of the film is unrealistic as it is based on the fictitious global warming hype which is a weird theory by a number of scientists and greenpeace fanatics to get government grants and so forth, the special effects in this flick are very well done. The plot is the age-old, but usually always interesting father saves son story. And the dad (Dennis Quaid) who is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, does a great job in making this film more interesting despite a soso script. But the humanistic message in this movie is good and encouraging. This flick makes for a nice popcorn crunching evening at the fireplace with warm blankets all around. And once you see this movie you probably won't look forward to the winter anymore. But as mentioned before, the special effects are great as these show us unrealistic scenarios in this well-done disaster flick and it's fun to stimulate our imagination once in a while.
