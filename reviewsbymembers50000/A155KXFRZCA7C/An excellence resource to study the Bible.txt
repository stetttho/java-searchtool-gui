 We've used this book since 1982 for individual studies and Bible study groups. It's an excellent resource for studying the Bible. It's just as valuable for new Christians as it is helpful for mature believers. The book  contains 52 vital doctrines of the Bible, the cardinal doctrines that are  essential for the understanding of Christianity and a Christian's growth.  It features chapters on the "Bible," "God the Son,"  "God the Trinity," "God the Holy Spirit,"  "Satan," "Man," "The Church," "The  Second Coming of Christ," and so much more. At the end of each chapter  it has a short test which will be very helpful in Bible study groups as  well as for individual studies. Everything is explained in an  easy-to-understand format and it also discusses various viewpoints of a  certain doctrine. This book is also helpful as a quick reference guide. We  highly recommend this book!
