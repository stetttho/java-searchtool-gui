 I must admit that I was never really interested in Madonna's music, although I respected her for her marketability. But "Frozen" on her last CD did the job and I really liked it. Now MUSIC is truly an excellent CD and that's what I call artistic freedom. MUSIC shows us an artistically free Madonna, going over the top, making music for the fun of it and it works. The title song as simple as the instrumentation and the lyrics are, is captivating...wants you to put on your dancing shoes and party all night long. Usually on a CD you only find one or two songs that are good, but on MUSIC I liked 9 songs out of 10 and that means a lot. "Nobody's Perfect" and "I Deserve It" are great songs too. Don't be fooled by the cover, it ain't a Country album and it's not really Pop either, instead it's hip artsy techno with some rock elements mixed in--it sounds really good. This CD is a must-have in every CD collection. There you go, girl--nice job!
