 While The Apostle certainly doesn't give a true picture of today's Christianity, it is perhaps an accurate portrayal of a Pentecostal preacher. The story line is great and has all the aspects of human emotion. A preacher (Robert Duvall) finds out that his wife (Farrah Fawcett) betrays him and when he snaps, in the heat of the moment, he kills her lover. A sad mistake, and as the preacher tries to figure out what to do next, he leaves town and hides out in a sleepy Louisiana village. There he starts a new church and as a man of God he goes through the struggle of being on the run from the law. Needless to say that it's an excellent performance by Robert Duvall. This movie is even more remarkable as Duvall wrote the script, he himself got the financing together, and he is also the director of this movie. The Apostle is a testimony of Duvall the great artist. Some of the characters are played by non-actors, but these folks do an excellent job, and it gives the movie an additional sense of authenticity. The soundtrack is also a great compilation of gospel music that is very fit for this motion picture.
