 Depending where you at when you watch this flick, but if you're on your ski vacation, then watching this film you'll forget that your snowboard is outside and that it's cold, because the film concerns a family vacation at a lake around labor day. Steve Martin is funny as always and there are a few new lines and ideas. And sure there are a couple of stupid scenes that should have been left out, but not too bad so that your 8-year old can probably still watch it without asking too many questions. Eugene Levy (probably not as well known by his name to too many folks) is excellent and I like him goofing off even more than Martin for the most part. The storyline is about two extended families that apparently had a type of rivalry going on for many years, and now they meet at that particular lake again and on labor day they have a family competition there and so on. While Martin plays the loving Baker dad who's not too well off financially, Levy plays the now wealthy Murtaugh dad who's on his third marriage (with Carmen Elektra as number 3) and who owns most of the land around the lake. The only problem I can see is that much of the fun is predictable, but there are still a number of hearty laughs. It's a relaxing family movie and you just wish that it was summer out there and you too could go for a swim and/or so some water skiing in a lake instead of the apres ski. Well, this movie is an opportunity to take your popcorn and relax during this busy holiday season, and to have some clean fun for the most part.
