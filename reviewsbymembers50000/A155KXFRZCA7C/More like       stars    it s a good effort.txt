 It was the recent music video that caught my attention to Kathleen's music once again. Although I'm interested in all new singer/songwriters, her first album, Failer, was not convincing enough for me to purchase it. With "Back to Me" the quality has increased and the edge to her music is increasing. Comparing her to Lucinda Williams is not justified as there's maybe one or two instances on the whole album that may remind us of Lucinda for a second -- Kathleen Edwards is too perfect to be compared to Lucinda Williams as I doubt it that Kathleen's band records the first take for the album like Lucinda's band does. I would compare Kathleen's style more to DAR Williams which is probably the closest comparison if comparsions need to be made. I had Kathleen's CD in my car for one spin and then again at home to listen to it a few more times -- and it does take a few times listening to it to discover her real craft, but "Back to Me" is not yet convincing enough and I restled with 3 stars or 4 stars as I think that 3 1/2 stars would be justified. Hopefully the next album will be at least 4 stars. The songs on the album vary ... some ballads, but most songs are a little bit on the wild side with some edge to it and that's good. Kathleen's voice is a little bit annoying at times as it is still a little bit too bright because of her age, but it will mature with time and then comparisons to Lucinda W. will be more realistic.
