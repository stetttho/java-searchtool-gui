 Recorded in the late 70s, this is an excellent Blues-based album with a shot of traditionals. Lucinda does a phenomenal job with her acoustic guitar and a dobro at times, it's simple and pure -- no fancy arrangements. It's like the girl with a guitar joined at times by some fellow musicians in the living room and/or on the porch of a cozy home somewhere in the deep South -- even sounds like a nice evening around the camp fire. Great Americana! Her voice had already the edge on this CD which Lucinda fans have gotten to appreciate and treasure over the many years she has been around in the music scene. On this CD she also does "Little Darling Pal of Mine" as well as an excellent version of "Jamabalaya" and of all things the sweet "Great Speckled Bird" and "You're Gonna Need that Pure Religion." I think every music fan in general will appreciate this really honest CD -- it's not easy to find good music like this anymore.
