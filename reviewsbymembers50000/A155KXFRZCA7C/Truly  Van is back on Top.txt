 Van Morrison packs interesting ballads into this CD. The sound patterns are simple, underlined at times by a Hammond organ. We've listened to this CD well over a hundred times, and it continues to be a pleasure to hear  songs like "When the Leaves come falling down" and  "Philosophers Stone." Out of the 10 songs, we pretty much like 8  of them, and that alone justifies five stars. Folks not familiar with Van  Morrison, may have to listen through the album a few times to fine-tune  their ears. But once you're into it, the lyrics tell stories about life and  at times they really work on your soul. The music is uncomplicated and the  rhythm is easy going in typical blues mode. We think you'll enjoy this CD.
