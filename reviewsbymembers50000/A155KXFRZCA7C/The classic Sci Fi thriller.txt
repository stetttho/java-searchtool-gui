 I liked that movie ever since its release in the early 80s. I've seen it many times. Before the Director's Cut, there was the original theatrical version which had the voiceover narration of the main character, Rick Deckard (Harrsion Ford), which I personally liked a lot better. It's a dark movie about replicants with human appearance, but a short life span, who are eager to find a way to extend their existence. Rutger Hauer plays one of these robots and its one of his best roles ever. Needless to say, Harrison Ford plays superbly. Blade Runner really reinvented the Sci-Fi thriller genre and brought it back to life. While this movie was already made some two decades ago, it's as fresh as it can be and a lot of contemporary Sci-Fi flicks continue to borrow from this motion picture. The scenery, a futuristic L.A., the concept of humanoids or replicants, flying automobiles, and so forth. The soundtrack is also unique. Sean Young looks pretty good and stylish in this movie, too. And we consider Blade runner to be the ultimate Sci-Fi thriller, which has no match so far.
