 This book is probably one of the best grammar books out there, and it is absolutely a "Must-Read" for every writer (fiction and nonfiction, also journalists should read through it). The author is clear  and precise in her explanations of grammatical concepts and possibilities,  and she makes grammar fun. Some conventional approaches to grammar are  challenged in this book, but the author Constance Hale--who currently  teaches at U.C. Berkeley--is a qualified professional in her field. She's a  maverick and she offers a healthy dose of motivation to be creative with  your use of grammar in the new millenium. This book can really help to  equip a writer with this certain edge in his or her writing projects.
