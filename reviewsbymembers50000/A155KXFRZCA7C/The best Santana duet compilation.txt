 From the 3 duet compilations produced so far, "Shaman" is truly the best. Of course, it depends on taste and that is subjective, but there's lots of talent on this CD. And as always you hear Santana's guitar cry. You'll find Macy Gray with "Amore" and Michelle Branch with "The Game of Love" as well as "Novus" featuring Placido Domingo, and the excellent Dido with "Feels Like Fire." Well, I have all three compilations and I've listened to them all many, many times, but while no CD can be absolutely perfect like anything else in life, I find that "Shaman" has a lot of quality tunes on it.
