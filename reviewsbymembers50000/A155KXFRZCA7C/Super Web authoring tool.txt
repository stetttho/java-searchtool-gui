 Years ago we started out with studying complicated Html andwriting alll this strange code, going through all the tedious,confusing process. But we didn't want to be geeks, we just wanted to create excellent professional-looking Websites with not too much of a hassle in a short period of time. And thanks to Bill Gates for making Microsoft FrontPage 2000 available, it's certainly the easiest Web-authoring tool out there and the results can look just as professional as with any of the other complicated software tools, but with FP2000 you can do the job in a fraction of time. With FrontPage you'll save so much time: once you know it, it's basically like click and paste and it's so much fun to create new Websites and Web pages. Although you don't necessarily need it, but if you combine FrontPage with MS PhotoDraw and other MS applications, your Website will fly with excellent special features and graphics like a rocket. . . . We have only good things to say about it, and of course FrontPage 2000 is a tremendous improvement from the previous version. To really get into the heart of FrontPage 2000 you will need a few easy books to show you some tricks which you won't find in the original MS manuals, e.g. FrontPage 2000 Fast & Easy by Coletta Witherspoon is very helpful, and it will give you a headstart. But using FrontPage 2000 is a walk in the park compared to any other professional Web-creation software. We highly recommend it!
