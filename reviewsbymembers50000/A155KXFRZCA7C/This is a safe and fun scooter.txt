 The brake lever on the handlebars is truly an excellent feature. This scooter has two brakes which so far is rare to find on any other scooter. And why older kids, namely teenagers may not need the handlebar brake lever feature, it is ideal for smaller kids until they learn to use the foot brake in the back. This scooter is a lot of fun and it appears to be solidly made, incl. the board which is wide and long enough and of durable quality. This scooter is not heavy either considering that most parts are apparently made out of steel, which makes it sturdier. Sure, teenagers may opt for the trendier Razor scooter, but kids starting out, like my 6-year old, and for kids 6-9 years of age and older ones who want extra safety, this is definitely the scooter to own at an affordable price. They'll love it.
