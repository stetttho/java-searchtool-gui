 The story is just phenomenal. Against all odds, an aged Burt Munro makes it from his little shack in New Zealand through many hurdles to speed week at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah near Wendover. Munro has basically no money, and he has been dreaming for over 25 years of showing off his fast 40+ year Indian motorcycle he modified and tinkered on which supposedly would do 200 mph.  The film plays in 1967 and it's based on a true story and a story it is. It's inspiring and the cast with Anthony Hopkins as Burt Munro and all the the other supporting actors is excellent -- it's so real -- it's like an exceptional documentary and motion picture at the same time. Sadly, aside from myself only another couple were in the theatre watching this flick. I think anyone who has a dream, either in business, or sports or whatever kind of achievement, needs to see this film -- it's encouraging, because if Munro made it, then everyone else should be able to go for it. Aside from these impressions of this movie, the photography is also very well done and the script is great too. This motion picture deserves a full 5 stars and more if possible. A great inspiring film.
