 If you want to see Jack Nicholson in one of his best performances, showcasing the craft at its best, then you have to see As Good As It Gets. Nicholson plays a grouchy writer with some strange habits ... he's a germ freak. And while the story isn't about anything exceptional, except for "usual" circumstances in life, the characters are highly interesting, especially Nicholson's and Kinnear's characters. It's just a joy to watch great acting in this cute little story, and to relax as you watch this 2+ hour comedy. Helen Hunt is also doing a great job and she fits well into this triangle. You'll enjoy it!
