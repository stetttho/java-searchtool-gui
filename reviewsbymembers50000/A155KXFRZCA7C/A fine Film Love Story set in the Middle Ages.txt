 It's not that this film swept me away and made me teary-eyes like the hero (Tristan) in this movie often did, but it is a well-made movie. I only went to watch it because my wife wanted to see it, and I don't regret it that I went along. Also, it's worth noting that it's a Scott Free production, meaning the Scott brothers (Ridley and Tony) were involved and that alone guarantees for a quality motion picture. The scenery (it was filmed in Ireland and in the Czech Republic), the photography and the costumes are excellent. Rufus Sewell as Lord Marke did an excellent job of portraying the disposition and attitude of Lord Marke. You have to see the film to understand that this type of rather gracious disposition is very difficult to play in a believable manner and it's a rare type of disposition found in characters. Sewell does an excellent job - if it were up to me he would get an Oscar for that without a question. Overall it's a sweet love story set in a very rough environment about Lords and Kings without the glamour in England (Angleland) and Ireland in the middle ages. This movie is like an excellent book with memorable characters and it doesn't matter that most of the actors are not as well known, but their acting is very good. You'll be positively surprised.
