 The acting is very good in this flick and also the photography is exceptional. The atmosphere is communicated well and it's a film that gets by with minimal special effects as most of the thrill is created with crackling doors, surprise images, increased music volume, etc. So it's scary in that sense that a thrill of tension is provided. The story is okay too and it keeps your mind occupied almost until the end. Is this movie really scary that you'll be haunted by it in your dreams? Probably not, although it's a somewhat haunting story. There are twists and turns, but most of them are predictable. The ending is okay, but in no way is it a radical twist that will knock you out of your socks. The story revolves around the Voodoo culture in Louisiana and takes place around a remote Antebellum home in the present time. It's like a ghost story and it's basically a good movie -- a nice surprise for the end of this summer's movie season that must have been one of the worst in motion picture history. I doubt it that this film will make it into my DVD collection, but it's a good flick to cool off after a hot summer day. As mentioned, the photography is very well done with some unique camera angles and there is constant tension which makes it a good thriller.
