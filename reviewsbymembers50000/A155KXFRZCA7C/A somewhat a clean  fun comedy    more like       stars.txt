 I thought this was a funny movie to some degree. At least there isn't any bad language in it and for a change it's fun to see a new Lincoln Navigator get abused. Sure, the plot isn't that special and the whole movie is a little flat to say the least, but I can say that the kids like the movie and have watched it already a few times over the last few days -- so it may become a babysitter standard -- we'll see. I would give this movie more like 3 1/2 stars if even that many, but overall the 4 stars are more a rating from my kids and the neighborhood kids who really liked this flick.
