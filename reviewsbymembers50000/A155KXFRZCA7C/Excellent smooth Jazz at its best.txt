 With "Still Small Voice" Paul Jackson Jr. has delivered one of these classic smooth jazz albums that hopefully will also be played on radio for many, many years to come. Every true smooth jazz connoisseur will fall in love with the music of Paul Jackson Jr. as it reminds us a lot of George Benson and more recently of Norman Brown. He's just a master of his instrument. Apparently he plays a semi-hollow Gibson which has a little bit more edge to it than the commonly used full hollowbody jazz boxes which e.g. George Benson uses ... and actually I like Paul's use of the semi-hollow Gibson as he uses it in a spirited way in the right places, while the overall tone remains smooth. Once again I think that this CD has been overlooked so far and I only found it by "accident" so to speak. It also seems that while Paul has garnered lots of recognition with the pros in the studios over the years, the general public has not yet discovered Paul Jackson Jr. and I sure hope that this CD will accomplish that. In the huge quantity of music being produced these days, it's hard to find a real gem and once you find one, it's like the eagerly sought after reward at the end of an extensive treasure hunt through the jungle. I'll keep this CD in my car in the rotation of my 6-disc player and I'm sure I'll listen to it dozens of times over the next few months -- it's really great music. Truly a job well done!
