 A movie like this with an aircraft carrier, tailhooks, fighter planes, etc. will always lead to "Top Gun" memories. The jet planes are Stealth (duhhhh) and not F-16s. But there are many similarities to the original with a gang of three, starting off with a training exercise, and then the combat situations adopted for our present age. Then mix in some Sci-Fi with A.I., etc. There's not much to show differently with planes in the air, over the water, through mountainous regions, taking off and landing on the carrier, and of course North Korea has to be in play as one of the last rogue nations. The problem is that the movie starts off a little slow, and the script is nothing short of terrible -- the best thing would have been to have not one person say anything at all -- just show the action, the planes, and the great photography mixed in with excellent CGI effects. Not a word shall be said about acting, ... and green apples can be found everywhere, literally. Well, why 4 stars? Because as this flick moves onward it does have some great photography and action scenes and it gets a little better, and everything looks very realistic. It's more like 3 1/2 stars, but my wife liked it a lot more than I did and it wasn't a complete waste of my time or money either. I doubt it that this film will make it into my DVD collection. I hope Hollywood gets at least a few good scripts in the future, because the current material is just not cutting it.
