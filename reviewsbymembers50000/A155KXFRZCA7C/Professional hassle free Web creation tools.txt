 This is an excellent combination for the professional and hobby Web designer. FrontPage 2000 is so easy to use, even my 11-year old can now design professionally looking Websites. And there are so many features within FP and all of them are easy to implement. While with other programs it may take hours and lots of code knowledge, in the case of FrontPage it's click and paste and you can do the work in minutes and it's actually fun. Sure, there are some limitations, but other software can cost a multiple of this Microsoft package and with these other software packages usually you have to learn Html code, etc. and these are not as efficient as FrontPage. Overall, FrontPage offers a lot of possibilities and if you integrate PhotoDraw it expands your creative possibilities even further. At first I didn't like PhotoDraw that much as I was used to Adobe applications, but as I learned to use PhotoDraw I figured out many of the features and it was fairly easy to create exciting graphics. PhotoDraw allows you to create animated Gifs, rollover effects and it has also a number of Web graphics that can be specified to your own liking. While new users may have to get used to PhotoDraw, once the basic steps and features are understood, which is not that difficult to learn, PhotoDraw becomes a fun tool and in the combination with FrontPage your graphics will shine as an excellent application on your Website. People always ask me how we created this feature and that effect, and with other software it would take a long time to write all this code, but with FrontPage and PhotoDraw it can be done in minutes and in a snap. You may also want to buy a few books to learn both programs with its more sophisticated applications more quickly, which can be learned in a weekend.
