 The Pioneer DVR-S806 doesn't look flashy, but rather simple. And the good part is that the operation is also very simple. It's a handy unit that can be placed vertically or horizontally. The connectivity is convenient too as it has the FireWire IEEE 1394 connections and the USB. To begin with it's best to immediately install the supplied Software disk in order to be able to burn DVDs and CDs. Some things that bothered me that during the burning process if the files surpassed the disk capacity the CD-R would not be finalized and such a CD-R was longer be usable -- there should be some sort of indication before the burning process to let the user know of this or that disk can be used. Also on the speed of CD-R media there were a few problems regarding that during the burning process suddenly a message popped up that the burner can't burn at this speed, and then this particular CD-R once again was no longer usable. It probably just takes some fine-tuning on the user's part to use the correct DVD and CD media for burning, etc. The final product is perfect and there are no complaints. CDs (the CD-R media) are immediately playable in any CD player as well as the DVDs (DVD-/+R media) in most DVD players (let's put it this way that I had no problems at all with the DVD players that I used). Although everything works fine and I think this is a top-quality reliable product at a great low price, I don't feel like giving it 5 stars because of the little thing/lack of initial info with regarding CD-Rs, but maybe other burners are the same. The Pioneer DVR-S806 is a great unit and if lost or whatever, I'd buy it in a heartbeat again -- I think it's one of the best units at the best price out there.
