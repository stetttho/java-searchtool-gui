 Needless to say that this movies is made for a very young audience -- for approx. the 6-year olds or so. There's lots of fantasy in it and it's obvious that the creative team has put a lot of effort and hard work into the making of this 75-minute flick -- that's why we find it tough as we're sure they've done their very best. But before someone spends their hard-earned dollar on this, it's worth it to look at it objectively. For our part we think that the background graphics/animation is not of the best quality and even vague at times, although there are scenes that are nicely done; then the script doesn't stand out at all as much of the storyline is cliche regarding this type of genre. At times some of the characters remind us of a cheap imitation of the first star wars movie, and it seems as if the execution of the whole concept is just missing something. We're just glad that the violence is toned down and that this flick has a PG rating. We're certain that the creators had apparently the best of intentions, but when it comes right down to it I wouldn't waste my money or time on this film and I wouldn't let my kids watch this movie -- there are better films out there. Some kids may be motivated to get involved in weird video games after watching this movie and it may also lead them to watch other films in this genre which may not be healthy for their little minds.
