 When someone puts all his or her heart into a work, the outcome is always something special. But when you also have talent like Jewel in this case, the result can be breathtaking. Songs like "Foolish Games," "Who Will Save Your Soul" and most other songs on this CD just touch your heart as they come from the heart. Especially at her age at that time, these songs speak volumes of what moves her emotionally as these songs will also move every listener. The craft of songwriting is very well demonstrated on this excellent album and the sound is fresh and unique to say the least.
