 Usually, the Donald shoots always some good comments around, and in this book his wit is not lacking. Clearly, this book is targeted for success in the Real Estate market and that's what Donald Trump apparently knows the best. The subtitle is a little misleading, because not "Everything you need to know about success, real estate, and life" is in this book, instead there are some gems here and there and you won't find anything really profound. Needless to say that the Donald is an icon, a legend of the American Dream and all success-hungry people can look to him as a shining example of that. The only sad thing was that he publicly attacked Mark Cuban which was a major mistake, because aside from Real Estate the Donald isn't doing so well with some of his other big-money businesses and much could be said about his failures in that area. For instance, how can anybody lose even a dime with a Casino when it's a 24-hour piggy bank? ... well, the Donald showed us how a potentially great Casino company can lose it all. So after all, the "billionaire" isn't that hot in every area, but granted he surely knows Real Estate I guess, and now he's the TV-star -- that's a nice little touch for a guy who is now in his late 50s. Like we said, you won't read anything in this book that changes the world, but for personal gain we all can learn from Trump's extensive business/real estate experience and buying this book is an inexpensive way of learning some interesting strategies.
