 This is truly a haunting thriller. Excellent photography and superb acting, especially by Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. This is a smart thriller dealing with practices of some pharmaceutical companies regarding the testing of new drugs on the African people. This film brings a real behind-the-scenes Africa with just stunning pictures. Overall, besides tackling and investigating the topic of the pharma industry, this is a beautiful, although sad, love story. It's about a man's presumption due to walking by "sight" and losing trust because of certain strange circumstances suspecting the worst, only to find out later when he sees the whole picture that his presumptions were wrong. Then the guilt, the regret ... but it's too late. I don't think that this movie will necessarily attract the broad movie-going audience, although I think as many people as possible should see this excellent motion picture. You will need to use your brain in order to follow the storyline and don't expect an action movie, but it's a real thriller based on the book by one of the world's top thriller novelists, John LeCarre'. After seeing this movie you will appreciate your daily blessings of living in the civilzed Western world.
