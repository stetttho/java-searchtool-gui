 While I fell asleep in Deep Impact who had the same topic about a meteor hitting the earth, Armageddon was an action-packed adventure. This movie is a Jerry Bruckheimer production which almost comes with a written guarantee that it's a well-funded motion picture. Aside from the topic that a meteor is on its way to collide with planet earth, the plot was well thought through as a gang of tough guys (oil drillers, etc.) are hired by the U.S. government to destroy the meteor before the predicted collision with earth. The cinematography and the effects are excellent and it's a blow-away movie supported by a powerful soundtrack. As Aerosmith sings that you don't want to miss a thing, you sure don't want to miss this picture.
