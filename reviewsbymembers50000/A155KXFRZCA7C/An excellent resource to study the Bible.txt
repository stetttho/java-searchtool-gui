 We've used this book since 1982 for individual studies and Bible study groups. It's an excellent resource for studying the Bible. It's just as valuable for new Christians as it is helpful for mature believers. The book  contains 52 vital doctrines of the Bible, the cardinal doctrines that are  essential for the understanding of Christianity and for a Christian's  growth. It features chapters on "The Bible," "God the  Son," "God the Trinity," "God the Holy Spirit,"  "Satan," "Man," "The Church," "The  Second Coming of Christ," and so much more. Each chapter concludes  with a short test which will be very helpful in Bible study groups.  Everything is explained in an easy-to-understand format. This book is very  helpful and we highly recommend it.
