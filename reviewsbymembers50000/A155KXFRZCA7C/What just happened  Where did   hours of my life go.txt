 The only reason I give this movie 3 stars is for the great acting performance by Dakota Fanning -- she's really talented and she's doing an excellent job. Otherwise this film wouldn't even deserve 2 stars. Tom Cruise apparently only gets the money because he's the box office draw, but with a "performance" like in this film, he better get on track for the next project or he won't be a box office draw no more. And without Cruise's and Spielberg's name attached to this flick, it would be hard to believe that many people would go and see this motion picture. After losing about 2 hours of my life watching this film and having great expectations for it, it was a major disappointment. Aside from Dakota, the acting is weak to say the least. And I'm sick and tired of moviemakers trying to carry a film only by its display of CGI effects without a storyline or a shallow storyline at best. Yes, the CGI effects are cool, but I don't need to see this flick to know what amazing things computers and software can do in our day and age. I don't know what happened, but lots of people I talked to after this film ended, just shaked their heads and just wanted their two hours of their lives back.
