 The subject matter is quite interesting as it gives a little bit of an inside view into one of America's favorite sports, namely sport betting on football games. Pacino is the aging rainmaker and McConaughey plays the rookie who has like any other decent person a problem saying the F word. Therefore Pacino gives him the F word education. The acting is actually pretty good. The storyline is okay, but this ain't another Wall Street movie or anything like that. McConaughey's character is introduced into the world of sports betting as he has a knack for calling the games and being right by over 80% until a hot streak turns into a cold streak. The technology is a little bit backwards as in our day and age the 900 numbers are a relic from the last century. Today the Internet has taken over with nice practical features incl. palm and blackberry applications, etc. The moral of the story though is that no matter how much "skill" you have, when it comes to gambling a toss of the coin is just as good and sometimes better than any "educated" guess no matter how much of an "expert" you are. Is this movie worth spending your hard-earned dollars and using up two hours of your precious life? Well, let's put it this way: I was the only person in the 300+ seat theatre and I envy the other people who spent quality time somewhere else. Due to the frequent use of the F word I would say no, and there's no reason why this word is used so frequently, because in the real world most decent people won't even use it -- it's way below their class.
