 The cool thing on this CD is that Jimmy Buffett sings duets with lots of well-known folks. There are some excellent tunes on this album. Quite frankly, this is my favorite Jimmy Buffett CD. It's relaxing and a whole lotta fun -- it's like a party. I'm only giving this CD four stars, because it just doesn't knock me off my feet which would be necessary for a 5-star rating. Let's put it this way: I had the CD in my car for a week or so, but now it's back on the collection rack. Obviously, in "License to Chill" Buffett is trying to go Country as he features George Strait, Alan Jackson, Kenny Chesney, Nanci Griffith, etc. on the various songs. I thought that "It's 5 o'Clock somewhere" would be on this CD, which would have made sense, but it isn't as that particular song is on the Alan Jackson Greatest Hits Vol. II double CD set. But here we get to know an even more relaxed Jimmy Buffett and he feels very comfortable with his Country Music friends.
