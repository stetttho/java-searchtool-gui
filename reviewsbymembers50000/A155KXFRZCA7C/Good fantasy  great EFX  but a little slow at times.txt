 Needless to say that this latest and probably last installment of Star Wars has come a long way technically since the original was released decades ago. The effects are excellent and the scenery, etc., and even some points in the storyline are very good about envy, mistreatment, presumption, deception, etc. and how Skywalker became Darth Vader, etc. and the whole plot, and how applicable these things are for our lives too. My only complaint is that there are a number of slow passages that seem to go on and on forever. On the other hand there are great battle scenes. I would have a tendency to give it only 3 stars, but because of the really lively fantasy expressed by Lucas I need to give it 4 stars. Or maybe I've just outgrown the whole Star Wars thing, although I was excited to see this movie, but I felt a little disappointed and I fell almost asleep twice.
