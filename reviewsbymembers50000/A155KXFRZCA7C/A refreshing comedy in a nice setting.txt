 After watching this movie several times on TV, I just had to buy the DVD. This is a funny flick. It's about two guys who are scoundrels as they offer romance to various ladies in order to get their hands into the pockets of these wealthy ladies. There's a difference though, the one (Michael Caine) does it with style and the other (Steve Martin) is a struggling wannabe. Then it comes down to a bet between the two of whoever first obtains the favor of one particular lady. And it's a laugh fest as both come up with one surprise after the other, and it's hillarious. Both, Caine and Martin show forth their excellent acting skills. The setting is the Cote d'Azure and that's a nice additional touch. The ending is a surprise, too. You'll love this movie!
