 Not only does this movie show quite a bit about our town, Las Vegas, but it's hilarious. We especially liked Randy Quaid and he just doesn't stop--every time he comes on the scene, it's a laughfest indeed. The story  line is obvious: the Griswold family travels to fabulous Las Vegas. And  while Clark (Chevy Chase) loses all his money, teenage Griswold Junior,  equipped with a fake ID, takes Las Vegas by storm, winning cash and cars  everywhere. Ellen Griswold (Beverly D'Angelo) becomes a  "Wayniac"--the nickname for Wayne Newton fans. Even the Hoover  Dam tour and the Siegfried & Roy show turn into a wild adventure full  of laughs. One thing is certain: you're going to crack up, and it's sure  going to wet your appetite to visit fabulous Las Vegas in the near future.
