 Needless to say that Norah's first CD was excellent, but her new one "Feels Like Home" does feel like home. It's a little bit more edgy--a dobro/slide guitar here and there, a nice electric piano and an organ at times, and even an harmonica, and a sax lightly accent this album. Norah's vocal range is top, going from pure jazz to a little touch of alt-country and then even moving into a little blues here. I'm telling you if you want to listen to excellent music that has this special touch pulling on your soul then this is it. And it's not heavy, instead it's easy, real smoooth with a little edge here and there. You'll be surprised! Excellent, Norah!
