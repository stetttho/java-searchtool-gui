 While some aspects of the reality portrayed in this film based on a true story may only apply to a certain group of people, namely to the folks who work in the steel mines up north, the other harsh reality of sexual harrasment in the workplace will certainly apply to a lot of women thinking back expecially to the 70s and 80s when anything was 'acceptable'. It's interesting to note that it was not too long ago, actually only in the last decade of the previous century that women obtained legal protection in this area. It's so weird to think back to the constant harrasment women had to endure before these laws were established. Well, the movie is certainly excellent ... a tear jerker at times, but it's a great story ... and it's certainly not the cozy popcorn-crunching flick for a Saturday afternoon, although I watched it on a Saturday afternoon at the theatre. The acting is superb and aside from Charlize Theron who always delivers the best performances, Woody Harrelson is very likeable in this role, and Richard Jenkins also did an excellent job. The photography is breathtaking and the soundtrack is pretty cool and appropriate for the atmosphere with several Bob Dylan tunes. Surprisingly there isn't much courtroom drama as the focus seems to be more on relationships and also on the portrayal of blue-collar America as well as on the topical content. It's a harsh reality and it ain't pretty at times, and if you're driving your BMW and are living in a warmer climate state with nice homes, clean yards, and good restaurants, etc. then you'll appreciate your lifestyle a lot more after watching this movie. On the rating it's almost a PG13 if there weren't certain words at times and certain brief images of things that belong into the world of adults. This is one of the best motion pictures of the year.
