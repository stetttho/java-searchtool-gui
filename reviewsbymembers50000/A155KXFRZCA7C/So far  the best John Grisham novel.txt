 This is certainly the best John Grisham novel so far. A self-made billionaire commits suicide. When his last will is discovered, it is mind-boggling to the supposed-to-be heirs. He leaves his vast fortune to  one of his children, Rachel. But she's enstranged to her father, and has  given her life to God as a missionary in the jungles of Brazil. Now, the  lawyers have to find her, which is not an easy task. In the meanwhile, the  supposed-to-be heirs are circling like vultures, trying to overturn the  'insane' will. The story is suspenseful, heart-warming, adventurous, and  beautifully written. It's also a picture of human nature, and the story  carries a rare genuine redemptive byline. Really a good book!
