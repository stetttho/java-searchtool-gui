 This movie was well worth the 3 hours which passed by quickly. I usually wouldn't even bother to view flicks like that, but based on the reviews and previews/trailer this film looked interesting and it fully delivered on the promise. The CGI effects are well applied and it's just phantastic how they produced such an authentic motion picture. There are dinosaurs in there on Skull Island, monster spiders, giant cockroaches, and every other creature you can imagine from a pre-historic world or from a nightmare. Jack Black also delivers as an actor and does an excellent job. The moods are captured well and all the details seem to have been a lot of work and you can tell that craftsmen were at work here. This is a classic motion picture so to speak, or it will become one, and it's a cinematic experience so rare these days. Take the popcorn out and the nachos with cheese and you've got to see it on the big screen and also the DVD, whenever it will be released, will become part of the collection.
