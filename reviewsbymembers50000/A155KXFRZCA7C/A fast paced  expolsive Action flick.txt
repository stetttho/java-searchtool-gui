 It sure was John Travolta's breakthrough role in 1996. From softy to tough guy, but the role of the renegade Stealth bomber pilot fits him well. The story line is about stolen nukes and the plot centers around a high-profile extortion scheme. The action in this movie never stops and continues to the end. Christian Slater is playing well, too, as John Woo directed Broken Arrow. This movie spun a series of imitators since its release, but if you want to see the real thing, then this is it. There are great effects, cool stunts and lots of breathtaking chase scenes. The only thing we didn't like was the occasional foul language and it could have been left out and would have made the movie even better.
