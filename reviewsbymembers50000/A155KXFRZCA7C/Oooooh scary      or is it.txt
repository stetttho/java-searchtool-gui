 True, the concept sounds really cool, but the execution is lacking quite a bit. There are a lot of rough edges as characters appear in places within seconds after being somewhere else just a minute ago -- it seems like a lot of stuff was left on the cutting floor. When it comes to scary: my heart rate didn't go up at any point in the movie -- as an example I found "The Ring" far more scarier and better excuted than this flick. I wouldn't even call it a teenage slasher movie, instead while the movie has an interesting premise, there isn't any surprising twist and it fails in the detail of building suspense -- most things and events are predictable. One issue that really bothered me was that I didn't feel anything for any character and I could have cared less who dies next, and this means that the storyline and character development was pretty weak. Why 3 stars? Because there are worse movies out there, and this one had at least a really great concept and lots of expectations, although in the end it was somewhat of a letdown and not what the trailer promised -- at least in my opinion.
