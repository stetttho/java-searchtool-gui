 Once again, Robinella delivers all the way. Robinella is one of those artists I wait patiently for her releases just like for Norah Jones' CDs, and now I can't wait for the next James Blunt release, but it often takes at least a couple of years by these artists for a new CD. Well, the "remake" of "Brand New Key" alone is worth the money for this whole CD -- Robinella does an excellent job with it and it's just an extraordinary musical experience to listen to this song and to most of the other songs. I remember the first time I listened to her first official public release I put the CD away and then I listened to it a few times to discover all the gems on it. There are really gems in each of her songs, and the musical arrangements are just superb. Many have a problem with defining her style and it's a little difficult other than it's great music and it may not be for everyone's taste, but you could call it perhaps a crossover Jazz Country Swing with a little shot of Blues. But who cares? Robinella's voice has this special magic to it and I really enjoy listening to her.
