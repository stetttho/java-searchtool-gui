 Hitchcock would have been proud of Robert Zemeckis as the director of this flick. Zemeckis used the little tricks of the suspense trade like a cracking of a door, spontaneous images and a loud noise during a quite scene, etc. to create a phenomenal thriller. The suspense is breathtaking and the whole concept has been perfectly executed. It didn't hurt that superb actors like Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer are starring in this movie who play their roles very good without a question. With the use of only a few special effects, the suspenseful atmosphere is communicated throughout the film and it's definitely a movie you want to watch over the years frequently, even though the initial surprise factors from the first viewing may have already disappeared. But Thriller is a cinematic experience and very well done.
