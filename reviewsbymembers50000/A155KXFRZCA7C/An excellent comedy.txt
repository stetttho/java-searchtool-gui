 This is one of these rare classic comedies you don't want to miss. You'll laugh your heart out. Through some odd circumstances a wealthy NYC developer (Tim Allen) gets in trouble with the IRS. Suddenly, he and his wife (Kirstie Alley) must flee from the authorities and they must leave their wealth behind. The couple ends up in Amish country and there they fake to be Amish cousins of a certain Amish family so that they can remain in hiding until their legal mess is cleared up. Everything's going crazy as the worldly couple tries to fit into this religious community. It's a fun movie and a laughfest so very rare these days. There's plenty of suspense as the IRS is closing in on their hide out, and we think "For Richer or Poorer" is one of the best comedies in years.
