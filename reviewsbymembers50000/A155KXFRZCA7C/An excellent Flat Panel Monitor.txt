 Dell is a trusted name in the industry and after we've used Dell computers since the early 90s, the top of the line Dells are the best performing and most reliable PCs out there, which are also competitively priced. This 19" Ultrasharp Flat-Panel monitor with its thin frame around it is a true 19" inch. It is crisp with no glare even in daylight -- I'm really positively surprised. As I'm spending 10-12 hours per day in front of the screen, staring at it, this Flat Panel works extremely well and easy on my eyes -- no more tears, etc. Its also light weight and it seems very sturdy with all kinds of adjustment features (incl. tilting in virtually all directions) to place it as comfortable as possible right where you want it. The colors are also really superb. Like with everything else we've researched a lot of monitors before we bought this Dell 1905fp UltraSharp and it seems to be the best unit for the money. In order to be comfortable working or having fun with/on the screen, make sure you're getting at least the 19" and the UltraSharp version which is just the perfect format and everything else as mentioned here, and it's also a very stylish futuristic unit. This monitor worked right out of the box and my PC recognized the hardware immediately automatically and adjusted it accordingly by itself. Excellent Flat-Panel Monitor!
