 If you want to hear the real raw talent of Lucinda Williams and her band, then this long overdue Live album is just what the doctor has ordered. Most of the great Lucinda songs are on it, and yes it's definitely on the edgy side, especially Lucinda's voice. The folks who complain about that instead of this live album she should have recorded this CD in a studio, well, may it be made known to all which most folks know anyway, that Lucinda accepts and persists usually on the first cut of her band in the studio too, and so this Live album does her and her band justice. The whole cut sounds like one from the early 70s like e.g. a Neil Young live cut or whatever -- it's unpolished and raw, but still tremendous quality of exceptional talent, far away from all the programmed commercial junk out there. This is great music from one of the best singer/songwriters in the world, with great lyrics and Lucinda Williams fans will love this double CD. New listeners will need a number of listenings to get acquainted with her style which is some alt-country mixed with some folk rock and bluesy stuff, but the listening-in period was true for new fans regarding her previous albums too. As Lucinda is touring this year (2005) try to get tickets to see her live, and you'll have a great musical experience that you won't forget for the rest of your life. That's the way how music shall be done and recorded.
