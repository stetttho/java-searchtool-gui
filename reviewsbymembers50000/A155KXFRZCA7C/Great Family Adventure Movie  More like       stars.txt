 This is an excellent family movie about an Antartica adventure. Although Jason Biggs of American Pie is in it, this time he's the usual goofball but without any stupid humor and not one bad word anywhere in the film. It's safe family entertainment. The story is about a scientific post in Antartica that uses eight Huskies to get around with selds in the snow-barren wilderness of the South Pole. Trouble starts for the dogs when Winter arrives early and the dogs have to survive by themselves which is documented in the film as is also the human aspect of leaving the dogs behind to fight for themselves. The scenery and photography is breathtaking and it is a well-made Disney movie. It is based on a true story and that makes it even more interesting. Don't compare this film to Snow Dogs as this film is not a comedy and the location, storyline and premise are completely different. Aside from the dogs as heros, Paul Walker plays the human hero and he plays the role of an expedition guide very believably. Some concepts of the human psyche which may have been intended to be communicated in this flick, clearly miss the mark as these are not communicated, but it doesn't matter ... it's a clean family movie which the juniors as well as dog lovers will really appreciate and enjoy. Also, a lot about the behavior and kindness/faithfulness of the four-legged friends is shown. My wife liked this film very much and she said the DVD once released is a definite buy. Although this movie is two hours long and there are some slow passages, the two hours don't seem like two hours at all. This film is about a very real adventure and it's well worth watching it.
