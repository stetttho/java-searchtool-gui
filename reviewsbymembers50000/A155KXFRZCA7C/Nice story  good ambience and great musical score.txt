 The story is cute ... a young pilot (Tom Cruise) has a romance with his flight instructor (Kelly McGillis). Along the way we get an inside view of the Top Gun clique. Great cinematography! Shots of fighter planes taking off on airplane carriers in the South China Sea, excellent combat scenes supported by a breathtaking soundtrack. In one scene Cruise is racing his motorcycle against a fighter jet on the runway at the backdrop of a sunset. If you own a fast car or convertible you must have the soundtrack, and the movie is fun to watch over and over again and it's a full entertainment experience. In our opinion, Top Gun is one of the best movies made in the 80s and should have its place in every DVD collection.
