 This is a great fun scooter, especially at this low price. It looks cool and stylish with its chrome/black trim. The Kickin' scooter also appears to be durable. It lacks a few convenient features which the popular Razor scooters and the competitive Stinger Scooter offer. But the Kickin' Mini Scooter adds a nice carrying bag and this comes handy. Compared to the Razor scooter the Kickin' scooter has an all steel frame while the Razor is made out of aluminium/alloy and that makes the Razor lighter and easier to maneuver, especially for smaller kids. While teenagers and adults may opt for the trendier Razor, the Kickin' scooter is a great alternative for kids and younger teenagers for around half the price of a Razor, although you may also want to check out the Stinger scooter which is also made out of a steel frame and has a more colorful trim if this is what you're looking for. Anyway, we like this scooter, especially at this low price.
