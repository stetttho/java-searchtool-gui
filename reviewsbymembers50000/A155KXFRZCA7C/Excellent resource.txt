 I definitely agree with the many readers regarding this book that it is absolutely the authorative source book on the subject of breast cancer. The author describes virtually every detail incl. the emotional aspects from prevention to diagnosis and through the healing process. I picked up a copy of this extensive book when one of my friends was diagnosed with breast cancer to be able to better relate to her and to understand what she's going through and I must say it is a very interesting read. Another excellent book on the subject that is really encouraging and helpful and I think is also a "Must-Read" is "Breast Cancer Be-Attitudes" by breast-cancer survior Sylvia Baker.
