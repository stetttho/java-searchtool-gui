 Indeed, this production of the Count of Monte Cristo is truly a breathtaking experience. The director, Josee Dayan, did a marvelous job. And so far, Gerard Depardieu's part as the Count of Monte Cristo is  certainly his career highlight as he shines with an exceptional perfomance.  Even though the movie is in French with English subtitles, nothing of the  tension and continuous action is lost throughout the eight hours running  time. There are no boring scenes in this film and the producers made every  minute count. The shoot took place on location throughout Europe which  produced even more originality and authenticity. And while it is a TV  mini-series, we're glad to say that this production comes across the screen  like a mega-budget motion picture. We think it's the best adaption of  Alexandre Dumas's novel to date. In addition to the great perfomances by  virtually every actor in this film, viewers will certainly also enjoy the  scenery, the set and the costumes. We must say that this motion picture is  an unforgettable adventure.
