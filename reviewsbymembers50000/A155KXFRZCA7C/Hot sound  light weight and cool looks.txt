 At this price this Gibson Flying V is a bargain. It looks cool, plays fast as the action is low, and it's light weight to get this axe easily rocking. I had my 10-year old play a little bit around on it, and he sounded like a like pro. I can't say enough good things about this cool axe, other than perhaps a tremolo would have been nice, and I like to mention that the Gibson Voodoo V made out of Swamp Ash was just a notch hotter in sound and the even lighter weight -- it was the ultimate V axe by Gibson and I hope they'll bring that one back some day. But for the time being, this Gibson Faded Flying V is good enough and once you play a few riffs on it, I think you too will fall in love with this axe.
