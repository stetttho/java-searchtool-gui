 With this film Mel Gibson provides the first accurate portrayal of the suffering of Christ as described in the Bible. This film is an absolute "Must-See" for anyone interested in the life of Jesus Christ. HE died for all of our sins (past, present, future) for every person in the world as we can see and hear clearly in the message of this "historical" cinematic document. Now it's no longer a sin issue, but instead it's a Christ issue: do I accept Him as my personal Savior or do I reject His finished work on the cross? Yes, the portrayal is brutal and it's a bloody affair, but that's how it was and Christ's blood was shed to pay the high price for all of our sins to redeem us and provide Eternal Life for whosoever believes in Jesus Christ as their personal Savior. The film is in the original languages which adds to the effectiveness of this film and with the combination of the vivid images Mel Gibson seems to bring the attentive viewer to the actual places as if a bystander at the events. Much attention has been given to all the details and it's a motion picture for the whole family. Aside from the true historic events, "The Passion of the Christ" is a tremendous cinematic achievement. We can thank Mel Gibson for going out by faith and putting up his own money to finance this film and for doing excellent research and sticking to the vision to bring the last few hours of Christ closer to many millions of people and to introduce them to a living faith in Jesus Christ.
