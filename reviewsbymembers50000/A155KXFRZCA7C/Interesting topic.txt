 We thought this movie brought an interesting and fresh behind-the-scenes look of today's secret societies, in this case one at an ivy league campus. The Skulls also shows how life long connections in business and politics are formed early on during this important time in college. And if we look at the real world of business and politics, we can easily figure out that this flick comes pretty close to reality. Granted, the plot is simple and the acting is often cliche, but the topic is very interesting and the movie was well executed as it keeps the viewer focused. We watched the movie together with folks who are easily bored and rarely consider a movie worth watching, but in the case of The Skulls they all responded with the request to watch it again and to purchase the DVD. There's just something about this movie that leaves the impression that after watching it you learned something and you had a great entertainment experience. And that's what it's all about.
