 I was very excited about Gretchen's follow-up to her debut CD. Well, aside from a very few songs, this CD is not really anything to get excited about. The songs seem to have been roughly cast together, just to come out with some additional material to cash in on Gretchen's momentum and success. Sure, there are a few excellent songs on this CD like "Skoal Ring" but there's just nothing fresh or exciting on this CD, although she remains true to her country roots with pedal steel guitar arrangements and the typical shot of rock with hot lead guitars. If I could, I would return this CD.
