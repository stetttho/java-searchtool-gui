 Fox really produced an amazing franchise with "24." Season One was phenomenal, but looking back it was only an intro to what was to come. Season Three is now the best thriller series ever and I can't wait for Season Four. Kiefer Sutherland is an excellent actor and in his role as CTU special agent Jack Bauer his talent shines in every aspect. It's amazing how much you can put into a 24 hours. As some of my friends haven't even seen a "24" Season yet, I had to get all the seasons and once they see just 15 minutes of it, they're hooked.
