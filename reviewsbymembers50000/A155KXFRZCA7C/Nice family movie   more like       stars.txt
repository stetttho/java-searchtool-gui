 My expectations were a little higher than what was finally delivered on the screen ... I was hoping for more laughs. The premise is good anyway and the moral of the story is actually excellent, -- that's why it got a star more than what I thought it deserved. It's basically clean fun. Goofball Robin Williams plays Bob Munro a type of financial/marketing guy (couldn't figure it out) and he's supposed to be on vacation with his family in Hawaii, but his boss needs Bob on a special meeting in Colorado in a few days. So Bob thinks of an alternative type of vacation to please his family but also his boss at the same time. And there it goes with lots of mishaps on the vacation of a lifetime. Robin Williams is excellent as usual and also the co-starring actors are doing a very good job. The script is well written and also the photography is pretty nice. There was one lady in the cinema who laughed her head off, but not too many other folks laughed too often. It's a popcorn crunching spoof for a Saturday afternoon which makes you think about your own family relationships and how you can re-establish the bonding.
