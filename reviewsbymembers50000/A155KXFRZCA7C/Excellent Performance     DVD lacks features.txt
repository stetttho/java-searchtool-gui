 I would have loved to give this DVD five stars, but there are no features on it, meaning there are no backstage interviews, or option for Widescreen, etc. And yes I know it was recorded at Austin City Limits for TV in December 1998, and actually the sound quality is excellent just as the photography is of high quality. It's a basic Lucinda Williams concert and she plays 16 of her until then created songs. Her voice to her songs, as well as her band, who are all top-notch professionals, are just phenomenal, but her stage presence is sometimes not easy on the eyes. It took full 6 songs til' the first few smiles came across as Lucinda just stood there without much action as if she was in some sort of pain and she sang her songs. Her guitarist Kenny Vaughan was more lively and added extra juice to her performance. Also, one of her guitarists looks like Eric Clapton, although it's not Clapton, and he too also plays pretty good, and that was a nice little touch on the side. Her live performance on this DVD sounds very similar to her studio version of the songs and at the end Lucinda delivered an extended version of "Joy" and an abbreviated version of "Can't Let Go." I think the studio version of "Can't let go" was much better on the album (Car Wheels on a Gravel Road), and it would have been nice if they had extended "Can't let go" instead of "Joy", but that's probably a matter of taste. Since it's the only DVD of Lucinda Williams out there, it is a "must" for every Lucinda Williams collection; and I also recommend her new and first live CD (2 CDs) "Live at the Fillmore" which is really excellent as it was recorded in November 2003, although the CD is a little bit on the edge side, but the "Fillmore CD" is a great CD.
