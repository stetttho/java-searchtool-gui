 While the "Jolie" video was somewhat haunting and interesting, it was the "Come to Jesus" music video that won me over to purchase this CD as well as Mindy's personal story, and a few listen-ins on some live performances on her website. Well, initally it seems as if this CD is basically a girl with a guitar CD, but it's a whole lot more than that. The songs are seeded with spiritual content and are carried not only by Mindy's angelic voice but also by excellent arrangements. There's this touch of country, bluegrass/newgrass, and the creative singer/songwriter atmosphere like on Jewel's first album. Listening to this CD it's time to sit down in a corner, just relaxing and watch the clouds pass by. While most of the CD is ideal for daydreaming, "Hard To Know" near the end of the album brings out Mindy's edgy stuff--it's really cool. Great talent!
