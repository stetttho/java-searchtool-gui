 Sure, we all remember Layla and Cocaine, and this album is definitely not along these lines. And even more surprising is the fact that while Clapton is one of the best blues guitarists ever, he doesn't emphasize his qualities in this regard on this album. The emphasis is clearly on the words of each song which are sensitive and which carry a very deep meaning ... and this makes "Pilgrim" so very special. And of course, the musical quality is there too, but those who remember Clapton from the old day so to speak, may not like this kind of Eric Clapton. The album starts right away with an excellent song titled "My Father's Eyes" and goes on with "River of Tears" and an excellent song called "Pilgrim" (Pilgrim for your love ...) and the "Broken Hearted" and one great song after another. The album leads to "She's Gone" which is a loaded edgy number with great guitar riffs. It took me several dozen times to listen to this CD to hear the excellent depth and thought that went into this production, and I gave it time to grow on me over a couple of years or so and now not a week goes by where I don't listen to it at least once. It's really an excellent album.
