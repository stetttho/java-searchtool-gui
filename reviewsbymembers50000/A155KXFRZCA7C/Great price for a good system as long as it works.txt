 For the unbelievable low price and the many features this unit promised, we couldn't resist and we just had to buy this system. And true, setup was quick and easy, and overall the sound was also very good for these relatively small satellite speakers. Just the speaker pair for the special effects was a little weak, but it was O.K. considering the low price. The best results came with playing music CDs over the system--I thought I was in a dance club and it was pretty powerful. After we watched about 10 DVDs over a couple of weeks or so, the DVD player started to have its problems as the picture became smudged. Then on the next viewing the screen had lines running in every direction and the picture was gone. After we checked all connections, we had to call the Norcent "Help"-Line which was answered immediately and the gentleman was friendly and helpful. After trying all possible fixes which were suggested by the Norcent Help-guy, nothing worked and the picture was not restored, and sadly we had to return the unit. It's a good deal and the product seems to be of acceptable sturdy quality, and as long as it works it can be enjoyed. But once a problem with the picture arises you may have to return the system unless you want to use it as a great sound system for your CDs--that might be worth it.
