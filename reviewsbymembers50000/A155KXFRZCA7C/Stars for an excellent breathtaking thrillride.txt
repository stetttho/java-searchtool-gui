 Where can you find a film that is rated PG with no foul language, no nudity and sensuality, etc. and it's still a fast-paced action thriller? These movies are hard to find and "National Treasure" delivers all the way. It's interesting and I almost gave the film 5 stars, but I'm no Nicolas Cage fan and that prevented me from awarding it 5 stars, but it's well worth 4 1/2 stars. Although some scenarios are a little unrealistic to say the least, it doesn't matter in this film as the subject matter is just so fascinating, ... a lost/hidden treasure and the symbolism surrounding it. On the big screen this motion picture was really exceptional and it's a breathtaking thrillride, but I haven't decided yet if this flick will make it into my DVD collection, but it probably will.
