 We all have the freedom to imagine whatever we want and to tell stories that may engage the reader, listener or viewer. Narnia has been hyped as a great Christian story for decades and I can't figure out what this story has to do with Christianity. A lion is supposed to symbolize God and then the resurrection? The good folks run around as half human and half horses; a young guy (Mr. Thomas) in his early twenties runs around topless as he is half human and the other lower part of his body is half animal (horse or whatever), and he's one of the good guys luring young Lucy -- a 7-year old or so -- into his home to offer her tea and then drug her to admit to her that against his will he must kidnap her ... C'mon. Then there are creatures and violence just like in the Lord of the Rings and young children should not watch this film as it should be better rated PG-13. By the way, my 12-year old son liked the movie ... not that he was extremely excited about it, but it was okay. Yes it's the fight between good and evil, and at its time when the story was first published some 50+ years ago, after the second world war it may have been something interesting for people to read because of the then lack of stories available and as it was the dawn of fantasy novels and so forth, but today? If you're a Christian don't think that you will watch any sort of Christian theme or story here other than that C.S. Lewis was a respected Christian and theologian, but you won't find much of it in this flick. If you do want to show your kids a Christian story let them watch Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" or Zeffirelli's "Jesus of Nazareth."
