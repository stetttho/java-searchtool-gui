 Many songs on this CD are in typical Van Morrison fashion. The first two songs are great and then again song number 7 with "Just Like Greta"; then it continues on from track 9-13 and all these songs are the typical nice ballads most Van Morrison fans will love to listen to. I thought the only kind of awkward songs were tracks 3-6 which should have been on a different CD album. But 8 great songs out of 13 in our day and age is pretty good, and then maybe one or the other song from the other group of songs is still interesting to hear. I would have loved to give this CD 5 stars and it would be even worth the 5 stars for such songs like "Stranded", "They Sold Me Out", "Celtic New Year", "Magic Time" etc., but as a whole CD album it's a solid 4 stars for me as I have to skip over some songs that I'm not too fond of.
