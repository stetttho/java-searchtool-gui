 This album may not turn the world upside-down, but the Country ballads and stories are once again in typical Alan Jackson fashion and that's what Alan Jackson fans want to hear. It's the consistency for so many years that's amazing. You could imagine yourself sitting at the fireplace on a cold winter day, or around the camp fire on a hot summer night, or driving along the endless highways and interstates of the Midwest and you'll never get tired of listening to Alan Jackson -- one song after another, just taking it in. With "What I Do" it's once again a nice addition to the Alan Jackson and for that matter any Country Music collection.
