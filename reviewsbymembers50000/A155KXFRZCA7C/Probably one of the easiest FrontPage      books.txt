 I've bought most FrontPage 2000 books written by various authors and publishers, but this one I use most. It is really easy to understand and that makes the Website design process fast! Easy graphics with efficient  text explain all the basic features as well as many of the advanced  features in a hurry. The content is nicely arranged and categorized. While  no book can be complete on the subject and I use several books as reference  for certain tasks, this book is excellent for quick learning, reference and  implementation of FrontPage 2000 to create very nice and  professional-looking Websites.
