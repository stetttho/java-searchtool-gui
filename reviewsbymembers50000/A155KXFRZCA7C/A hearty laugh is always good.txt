 When I first saw Billy Bass in a store I thought it was funny and I let go of a chuckle, but I never thought I'd buy it. Now I bought it, because of the effect it has on almost every person I introduce to Billy Bass. Sure it's a gimmick, but it's simply a fun toy that opens doors for conversations at parties, etc. Put Billy Bass in your game room or near the barbecue pit and I guarantee you, you will make new friends. People will quickly see your sense of humor and that allows instantly for an amicable atmosphere. By the way, I think this toy has educational value in the sense of teaching something about human nature as folks respond to Billy Bass. And Billy Bass looks very real. Have fun!
