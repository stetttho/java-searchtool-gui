 When I saw the first MI with Tom Cruise some years ago, I left the theatre disappointed. So my expectations for MI-2 weren't that high, but I was positively surprised by what I saw. Of course, let's be honest and let's forget about the story line ... we all know this movie is definitely not Oscar material. MI-2 is simply a hot action movie with excellent stunts, great cinematography, a powerful soundtrack and the movie comes across as a high-budget John Woo action picture. Sure, it appears that they heavily borrowed from all kinds of other action movies, but the compilation resulted in a fun and nerve-racking action adventure and experience. I liked it better than the last couple of James Bond movies. For action fans and for those who like a thrill ride with great stunts, it's definitely worth watching.
