 This CD sounds very genuine. If this is Lisa's style and she keeps this direction then she may become a "cult figure" sooner or later, especially if she comes out with some elaborate shocking music videos and tours with a suitable dramatic stage performance to support this album. I must say that I've outgrown Bowie some 25 years ago, but listening to this CD reminded me an aweful lot of Bowie's works around the mid 70s, ... and that's not bad for this type of sound, although the CD has a strong gloomy undertone and doesn't produce any happy feelings at all. And in order to deliver the goods to its fullest in this genre, it needs to be the whole package, which is still to be seen if this package will become available. It is rather easy to recognize the genuine effort Lisa Marie put into this album and it is really believable. This type of music is on the artsy side, especially for a 2005 release. But it demonstrates the desire to produce music that expresses true emotions and doesn't cater to commercial demands of the broader market -- so this CD can be considered a "work of art" -- maybe. Other than the need for an emotional expression, I just don't understand why it was necessary to release an explicit-lyrics version of this CD which I would never buy and I think most folks won't buy either. For now, there seems to be a lack of identity which may be defined with the next CDs. For the honesty of revealing her feelings to the world and for the effort I would give this CD 3 1/2 stars, but I don't see much entertainment value in it.
