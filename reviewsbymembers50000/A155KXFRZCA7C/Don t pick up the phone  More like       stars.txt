 Well, after you've seen this Saturday afternoon popcorn crunching flick, you sure don't wanna hear another phone ring. Just turn off the Cell and disconnect your land line. The ambience of the film is very well done although it's a little dark since the movie plays during the evening/night hours (duhhh!), but it's very stylish from the unique house and setting on the lake, etc. The film reminded me on highschool thrillers from and/or set in the 70s, because there are no real special effects and most of the thrill is provoked by scary looks, ambience, doors slamming and other loud noises during silent scenes as well as an excellent sometimes overwhelming score, and then the chase scenes like running through a dark forrest and the stranger almost catching the babysitter -- (I don't want to give away too much although the trailer already has anyway). There are scenes where you may want to close your eyes because you're expecting something horrific to happen -- the tension is there. Camilla Belle does an excellent job for her not even 20 years of age and she's the star of this movie and she would have either made or broke this flick -- a big risk for the director and the producers. But Camilla is brilliant and her acting is excellent for this type of film and I'm sure this film is going to add a big notch to her career -- we're not talking Oscar or anything, but just the fear and panic that she communicates is so believable. Well, it's a nice little scary movie for a Saturday afternoon and it's surprisingly well done.
