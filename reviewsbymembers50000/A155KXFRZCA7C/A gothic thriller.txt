 We think that Tim Burton produced the legend of Sleepy Hollow in the best format and the best way anyone could. This is certainly not a real horror movie, but more a type of gothic thriller with humor to ease the tension. That doesn't mean that the movie is lacking shocking scenes, because there are several scenes not suitable for individuals with heart problems. Francis Ford Coppola is the executive producer and we know he did Dracula a few years ago. The effects are very good, except for Johnny Depp being squirted with blood a few too many times, but since it's Depp it's not that annoying. Sleepy Hollow communicates the mood of a gothic thriller through its cinematography and with the supporting soundtrack very well. It almost appears to be a black and white movie, but of course it isn't, as some of the important colors emphasize certain situations, and they did a very professional job at it and this comes across very good. The musical score is also just perfect for this movie and adds a lot to tell the story and to communicate the dark, terrifying mood. We enjoyed the movie and during this season it's certainly the right movie to watch.
