 I bought several books on how GarageBand works and while some had some helpful hints, the author of this book, Bob LeVitus, knows what he's talking about. Every sentence and page has valuable advice on how this thing, "GarageBand", really works. He also includes the limitations of GarageBand and alternative software suggestions for more elaborate recording needs. The author is very knowledgable about home-studio recording and he has excellent suggestions on microphones, speakers, and inexpensive technical gear incl. audio interfaces, etc. that will make your recording project a professional adventure. This book is so interesting and has so many useful tips, etc. that everyone playing around with GarageBand should read it in order to easily use this Apple application and to get the most out of it -- saving you a lot of frustration at the same time.
