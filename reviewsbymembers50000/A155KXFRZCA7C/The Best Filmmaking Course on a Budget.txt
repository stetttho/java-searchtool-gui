 I always love to learn about subjects that interest me, and even though I may have read through dozens of books on a subject to gain the maximum know-how about it, it's always a thrill to pick up a read that is truly superb. Bryan M. Stoller, the author of Filmmaking for Dummies, has accomplished one of the best jobs on this subject matter that I've found so far over the years. He's categorical and precise and I'd call it the best Filmmaking Course on a budget. The reader can learn in this inexpensive book just as much as in many 8-week filmmaking courses that often cost thousands of dollars and the good part is that with this book you already have the notes printed in front of you. The author offers a volume of resources discussing the differences of using actual film vs. video and new 24fps digital camcorders like the Panasonic AG-DVX100 Cinema Camera. He has excellent chapters on lighting, sound and camera filters, as well as on the commercial aspect of idependent film distribution and film festivals, etc. This is a very practical, right-to-the point book and it's an enormous resource from a qualified guy who's been interested in filmmaking for a long time and who has at least 20 years of on-hand in-the-field experience. Stoller also offers very helpful Website addresses for further information, even where to buy or rent equipment, etc., etc. Every aspiring and even professional filmmaker will definitely benefit from this book. Amazingly, this book is so updated as if it was just written a few weeks ago including the newest technological developments regarding digital film formats.
