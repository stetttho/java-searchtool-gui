 I have to admit conservative muckraker Ann Coulter's vitriol has a certain anti-Will Rogers cynicism that makes me smirk at times. But unfortunately this book does not use her self-conscious wit as the basis for a serious treatise on challenging the liberal agenda. Instead, as a self-professed polemicist, Coulter presents a collection of her columns as if they were part of a stand-up comedy act on the Fox News Channel. Her efforts to stir the pot in this book should be the basis of some hardball discussion, as we desperately need to have constructive political arguments. Sadly you won't find any of that here. Instead, Coulter uses the same sarcastic, piecemeal approach that Maureen Dowd does with "Bushworld: Enter at Your Own Risk", but at least Dowd attempts to paint a picture with more depth than her individual columns, and despite her didactic Bush-whacking, is relatively even-handed in her distribution of one-liners against Republicans and Democrats alike.  Without the realization of a bipartisan world, Coulter can be very hit-and-miss in getting her points across. Some of her zingers land squarely on their target, e.g., "A reporter asked Kerry, `Are you for or against gay marriage?' As usual, his answer was, `Yes.'" Some just don't have much relevance except to reflect her insatiable need to be clever, e.g., Coulter describes the liberal mindset as "The absolute conviction that there is one set of rules for you, and another, completely different set of rules for everyone else." And just how does that statement not describe a conservative? I will give credit to Coulter for being consistent in her perspective, but if you are looking for well-earned laughs at the expense of both parties, I suggest you pick up Jon Stewart's "America: A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction".
