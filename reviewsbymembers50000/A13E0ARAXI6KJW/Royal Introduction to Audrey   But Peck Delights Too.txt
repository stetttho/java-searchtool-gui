 In a beautifully restored print, this fairy tale movie provides a most enchanting introduction to the then-24 year old actress thanks mainly to director William Wyler's expert direction and Dalton Trumbo's sweetly observant script. In hindsight, it is a modest performance compared to Hepburn's later work, but Wyler knew enough to let her natural breeding serve its purpose in conveying the carriage of a princess. The approach works wonderfully, as she is perfectly believable as a royal who experiences her first glimpse into the world outside her hermetically sealed world. One can see her star rising most precipitously throughout this film, even in scenes as seemingly minor as the one where she sits on the Spanish Steps breathlessly describing her perfect day. Nonetheless, the revelation here is really Gregory Peck, handsome and stalwart as always but in this movie, quite relaxed with a surprising light comedy touch. It is actually his Joe Bradley that goes through the dramatic character arc from opportunistic reporter to smitten commoner that makes the ending so bittersweet.  Even though this film is hardly mentioned in the same breath as his other classics like "Wuthering Heights" or "The Best Years of Our Lives", Wyler's humanistic touch is everywhere - from the comic haircutting scene with the smitten barber to the famous Mouth of Truth scene where Peck pretends to lose his hand to the concluding press conference, which turns into a dance of acting nuance and unspoken feelings. This DVD has some nice extras, including an excellent documentary on the production itself (watch for Hepburn's first Hollywood screen test) and other short films on the film's restoration process and Edith Head's contribution to movie costuming. A lovely reminder of what great stars Hepburn and Peck were during Hollywood's golden age.
