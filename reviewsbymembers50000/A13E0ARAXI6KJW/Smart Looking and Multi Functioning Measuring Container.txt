 I have to admit I first saw this accessory as I was watching Food Network personality Alton Brown use it on his informative program, "Good Eats". When I saw it up close, I noticed its conical design and narrow base allows detailed markings for six measures - cups, fluid ounces, pints, teaspoons, tablespoons, milliliters per cubic centimeter (ml/ccm). It's ideal for those recipes that combine measures, e.g., "one cup plus two tablespoons of sugar". It has a lip for relatively easy pouring, though I would have preferred a more defined spout.  If you fumble around a kitchen drawer, like me, looking for the individual measuring cups and tablespoon and teaspoon only to face washing them all later after use, then this is a tool worth purchasing. The design is attractive enough to leave on the counter, and the acrylic material also makes it lightweight. I was just praising whoever designed it in my review of "The Design of Things to Come" by Craig M. Vogel, Jonathan Cagan and Peter Boatwright because the Perfect Beaker transforms a typical cooking utensil into an ideal combination of aesthetics and function. If for the next version, the designer could figure out how one could measure out wet and dry ingredients interchangeably in one beaker, then this would be the perfect kitchen tool. I also think a larger version of the Perfect Beaker, perhaps in a stackable mode with the original, could be produced for recipes requiring larger proportions.
