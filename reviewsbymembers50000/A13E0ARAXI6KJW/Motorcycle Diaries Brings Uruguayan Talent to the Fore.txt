 Uruguayan singer/composer Jorge Drexler wrapped his delicately warm voice around a gently strummed guitar on "Al Otro Lado del Rio", the yearning song that accompanied the closing credits of Walter Salles' wondrous road movie, "The Motorcycle Diaries". It was a fitting ending to a beatific film, and he won a surprise Oscar for Best Song. It seems inevitable that a solo recording would be released in conjunction with that celebratory moment, although ironically Drexler was denied the opportunity to sing it on the actual Oscar telecast in favor of famed non-singer Antonio Banderas.   Produced by Drexler, along with Juan Campodnico, and Carlos Casacuberta, this disc is certainly good enough to attract new fans to Drexler, whose voice reminds me of a Latin-tinged blend of James Taylor and Michael Franks. Leisurely paced but impeccably produced, the Spanish-language songs are genuinely melodic if a bit monotonous at times. The title track and "Todo Se Tranforma" are nice slices of pop music, the first with a sweeping rhythmic feel and the latter punctuated by electronic percussion and echoing backing vocals. Both seem rather trivial compared to the mostly spoken word anthem, "Guitarra y Vos", a surprisingly affecting song. "Transporte" picks up the pace, and nice syncopated backbeats make "Milonga Del Moro Judo" and "Polvo De Estellas" percolate with calculated abandon. "Se Va, Se Va, Se Fue" has an oddly retro feel with its tick-tock backbeat and overly dramatic string arrangements.  "Salvapantallas" is a lovely song performed very sweetly, and "Al Otro Lado del Rio" provides an appropriate closer. The overall effect is alternately tranquil and percussive with an insinuating rhythm that is downright irresistible. Highly recommended.
