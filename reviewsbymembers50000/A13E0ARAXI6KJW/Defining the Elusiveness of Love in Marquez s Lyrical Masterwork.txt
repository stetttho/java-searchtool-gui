 Having just enjoyed his latest work, "Memories of My Melancholy Whores", I was strongly encouraged to read this 1985 novel. I'm glad I did as author Gabriel Garci?a Marquez captures the pain of unrequited love with alternating strokes of poetry and realism in a time-spanning treatment of a love triangle that begins in the late 19th century and ends in 1930. The triangle is composed of tortured poet Florentino Ariza, the grounded Dr. Juvenal Urbino and the inevitable woman in between, Fermina Daza. Characters and images flow in and out of the story with fluidity as Florentino pines secretly for the married Fermina over the course of fifty years.  In a manner that reminds me of the way Edith Wharton details the disquieting attraction between Newland Archer and Countess Olenska in "The Age of Innocence", Marquez vividly illustrates the suffering that comes from Florentino's emotional exile when he views love as an abstract, nostalgic feeling until by chance, his love is on the verge of being fulfilled. While the author is expert in painting a picture of love that verges on noble, he doesn't shy away from the more ludicrous aspects that keep the highly dramatic Florentino from his destiny. In fact, there are parts of the book that are quite humorous, for instance, in the awkward park meeting between the teenaged Florentino and Fermina when the birds leave droppings on her embroidery, and much later, when Florentino eats Fermina's flowers simply to absorb her scent. Overall, Marquez maintains an insinuating lyrical tone, and it doesn't change an iota when Florentino emerges from his imaginary world to conquer Fermina. The beauty of the book comes from how the author painstakingly paints three fully embodied characters in a story where love is portrayed in all its elusive forms. This is a stunning novel by a true master.
