 It's been 18 years since Basia's first stateside hit, "Time and Tide", a jazz-pop anomaly that served up her sonorous vocals in a snappy love anthem punctuated by piano breaks. The Polish-born chanteuse is back after an 11-year recording break with her old band, Matt Bianco, and it's great to hear that voice insinuate itself into some very seductive, Brazilian-style nightclub music. As much credit has to go to vocalist Mark Reilly and keyboardist Danny White, who co-wrote all the songs with Basia, and together they perform in such an infectious manner that it reminds me of Sergio Mendes and Brasil 66 in their sixties heyday.  Both the opener "Ordinary Day" and "Say the Words" sound like classic Basia with their hip clubby coolness, the latter with nice call-and-response vocalizing between her and Reilly. Reilly himself shines on "Golden Days" surrounded by Kevin Robinson's sixties-sounding trumpets and flugelhorn, and on the finger-snapping "Kaleidoscope". "La Luna" and "Ronnie's Samba" both have that bouncy bossa nova tempo that is pretty irresistible. On the Euro-chic "Slip and Sliding", White's organ playing and the late Ronnie Ross' saxophone solo add nice Casino Royale-style swing to what is essentially a jump piece, and the sole instrumental, "Matt's Mood III", is quite a happening number that travels at a quickening pace. Even though the material has a retro tinge to it and a certain sameness does creep in at times, the performances are all very fresh and alive and warrant more attention than background at a cocktail party. Highly recommended.
