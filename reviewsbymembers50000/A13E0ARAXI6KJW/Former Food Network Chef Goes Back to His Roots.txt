 Cuban cuisine mixes Caribbean and Latin flavors that turn into some truly memorable dishes. From personal experience, I also find it one of the more difficult cuisines to pull off honestly because one mistake can turn a dish into something generic or worse, unsalvageable. I had enjoyed the personable, fun-loving chef Alex Garcia on the Food Network for several years, as he co-hosted the Nuevo Latino cuisine segments on the dearly departed "Melting Pot" series. I even had the privilege of meeting him and tasting his food firsthand at his rather pricey midtown Manhattan restaurant, Babalu. That's why I had been anticipating his cookbook ever since he mentioned writing it over two years ago. Fortunately the result is a beautifully photographed and tantalizing cookbook with tasty recipes from his native Cuba.  I can vouch for the quality of several of the recipes since many of them were featured on his old series, and I have tried them successfully. The carne mechada (Cuban-style beef stew) is quite hearty and a crowd favorite. Also excellent are the arroz con gandules (pigeon pea rice) and the platnos en tentacin (roasted sweet plantains). His mojito recipe is fool-proof. Granted some of the native ingredients are hard to find, if not impossible, in some parts of the country, but reasonable substitutes are provided in the recipes. My one disappointment with the book is that even though Garcia writes the introduction, his personality is strangely missing from the book, which is a shame since that's what drew me initially to his cooking. Otherwise this is a fine starter for anybody who wants to give Cuban cooking a try. Along the same lines, I also recommend his former TV co-host Aaron Sanchez's versatile cookbook, "La Comida del Barrio", which focuses on Latin American cuisine as  done here in the barrios stateside.
