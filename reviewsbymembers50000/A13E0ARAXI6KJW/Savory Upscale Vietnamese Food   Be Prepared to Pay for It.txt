 I have tried the Slanted Door at each of its three successive locations, though I have to admit that my experience last night with visiting friends in its newest and (I assume) permanent location was less than ideal. While the epitome of modern minimalist design, it's a cavernous, noisy place hardly compatible with the delicate flavors of its exquisite menu. Granted it is located in the creatively renovated Ferry Building and has a nice view of the Bay Bridge, its expanded size bespeaks its immense popularity among locals and tourists as the center of upscale Vietnamese food in San Francisco. As the place, regardless of its location, is always buzzing with activity, I had never been overly impressed with the service, though on this occasion, the hostess deserves kudos for seating us without reservation.  But the Slanted Door knows where to place its priorities...the food. The dinner menu does not disappoint starting with a surprisingly spicy house specialty, the Slanted Door spring rolls. We also shared a dish called "shaking beef", which were cubed filet mignon with garlic and red onions; the grilled ahi tuna complete with a spicy ginger fish sauce; and my personal favorite, the crispy five-spiced Liberty Farm duck legs, which were mixed with lots of root vegetables in a tasty broth.  All were tasty and easy to share. Of course we had steamed rice, but we also chose an accompaniment of Star Route Farm baby spinach covered with an optimal mix of shallots and garlic. They provided subtle flavors that complemented the entre dishes well. Unfortunately, the Slanted Door does not excel at desserts, at least the ones we ordered, as the chocolate pot de crme had an almost Jell-O-like blandness and the milk pudding suffered the same fate though at least it was offset by a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds. Although there are a number of places in less desirable areas of the city that may serve equally hearty Vietnamese fare, I'm sure I will return to the Slanted Door when I have a reason to celebrate with friends and want a well turned, somewhat more expensive meal of the same variety.
