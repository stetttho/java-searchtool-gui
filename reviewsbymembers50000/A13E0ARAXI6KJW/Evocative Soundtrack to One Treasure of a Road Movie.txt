 I think a major part of my attraction to Takeshi Kitano's affectionately oddball 1999 road movie, "Kikujiro", has to do with composer Joe Hisaishi's soundtrack. The music - which would not be out of place on the more meditative Windham Hill roster - is based on the infectious piano-driven theme, and the forty minutes presented here are mostly variations on that same theme. Reminiscent of Dave Grusin's mid-eighties work (in particular, "Mountain Dance" from 1984's "Falling in Love"), Hisaishi's "Summer" has the same type of syncopated keyboard-led rhythm complemented by strings that are alternately plucked and played.  The best that can be said of the theme is that it perfectly evokes the image of nine-year old Yusuke Sekiguchi as Masao running purposefully on the bridge with the angel wings of his baby-blue knapsack flying in the breeze. Hisaishi even includes a percussive, Asian-flavored version called "Mad Summer". There are other tracks that serve to color the atmosphere of certain scenes in the film such as Masao's nightmare after being nearly molested (the synthesizer-heavy "Nightmare"), the heartbreaking moment he sees his mother in the distance (the delicate "Mother") and the bonding that occurs between Masao and Kikujiro on the beach (the poignant "Angel Bell").  Even though there are several beautiful interludes, the soundtrack will seem repetitive for anyone who hasn't seen the film. However, the music captures the emotional impact of the film for anyone who did enjoy it thanks to Hisaishi's craftsmanship.
