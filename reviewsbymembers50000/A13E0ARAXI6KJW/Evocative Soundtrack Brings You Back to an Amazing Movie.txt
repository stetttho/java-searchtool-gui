 I've read the book. I've seen the movie. Now I've heard the soundtrack. "The Motorcycle Diaries" could very well become a cottage industry. Luckily, this disc turns out to be a lovely evocation of the roundabout trek that Ernesto (Che) Guevara took with his best buddy Alberto Granado from their native Buenos Aires to Caracas in 1952, well before he became an icon for Communist revolutionaries in underdeveloped countries.  Argentinean composer Gustavo Santaolalla (who also scored "Amores Perros") has perfectly captured their impassioned spirits on the open road as they experience the elements and meet the people that change their lives. Santaolalla's beautiful score is seamlessly dream-like and rugged, the perfect background travel music as it draws on a variety of flavors in Latin music. Though mainly guitar-led instrumentals, the recording also has jazz and rock elements driven by African drums and Latin rhythms. I agree with the consensus that says his music sounds a bit like Ry Cooder, and I'd also add Earl Klugh and the Buena Vista Social Club for good measure. There are a couple of memorable vocal numbers such as the charming "Chipi Chipi" (where Guevara and Granado dance with the Chilean locals who think they are celebrity doctors) and the melancholy last track, "Al Otro Lado del Ro", sung by Jorge Drexler. This fusion of traditional and contemporary sounds is flawlessly mastered by the composer and works for the listener whether you have seen the film or not. But of course if you have seen the film by Walter Salles, you will certainly have the benefit of being taken back to the images of that mesmerizing cinematic work. Speaking of which, there is a nice booklet of diary quotes and photos from the film included with the CD. It would have been nice to have a little more variety among the tracks and also been helpful to tell us where each track plays specifically in the film, but these are minor quibbles. This is quite a poetic soundtrack.
