 Like everyone else who was not familiar with rai, the Algerian-based percussive musical movement that has cut a wide swath in world music, I was introduced to Cheb Mami through his provocative singing on Sting's "Desert Rose". Upon a friend's recommendation, I bought this disc and was pleasantly surprised by its diversity and from-the-heart musical expression. While it does have that spice bazaar vibe that may seem alienating to those less amenable to what could be considered a niche market, the recording also presents a spirited mix of sounds - reggae, techno, gospel - without appearing to compromise the rai style Cheb Mami is attempting to spread worldwide.  Mami sings with seemingly great abandon with his recognizable falsetto voice, and it is this bravado that carries this highly rhythmic disc. He has assembled an impressive list of world-class musicians to help him - the late Chet Atkins, Omar Hakim, Nile Rodgers, Nitin Sawheny and in a fair trade deal, Sting. Most of the tracks are definitely ear-catching, but three stand out on their own - "Rim Lachoua", which has traces of Rodgers' late seventies-era sound mixed with a percolating bass/accordion combination; "Ana Oualache", a gospel number in an exotic setting that succeeds thanks to Indio-Anglo mixmaster Sawheny's blend of Mami's elevated voice with a back-up chorus (including Sting), string section, and digital beats; and best of all, the opening song, "Le Rai C'est Chic", which mixes his voice with some synthesized vocals that is irresistibly danceable. "Dellali" is a worthy introduction to rai-fusion, including exotic instruments like the djembe and derbouka, and certainly to the mesmerizing voice of Mami. Highly recommended for the more musically adventurous.
