 For those looking for a well-turned, moderate-to-expensively priced dinner close to the theater district and Lincoln Center, this unassuming American bistro does a nice job. You would hardly notice the restaurant on 60th Street even if it does have a prime location near Columbus Circle simply because the massive Time Warner building complex dwarves it. Yet, you can get a fine pre-theater meal even if the sight of four (count 'em, four) hostesses seems a bit overwhelming. My friend and I were there at around 5:30PM, and a number of guests in their theater finery were already well into their meals.  It's a relatively small place, tastefully appointed...just the type of place that wealthy, older Upper West Siders are bound to go to avoid the crowds. A little more pizzazz in their decor wouldn't hurt as there was no one remotely hip in the place (a lot of fur and sequins...and on women, no less), but fortunately the food is quite good. My friend had the pappardelle with quail and mushrooms in a light cream sauce. It was tasty and the noodles had a nice consistency. But I have to say my order was superb...butternut squash ravioli in a brown butter sauce that was almost decadently flavorful. Our waiter was quite nice and attentive and not the patronizing sort one would expect from such a place. This is definitely an option to consider before a performance at the Met or a Broadway show.
