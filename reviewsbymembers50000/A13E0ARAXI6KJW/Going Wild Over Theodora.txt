 If you are fortunate enough to buy this DVD, you will see that Peter Sellars certainly lives up to his reputation as an avant-garde innovator. Certainly it can be a gamble to invest in his visions. However, there is no such risk with his 1996 staging of Handel's "Theodora". Not only does he not disappoint, he creates an intensely creative and heartfelt modern-day update of what has to be one of the saddest stories about the power of faith in a world of bad governments. Now eight years have elapsed since this staging, and the theme resonates more than ever.  The minimalist set acts as a subtle counterpoint to an astonishing cast. Really impressive is Lorraine Hunt, who sings in that burnished mezzo-soprano range that fits her role so well. What I appreciated most about her performance is that she got the drama of what was essentially an observational role without calling undue attention to her character. When you have five great voices competing for your attention, obviously that is not a minor accomplishment.  The real standout, however, is David Daniels. The countertenor voice is an acquired taste for many, but his full and rich voice will convert even the most jaded. He brings a melting, haunting quality to his performance from his first outstanding aria to the final heartbreaking ending where Sellars uses an almost clinical approach to the inevitable. It was obviously a star-making performance for Daniels, and he completely delivers the goods. The results are devastating.  If you are a non-opera buff...if you are leery of stories with heavy Christian themes...if you are afraid of the 207-minute running time, fear not, as this is no depressing, fundamentalist history lesson marathon...they even sing in English!  This is an amazing piece that has to be experienced. As for the DVD itself, the picture quality is crisp and clean, and the sound quality nice and deep. An excellent job and well worth the investment even if you already own the VHS tape.
