 As with "Running With Scissors", the twisted sense of humor is evident again in Augusten Burroughs' new collection of essays, which are tied around the theme of "magical thinking", or the belief that you have more influence over things that happen to you than you actually do. I suppose the inevitable comparisons with David Sedaris must grow tiresome for Burroughs (and probably for Sedaris as well), but the short story format he uses this time does make me wonder whether he is trying to one-up his literary colleague. Luckily, Burroughs infuses enough of his mordant wit and self-deprecating humor to make me appreciate his individual style much more than I could with the more challenging "Running With Scissors". Optimizing mind over matter certainly has its share of benefits, as the author is able to will his psycho-hag boss to her death, a story that I am ashamed to say induced not disgust but rather humorous empathy from me. But this power has its pitfalls as he listens in disgust to an adoring fan talk about the effectiveness of Dr. Pepper enemas in an anecdote about the strangely supernatural.  Burroughs is also more comically frank about his sexual escapades this time around perhaps freed by the "magical thinking" theme, as he recounts among many others, a spiritual young man with a sad case of "micro-penis". But the biggest surprise is that he does manage he literary balancing act of being both amusing and dare I say, sweet, in his account of finding true love with his boyfriend. I'm not sure if Burroughs' editors encouraged him to be more accessible with these stories, but the result is worthwhile and hardly compromised. Even if you have reservations after reading "Running With Scissors", and even if you are devoted to Sedaris (as I am), I say give Burroughs another try with this one. Like me, you might find yourself pleasantly surprised.
