 I am now on my sixth year of subscription of this magazine, and I continue to enjoy it immensely.  When I first read it, I knew the branding of "National Geographic" would mean exquisite, world-class photography, and based on this attribute alone, the "Traveler" edition does not disappoint. The target here though is not the anthropologist, the historian or even the cultural dilettante - it is the middle to upper middle class tourist in need of inspiration and pointers on travel. This is definitely not a backpacker's guide. This magazine is for those who have graduated from Rick Steves' backdoor guides but are not in dire need of an agent to help them plan their itineraries.  The various regular features always seem useful: "Smart Traveler" contains great insight into learning from other travelers' mistakes, or the best places to go for a given time of year; "Place of a Lifetime" spotlights an exotic fantasy place that makes you savor the idea of actually experiencing it firsthand; " 48 Hours" takes a given locale and tells you how to make the most of your limited time. Each issue focuses on one or two particular places and generally do a through job in highlighting what to see, where to stay and eat and a helpful street map is always provided. By comparison, "Travel and  Leisure" seems to focus on the trendy and chic, and the articles in "Conde Naste Traveler" seem abbreviated and not very informative. Moreover, both seem overstuffed with advertisements.  "National Geographic Traveler" just seems to have the right balance of great, easy-to-follow information and beautiful photography. I'm sure I'll be subscribing for many more years to come.
