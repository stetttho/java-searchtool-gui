 When I need to think of a nice place to eat in San Francisco, a city renowned for its many fine eateries, I have often defaulted to Delfina in the last few years. I remember how impressed I was with the unearthly succulence of the roasted Fulton Valley chicken the first time I was there. I can tell you I just shared it with a friend this evening, and it's still the most perfectly cooked chicken in the city. We also had the equally impressive Niman Ranch steak done to an ideally tender medium rare. Both had perfect accompaniments, creamy mashed potatoes with the chicken (it has to be served on a separate plate since the portions are so large) and the just crisp enough French fries with the steak. Now those are just two of the mouth-watering entrees. We actually began with a hearty potato and white bean pancake, peasant fare done up gourmet style, and an escarole salad with figs and hazelnuts. Both were superb starters. There was also a nice $32 bottle of a lovely cabernet-merlot wine with a nice vanilla finish..I only wished I wrote down the name of it. Our only disappointment was the somewhat overcooked green beans mixed with bacon and red peppers, which we felt looked like it belonged in one of the old aluminum trays that held Swanson's TV dinners in the sixties. Luckily, dessert got our meal back on track as we shared a lovely panna cotta with raspberries and a crispy tart with a vanilla gelato. We also had small pots of their specialty herbal teas, which made for the ideal finish to the meal.  Even though they doubled their original space, the place still gets quite packed nightly. You will be sitting almost elbow-to-elbow with the adjacent diners. Just don't get too territorial and you'll be fine. You need to make a reservation at least a few hours in advance to get a table, and while the bar is an option, I have to admit the seats there are not all that comfortable. The wait staff is pleasant and seems knowledgeable enough about both the food and wine menus. Unless you eat early, parking can be a problem. They offer a parking lot about a block and a half away, but it costs $8. Better to monitor the streets for your lucky break. I've had the best luck parking on 18th Street beside the tennis courts in Dolores Park. Regardless of the logistical inconveniences, this is a superb dining experience worth repeating again and again.  FOOD ****1/2 AMBIENCE ***1/2 SERVICE **** OVERALL ****
