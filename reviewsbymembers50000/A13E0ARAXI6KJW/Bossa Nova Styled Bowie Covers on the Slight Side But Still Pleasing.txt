 I have to admit that Brazilian musician/actor Seu Jorge made his most vivid impression on me as favela hero Knockout Ned in the viscerally powerful "City of God" directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund. However, his role as the red-capped troubadour in Wes Anderson's "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou" is memorable if only for his character's seemingly anachronistic renditions of the David Bowie songbook. Performed in Portuguese with just his guitar as accompaniment, the songs are transformed by Jorge's scratchy, emotive baritone and easy, often joyous strumming into acoustic bossa nova-style ballads. Depending on your reverence to Bowie, this recording is either an act of glam rock sacrilege or a fresh retake on the Thin White Duke's Ziggy Stardust-era output. Bowie himself seems to like it according to the liner notes.  Of the fourteen tracks, thirteen of which are Bowie covers, some are intoxicating in unexpected ways, for instance, "Changes" has morphed into a languid, loungey cousin to that girl from Ipanema, and "Life On Mars?" becomes a most melancholy visit to the red planet (For a more polarizing interpretation, take a listen to Barbra Streisand's bombastic 1974 cover of the same song). He appropriately shows off more of an edge on "Rock n' Roll Suicide" and "Queen Bitch". The best track may be the penultimate "Quicksand" in which Jorge more easily finds the song's idiosyncratic atmospheric tone and rhythm. His lone self-penned composition on the disc, "Team Zissou", is a percolating song complete with falsetto verses that sound just right next to the Bowie tracks. This is an enjoyable if rather slight recording and a nice introduction to a talented musician on the world scene.
