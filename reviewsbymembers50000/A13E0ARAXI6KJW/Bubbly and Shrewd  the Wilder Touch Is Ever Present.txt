 With its cynical humor and the European-based sensibilities around different classes, this is most definitely a Billy Wilder picture. Truth be told, it is not quite in the same league as other Wilder classics like "Sunset Boulevard", "Some Like It Hot" or "The Apartment", but on its own, it's an airy souffl of a comedy served on a perfectly lovely warming dish. What I like most about this movie is that Wilder keeps the fairy tale trappings of the story grounded in mordant wit and shrewd observations about business mergers, bribery and class snobbery. This is what keeps this movie surprisingly fresh today and why I assume it was ripe for a remake by Sydney Pollack. But only Wilder is capable of making a suicide scene in an extra large multi-car garage slyly funny or a discussion about class differences between a chauffeur and his employer seem mutually patronizing.  Torn between the characters played by her leading men, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, Hepburn as a chauffeur's daughter is charming. This was her first introduction to Givenchy fashion onscreen, and the difference in her appearance between "Roman Holiday" and "Sabrina" is actually more startling than the one in the movie itself. It is no wonder she became such a style icon from that point forward. With his street-savvy screen persona oddly out of place within the blue-nose Long Island surroundings, Bogart comes across as rather dour in his role of older brother Linus, a role ideally pegged for Cary Grant who canceled at the last minute...damn the luck. On the other hand, Holden is hilariously breezy as shallow, ne'er-do-well younger brother David. I always wished he did more comedy during his lengthy career. The ending is inevitable, but leave it to Wilder to mix sweet and sour better than a Cantonese restaurant. The DVD also includes a brief making-of documentary.
