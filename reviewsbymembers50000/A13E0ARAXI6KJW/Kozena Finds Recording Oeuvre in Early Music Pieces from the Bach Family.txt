 Although she stumbled a bit on her last recital CD, "Songs" (which covered disparate song cycles from the first half of the 20th century), Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena seems a stronger match for this early music program devoted almost exclusively to members of the Bach family. With her powerfully sculpted voice, she is a masterful interpreter of Baroque music especially as she lights into her higher soprano range. Kozena opens most vibrantly with her opening lament, Johann Christoph Bach's "Ach, dass ich Wassers g'nug hatte", which puts voice to a sinner's guilt. There is a striking series of cantatas, "Languet anima mea", by Viennese court composer Francesco Bartolomeo Conti (not a relative but someone who apparently held favor with Johann Sebastian Bach), which closes with a stirring coloratura run of "Alleluja".  The centerpiece - and certainly the most accomplished piece here - is by the master himself, J.S. Bach's "Vergnuegte Ruh, beliebte Seelenlust" which showcases Kozena's dramatic acumen and luminous tone. He also contributes a lighter aria which is actually a song of praise upon seeing the baby Jesus, "Bekennen will ich seinen Namen", that makes fine use of two interweaving violins. Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach's "Selma" brings out her expressive range in an affecting manner though the aria is quite brief. Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach's "Die Amerikanerin" seems a bit anticlimactic, as it doesn't have the compelling drama of his father J.S. Bach's work, but Kozena lends intelligence and agility to her fiery interpretation here. Music director Reinhard Goebel provides expert guidance to the period-authentic ensemble Musica Antiqua Koln. I particularly liked the flute solos played with amazing dexterity by Verena Fischer and Dorothea Seel. This is a triumphant recording for the gifted Kozena, who has heretofore had an erratic track record on disc.
