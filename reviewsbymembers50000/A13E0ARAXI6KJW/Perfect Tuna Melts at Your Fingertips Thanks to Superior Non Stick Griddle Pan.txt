 For the single household, I think is a wonderful griddle pan perfect for making French toast, grilled cheese and tuna melt sandwiches, cheese quesadillas and pancakes. The heat from a gas range transfers through the pan quickly and pretty evenly. The non-stick surface is a breeze to clean, and the handle is sturdy. I don't use it for any dish that requires a greater amount of oil or butter because of the low lip, but that's fine by me. At 11 square inches, it's too small to use for parties, but on the other hand, it is easier to carry and store unlike the family-size 20 by 13-inch Grande Griddle. I am amazed how often I use it simply for the convenience. As it is All-Clad, this is a highly recommended piece of cookware to add to your collection.
