 Raconteur Alan Richman, food critic at large for "GQ" magazine, seems to be tapping into his inner David Sedaris in these short accounts of his various experiences with food and dining across the country and around the world. Culled from over a decade of columns in "GQ" and "Bon Appetit", his stories are clever and entertaining, reflecting a wellspring of culinary knowledge and life experiences, which lend a particularly idiosyncratic view to the way he looks at food.  As a fellow "foodie", I can appreciate his curmudgeon view of vegans and their holier-than-thou attitudes toward carnivores. He also includes a vitriolic portrayal of the Hamptons, which he views as a desolate area for quality restaurants where a greater importance is attached to Billy Joel sightings; and an equally acerbic tour of Louis Farrakhan's $5 million Chicago eatery, Salaam, where you can apparently watch pro golf on the TV in the lounge. Other pieces describe a dinner date with Sharon Stone, Richman's elusive fantasy come true; an insistent drive through the Carolinas in search of the perfect barbecue sandwich; the undervalued art of wine spitting; a bemused but ultimately loving view of the archetypal cranky Jewish waiter; and perhaps most amusing, a desperate, Godot-like quest to find a celebrity chef, any celebrity chef, present at his own restaurant. There is even something touching about his recollections of his own tour of duty during the Vietnam War as he sits down for baked squab at a restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City. Sometimes his hardened opinions are at odds with the conversational tone of the book, but his passion for food more than compensates for the acidity. I think the Food Network could use him since no one there (with perhaps the exception of Anthony Bourdain and Alton Brown) shows a fraction of the wit Richman displays here. This is entertaining reading for food aficionados.
