 Having enjoyed his solo debut recording, "Italian Opera Arias", from last year, I looked forward to tenor Rolando Villazn's new disc despite overzealous publicists who have already dubbed him the Fourth Tenor. He is still not there yet, but I am happy to report the new recording exceeds my expectations with a carefully chosen program of song sets from Gounod and Massenet. Reflecting immaculate taste and superb arrangements, Villazn's smooth, slightly dark voice wraps itself around a French repertoire that includes pieces both familiar and somewhat obscure. Produced by the estimable Daniel Zalay (who did similar duties with countertenor David Daniels' exquisite "Berlioz: Les Nuits d't" last year), the program is intelligently broken down into five song sets alternating between the two composers. The result is quite enthralling.  He has a strong vocal technique that doesn't seem as contrived as some of his tenor-voiced brethren, and there is particular evidence of this on Gounod's "La Reine de Saba" ("Faiblesse de la race humaine!...Inspirez-moi, race divine"), where he achieves a noble grandeur without much strain even with the incredible high-C he sings at the end. He does some wondrous work with phrasing that form dramatic scenes with punch and depth, probably the best example being Massenet's "Enfin, Manon...En Fermant Les Yeux", in which he does an effectively lovestruck call-and-response with the soubrettish soprano Natalie Dessay. There are some familiar gems from Gounod's "Romo et Juliette" and "Faust", as well as some stunning pieces I never heard before like Massenet's "Le Roi de Lahore" and "Werther".  Conducted by Evelino Pid, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France performs with dramatic precision making for a supple complement to Villazn's powerful voice. It's a triumphant sophomore effort, better than the somewhat more predictable program of the first CD. Strongly recommended as a showcase for a talent definitely worth watching.
