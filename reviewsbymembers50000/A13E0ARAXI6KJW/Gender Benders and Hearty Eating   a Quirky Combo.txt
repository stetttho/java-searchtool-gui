 I have to admit that I thought the concept behind this restaurant - lip-syncing gender illusionists strutting on top of a bar serving as their runway - was on the cheesy side, clearly designed to attract tourists too afraid to go into a Castro bar. But it's all done in such a harmless manner that it's hard to resist. It is not the most ideal of places, and if you are a party of three like we were on a particularly crowded night, you are squeezed onto the bar regardless of whether or not you have a reservation. I have been here twice before, both times with work colleagues, and remember thinking each time that it was rather pricey given the bar atmosphere and also a hefty cover charge for the entertainment.  Since my last visit over two years ago, the restaurant has responded by providing a fixed price menu, $30 per person for an appetizer, main dish and dessert or after dinner drink. When you multiple the dishes by three, you have quite a feast, and the food is surprisingly good given the restaurant's priorities.  For the appetizers, we ordered a particularly succulent chicken satay, a concoction called an "Asia-dilla", a transplanted quesadilla filled with smoked duck breast, jack cheese and scallions; and the best of the trio, hearty crabcakes with a green papaya salad. For the entrees (though everything is served on small plates making them indistinguishable from the appetizers), we shared tender filet mignon slices served with finger potatoes cut into star shapes (for no apparent reason); lamb medallions with a not-too-overpowering orange sauce; and a quartered ahi tuna burger. They also do a fine job on their standard selection of desserts: a flourless chocolate cake and their showpiece, the banana beignet split for two. Believe me, you will be more than stuffed as you watch the "girls" perform at 15-minute intervals, three in a row in an appropriately tongue-in-cheek manner in some revealing get-ups. In some though not all cases, the show becomes a is-he-or-isn't-he episode of "The Crying Game". It does get noisy, as the bar is the centerpiece and the surrounding tables are generally filled with groups of rowdy, camera-toting tourists. But give it a try as you may be pleasantly surprised by the experience...at least the culinary experience.  FOOD ***1/2 AMBIENCE **1/2 SERVICE *** ENTERTAINMENT ***1/2 OVERALL ***
