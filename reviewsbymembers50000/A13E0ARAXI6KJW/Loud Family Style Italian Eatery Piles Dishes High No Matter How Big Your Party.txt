 OK, I have to admit I came here only because my good friend had a $10 coupon. I doubt if I have been there in over a decade, as Buca di Beppo is one of those places where what you see is pretty much what you get. Once you get there, there's usually a crowd of waiting diners, a mix of office locals, far-flung tourists and Moscone Center convention attendees. That's because the location is convenient, near the Sony Metreon and Yerba Buena Gardens, right on Howard between 4th and 5th. The wait service is friendly but a bit pushy, which is understandable since they seem to have a lot of food to unload. Do yourself a favor and don't ever come alone....this is the epitome of the family-style Italian restaurant.  Prices for all dishes seem very high at first glance. Offering small and large portions, the dishes turn out to be monuments to gluttony. We ordered a "small" Macaroni Rosa (which contains a mix of chicken, broccoli, mushrooms and peas in a tomato-based cream sauce) and found we had enough for four people.  Intriguingly, we also ordered a "small" side dish of Roasted Vegetables to offset the high carb content of the pasta, and to our pleasant surprise, it was indeed a human-size portion complete with kitchen tongs that look like they should have been left on the prep table. None of the food was outstanding or unusual, but it was decent, hearty fare that we lived with uncomfortably in our stomachs for the rest of the night. Needless to say, I can't comment on desserts since we didn't have the slightest desire to eat any more.  By the way, the place is extremely noisy considering that it is not a cavernous place but more of a large basement set-up. There was a work-related party of at least twenty seated near us, and unfortunately I know more about their workplace than my own. However, to be fair, I think this is the ideal place for large gatherings where conversation and food quality are secondary to just showing up. The decor reflects pure Italian-American kitsch circa 1955. Street parking in this area of SOMA is generally easier than most parts of the city but ongoing construction in the area (as of November 2005) has made it more challenging.
