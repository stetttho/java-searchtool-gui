 When Dolly Parton took the stage at the Academy Awards this past week to sing her song from "Transamerica", "Travelin' Thru", her effervescent vocalizing and natural buoyancy (pardon the pun) reminded me of what a great performer she truly is. For someone who has not really embraced country music, I have come over the years to appreciate the honesty, giggly sense of humor and abundant singing talent behind the glamorous trappings of her outsized persona. With 1999's "The Grass Is Blue", I have come to respect her as a true artist who has found a musical genre perfectly suited to her bird-like voice.  Supported by a superb ensemble of bluegrass musicians, she takes on songs as diverse as Billy Joel's "Travelin' Prayer" and traditionals like "Silver Dagger", my personal favorite thanks to Sam Bush's amazing mandolin playing and Jerry Douglas's equally impressive performance on the Dobro. Other standout tracks include the Louvin Brothers' comically sly "Cash on the Barrelhead", Shorty Medlocke's driving "Train, Train"; and Johnny Cash's plaintive "I Still Miss Someone". The disc ends with the powerfully churchy "I Am Ready", an a capella hymn-like song written by her sister Rachel Dennison. Even if you are not a fan of this type of music, the recording is done with such professional precision and style that it's pretty hard to resist.
