 A soft drink does seem like a trivial item to review especially since the general category of food and beverages depends more on one's own palette. A friend of mine introduced me to this drink based on his own childhood remembrance in the Midwest. I don't recall it from mine, but once I tasted it, it did take me back to the days when miniature plastic bottles of Hawaiian Fruit Punch stood next to my mother's jell-o mold in the refrigerator.   With the appropriate color-clashing, tropical dcor on the can, Tahitian Treat is tasty in that fizzy, retro sort of way and is definitely not for the macrobiotic among us, as there are standard, life-shortening ingredients like sodium benzoate and Red #40 pervading the carbonation. And you certainly can't drink it like Diet Coke since it is an astonishing 200 calories a can. But baby boomers should have a stash when they feel like a walk down a sugar-infested memory lane. Be forewarned that Amazon may be the only option to get this soft drink since it is not easily found at stores as specialized as Beverages and More, at least here in Northern California.
