 What a hidden gem this recording is. This disc ends with a rousing version of  "Rule Britannia" (called here by its official title "When Britain first at heav'n's command"), the unofficial British anthem and familiar to anyone who has watched a movie or TV show where the scene all of a sudden changes to a shot of Big Ben. The performance inspires with blazing trumpets, dramatic strings and proud chorus.  But the real pleasures of this recording come well before with a wide variety of tones and moods.  It certainly helps to have such a stellar cast performing superlatively - sopranos Jennifer Smith and Christine Brandes, tenor Jamie MacDougall, countertenor David Daniels and the San Francisco-based Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra and Chorale, all under the direction of conductor Nicholas McGegan.  With equal amounts of gusto and pastoral, the entire work sounds like it was composed by Handel but was in fact written by Thomas Arne, whose libretto is a fanciful, patriotic tale about King Alfred searching for his wife and son while fighting the Danes.  If there is a standout in this distinguished cast, it is Daniels, who sings five solo arias as Alfred's son, Prince Edward. The touching "Why beats my heart with such devotion" is especially wonderful, though "Vengeance, O come inspire me" is a real soul-stirrer. Also excellent is the trio performance on "Let not those who love complain" with Smith, Daniels and MacDougall, especially as they match their coloraturas seamlessly.  It will raise goose pimples, and so will "Rule Britannia" even if you are not an Anglophile.  This disc is definitely worth seeking out.
