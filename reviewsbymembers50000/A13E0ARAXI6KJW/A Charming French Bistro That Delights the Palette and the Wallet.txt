 It's easy to bypass by Le Charm Bistro on 5th Street a bit south of Folsom. There is no overly quaint awning, no caf-style tables for two, no starchy waiter with a small bow tie and towel hanging over his right arm. However, once you do enter, it's a charming place with breezy, friendly service and when available, a nice patio in the back. Most importantly, with the $28 three-course Prix Fixe menu , I also think this restaurant delivers one of the best deals for a fine French meal.  Since it's only a ten-minute walk from my home, I have been there a number of times and have never been disappointed. Among the main courses, I particularly like the Grilled Bavette Steak with Shallots and Pommes Frites, as well as the Duck Confit with Pomme Landaise and Bacon (which is also generally available as an appetizer salad).  For something more Gallic, I suggest one of two hearty appetizers - the savory Fricasse Escargots with Wild Mushrooms or the Crisp Pastry of Braised Oxtail and Pigs Feet. If you have a more traditional palette, there is a wonderfully filling French Onion Soup and a very nice Glazed Figs with Arugula Salad and Roquefort Cheese and Walnuts. Desserts are excellent as well, with the standouts being Apple Tarte Tatin and Floating Island with Crme Anglaise. There is a solid though not extensive wine selection, the expected mix of French and local labels. Because of my proximity, I've never had to deal with parking, but street parking in this area of SOMA (close to Moscone Center and the Metreon) can be a bit more difficult in the evening as it's very close to competitive restaurants like Azie and Lulu's. It's only a little more than three lights from Market Street, so it's an easy walk from the main artery of public transportation.  FOOD ****1/2 AMBIENCE **** SERVICE ****1/2 OVERALL ****1/2
