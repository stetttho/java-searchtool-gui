 Recorded in 2001 and released the following year, this is a lovely, clean recording of Vivaldi's three most famous sacred works for choral ensembles. The Cambridge's Choir of King's College, alongside the Academy of Ancient Music led by Stephen Cleobury, moves through each vital movement with appropriate fluidity and passion. With its familiar grandiose opening, the "Gloria" makes a strong impression here simply because the choir and orchestra perform it with enthusiasm and energy capturing the life-affirming spirit of the piece. Countertenor Michael Chance is a particular standout on his two mellifluous solos, "Domine Deus, Agnus Dei" and "Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris" with affecting dramatic shading. The "Dixit Dominus" is equally enthralling with particular harmonic splendor provided by sopranos Sarah Fox and Deborah Norman on "Virgam Virtutis tuae" and tenor James Gilchrist and bass-baritone Jonathan Lemalu on "Dominus a dextris tuis".  The last vocal work here is the latest of several adaptations Vivaldi made of the "Magnificat" which he had originally written for the Piet, probably during the early 18th century. The arias are sung with expressive character with the best movements provided by Fox and Norman in their assured approach on the cadenza in their "Esurientes" and a brief trio by Norman, Chance and Lemalu on "Sicut locutus est". The singing of the five soloists couldn't be more accomplished, but it's the spirited grandeur of the choir that most pervasively captures Vivaldi's irrepressible spirit. This recording is one to treasure as the vocal and instrumental ensembles meld perfectly. If Vivaldi's religious music brings you enjoyment, I also recommend Fabio Biondi's 2004 release, "Vivaldi: Motets", which features stunning vocal work from soprano Patrizia Ciofi and his 2002 collaboration with equally stellar work from countertenor David Daniels on "Vivaldi: Stabat Mater, Nisi Dominus, Longe Mala". All three recordings are strongly recommended.
