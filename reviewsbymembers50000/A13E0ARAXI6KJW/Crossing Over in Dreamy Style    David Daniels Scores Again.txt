 When I realized Liza Minnelli and Barbra Streisand covered the first two songs on this CD, I had to admit I was a bit worried that "A Quiet Thing" would be one of those crossover albums that famous opera singers need to do to please their management companies. But leave it to countertenor David Daniels to continue venturing into new territory for his rarefied voice type. Although Baroque-loving traditionalists may balk at his choice of repertoire this time, he paints a broad musical canvas along with guitarist Craig Ogden, encompassing American folk, English and Spanish renaissance, Italian bel canto, two versions of "Ave Maria", and even some Tin Pan Alley. This could have been an unwieldy smorgasbord for a lesser singer, but never underestimate Daniels' vocal dexterity, incredible coloratura and superb taste. Daniels and Ogden have really turned this program into a cohesive vision full of simply beautiful music wonderfully realized through voice and guitar - probably the best such coupling I have heard since Kathleen Battle and Christopher Parkening's "Pleasures of Their Company" more than a decade ago.    Standout tracks include Alec Wilder's melancholy "Blackberry Winter", a contemporary piece which ranks right up there with any of Daniels' much-revered Handel arias; John Dowland's "Come Again, Sweet Love", so familiar yet perfect for his voice; the one-two Americana sequence of "Beautiful Dreamer" and "Shenandoah"; and the title track by John Kander, which he sings with a languid quality that adds dimension to its original meaning. Such flights of vocal beauty make one wonder when he will tackle the Sondheim songbook. This is a terrific album, ideal for those who want an introduction to not only the countertenor voice but also the artistry of David Daniels.
