 I never read Scott Heim's source novel, but regardless, I am genuinely bewildered by the praise heaped upon director-screenwriter Gregg Araki's amateurish 2005 feature about child abuse and recovered memory. Granted the overriding themes are valid and worthy of exploration, I just find Araki's approach exploitative and relentless. The plot revolves around two eight year-old boys traumatized by incidents that affected them in completely different ways. Brian is a geek who thinks he was abducted by aliens, while surly Neil has become a male prostitute in a futile attempt to recapture the intimacy he felt with his Little League coach. That the boys' parallel stories converge over the next decade becomes pretty obvious when Brian's journey takes on increasingly contrived dimensions, especially as he connects with Avalyn, an obsessive farm girl who claims to have had a similar alien encounter. However, it's Neil's journey that Araki chooses to present in disturbing detail with one scene of sexual degradation after another ending with an act of violent sodomy in a bathtub.  Obviously distancing himself from his "Third Rock from the Sun" character to develop some indie cred, Joseph Gordon-Levitt portrays Neil with passive hostility in a hollow attempt to look cool. Brady Corbet certainly captures the awkwardness of Brian, but his unchanging naivet gets tiresome. Only in the final minutes does either actor achieve a sense of poignancy. I was amazed and somewhat saddened to see Elisabeth Shue in the role of Neil's blowsy mother, though her role is gratefully brief. Michelle Trachtenberg and Jeff Licon actually manage to elicit some sympathy for their oddball characters, though Mary Lynn Rajskub takes the cake for her portrayal of Avalyn. Other roles are acted atrociously like a snuff film, which may have been Araki's intent. It's obvious that he is trying to compensate for a weakly developed storytelling technique with scenes that are designed to provoke and shock. I have to admit that when the plot strands come together at the end, the movie improves considerably. But by that point, it is too late as I became far more numbed than moved by the conclusion.
