 Although it is no masterpiece, I like Zach Braff's directorial debut, "Garden State", a quirky, mostly delightful film about loss and self-discovery for a New Jersey-raised Hollywood actor/waiter who has come home to face his demons. Fortunately the accompanying soundtrack faithfully captures the spirit of Braff's movie and not in as commercially predictable a way as one would think given current Hollywood tie-in thinking. Apparently he compiled all of the tracks for the film himself, and his personal touch and good taste make for a topnotch program that emits a mellow vibe that insinuates itself throughout the music. What's more, viewing of the movie is not necessary to enjoy this soundtrack. It definitely stands on its own.  There are several gems to this collection like Coldplay's opening "Don't Panic",  which sounds very much like a lost Dire Straits track; the two superb tracks by the Shins (praised exorbitantly by Natalie Portman's character in the movie), "Caring Is Creepy" and "New Slang"; and my personal favorites, Zero 7's "In the Waiting Line" and Frou Frou's "Let Go", the latter with an intoxicating soft techno-beat that frankly sounds better than any single I have heard from sound-alike Dido. Even old chestnuts like Simon and Garfunkel's "The Only Living Boy in New York" get new life in the context of this thoughtful compilation. Highly recommended.
