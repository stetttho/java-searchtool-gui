 Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain has that cock-of-the-walk, been-there-done-that personality that people either like or loathe. This travel/food short story collection - 22 in all - will unlikely change anyone's opinions, but on its own, it provides a fascinating glimpse into a variety of cultures and the attitudes of natives to their food. It also makes the ideal companion to the series he did for the Food Network. The concept is simple: he travels the world searching for the perfect meal and discovers more to the countries than just the food. Each chapter is devoted to a particular country or trip.   When he sticks to his topic, the book is a fun, interesting read, for example, when he talks about Japan, he recognizes that much of their food preparation reflects the cultural obsession with quality. He manages to get us into a family home in St. Petersburg and captures the spirit within the darkness of that country. In Mexico, he paints a vivid tableau of a small town feast and how their sense of community informs all their cooking.  My favorite chapter is on Vietnam where he shows a real intimacy with the people there and a certain audacity in trying soft-boiled duck embryos and live cobra hearts. Having taken cooking lessons in a number of the countries he visited, I can appreciate his sense of wonder and surprise when he tries something most of the rest of us wouldn't dare touch. Bourdain is most successful when he positions himself as a curious traveler but less so when he feels a need to exhibit how cool he is, offering self-congratulatory quips rather than real insights. Regardless, whether it's deep-fried Mars bars in Glasgow, roasted lamb testicles in Morocco, or a four-star meal at Thomas Keller's French Laundry restaurant in Yountville, California, this book offers Bourdain's adventurous palette in easy, bite-size pieces.
