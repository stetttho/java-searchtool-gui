 Michael Tilson Thomas leads the San Francisco Symphony in a stirring recording of Mahler's powerful Resurrection Symphony #2. The playing is nothing short of masterful, as it reflects depth, precision and beauty, and the musical line is well sustained in the lengthier sections. The second movement is especially fine, but the highlight is most definitely the finale, as uniformly splendid as one could possibly want of this piece. The big percussion crescendos and the ensuing marches achieve amazing dramatic heights, and the choir sounds absolutely inspiring. Thomas does a nice job of adjusting the tempo movements, especially during the final reprise of the resurrection chorus, while he brings in a combination of bells, organ, and tam-tam with thundering effect.  Soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian and especially mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson deliver exquisite vocal performances. Gifted with her perfectly natural and persuasive sound, Lieberson's rich singing of the "Urlicht" movement is particularly breathtaking. The entire recording registers with excellent clarity and atmosphere. As definitive a recording as you can expect of this piece thanks to Thomas' masterful direction.
