 The time may be ripe to allow us to review 9/11 with greater scrutiny given the escalating threat of terrorism facing this country in the over four years that have elapsed since that tragedy. Author David Ray Griffin, a process theologian from the Claremont School of Theology, takes a controversial though not groundbreaking stand with this well-written and documented book, that the Bush administration was fully aware of the attacks and allowed them to happen in order to push their political agenda for greater imperialism in the Middle East. One would think that "The 9/11 Commission Report" would be the definitive word on the events of that day, but Griffin delves into the possibilities of how such a tragedy could have been manipulated and for what purpose. Though I could not imagine, before reading this book, that they could have actually known what was being planned and allowed the events to unfold deliberately, the fact remains that the Bush administration has profited greatly from the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  The author writes in precisely and without fiery rhetoric but gets to his points directly in arguing the high probability for the Bush Administration's complicity in allowing and facilitating the attacks. He does not base his observations on any one conclusive piece of evidence, but the sheer accumulation of all of the data, in particular, Paul Thompson's "The Terror Timeline". Griffin starts with the improbability of commercial jets crashing into secure, high-occupancy buildings. Among the four planes, standard procedures were not followed for intervention meaning there was no call for fighter jets to intervene. It seems particularly egregious in this case since there was time for interception in both cases. In fact, flight #93 was the only plane shot down although only after it appeared passengers were on the verge of taking control.  This is all compelling evidence, though I wish Griffin could have examined the possibility of Israeli participation or the Mossad in the attacks. There were apparently Israelis shadowing the 9/11 hijackers. I would have liked a stronger connection established with the epidemic of anthrax letters at the time, as well as a more thorough analysis of Thierry Meyssan's "The Big Lie" which asserts that the terrorist attacks were hatched here in the US and that it signals the end of democracy as we know it. One intriguing revelation is the U.S. Space Command, in which Donald Rumsfeld was chairman of the commission to assess U.S. national security space management and organization. In a report that preceded the attacks by several months, it recommends the subordination of all the other armed forces and the intelligence agencies to an omnipotent space force and that it will take another Pearl Harbor-type event to reinforce this need (thus the book's title).  The author concludes by calling for a third-party investigative effort to re-examine the evidence that the 9/11 Commission reviewed within the context of the new evidence he presents in the book. He concludes the book with some considerable evidence of the way the Bush Administration has obstructed any independent investigation of 9/11 since it occurred, both withholding key documents and insisting that the official investigation limit itself to recommendations about how to avoid such an event in the future, which corroborates Senator Bill Graham's account in his penetrating book, "Intelligence Matters". Griffin has shed an unyielding light on some of the wherefores for 9/11, and he allows us to connect the dots.
