 French soprano Sandrine Piau is not as readily known as other Handelians, at least on this side of the pond, but she is certainly among the most gifted of interpreters as she proves on this wonderful recording of opera arias specifically written for the soprano voice. Even though mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt-Lieberson and soprano Rene Fleming have put out superb, higher profile recordings of Handel arias in the past few months, you can still confidently add this one to your collection thanks to Piau's thrilling, expressive vocalism, at once early-music in style with a powerful yet economical use of technique, well-balanced with a wide capacity for accurate coloratura and an immaculate technique sure to please Baroque purists.  Piau displays impeccable taste in her highly personalized program. Instead of going for the more familiar gems like "Ombra mai f" from "Serse", she has pulled together an anthology of Handelian prime donne that features arias composed over more than two decades.  Many are from operas that are relatively obscure but still quite stunning, for example, the defiant "Scoglio d'immota fronte" from "Scipione", the dynamic "Brilla nell' alma un non inteso ancor" from "Alessandro" and the angry, distressed "M'ai resa infelice" from "Deidamia". Even with the better known operas, she choose not the showpieces but the ones that are worthy of rediscovery, such as "Verdi piante, erbette liete" from "Orlando", "Se pieta" from "Giulio Cesare in Egritto", "L'amor ed il destin" from "Partenope" and "Ombre piante, une funeste" from "Rodelinda", in which her painful expressiveness of want certainly gives Fleming a run for her money. Even the order of the program is commendable, as it reflects a wide gamut of emotions that make the recording feel like one cohesive work, even with the variety of characters and dramatic situations and rich vocal demands for which Handel is known. Piau's long-time collaboration with Christophe Rousset, who leads the wondrous and period-authentic playing of Les Talens Lyriques, has produced a seamless rapport that makes this an essential recording. Strongly recommended.
