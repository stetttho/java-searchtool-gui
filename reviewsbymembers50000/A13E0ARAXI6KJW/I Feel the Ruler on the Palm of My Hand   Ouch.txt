 I was raised by ruler-swinging, grammar-obsessed schoolteachers on Strunk and White's "Elements of Style", and at first glance, its 105 well-organized pages seem like a bargain compared to Lynne Truss' (or Truss's, excuse me) twice-as-long book on punctuation. Passionate and unflagging about her topic, the author does have a tendency to pontificate, but at least she is clever about her understandably anal-retentive nature if somewhat uncompromising (as she does warn with her subheading, "The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation"). This book has to be the oddest mainstay on the bestseller lists since Francesca Johnson swooned over Robert Kincaid in the disguised Harlequin romance, "The Bridges of Madison County". But at least Truss's book provides value in the little takeaways that will make readers appear more literate in their next e-mail correspondence.  This is my backhanded way of saying that this is a delightful little book. I really enjoyed how she delved into the historical roots of many of the punctuation standards (in particular, abused commas, foreboding semicolons and mysterious hyphens) we take for granted today. But for me, what was particularly interesting was her take on the Internet and how it has introduced yet another form of lexicon with "emoticons". She disapproves of their use, of course, assuming people should be able to use words to express their emotions, yet there is no getting around the fact that they are a convenient shorthand in a real-time medium that demands responses yesterday ;-).  I think if Truss were more tolerant of these Web-based changes, I could more enthusiastically endorse this book. As it stands, it remains a charming book by someone who loves her subject and makes no apology for being stubborn about how we should all punctuate.
