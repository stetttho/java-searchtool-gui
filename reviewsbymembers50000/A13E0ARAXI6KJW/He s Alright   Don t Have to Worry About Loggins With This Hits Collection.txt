 Ah...this one takes me back.  Singer/songwriter Kenny Loggins epitomized the mellow Southern California pop/rock of the 1970's and 80's. Baby boomers like me look at this period of music with nostalgia and can forgive the sometimes unctuous vocal delivery he displayed. Less rhythmically oriented than his peer Michael McDonald, Loggins veered toward punctuated hooks and big ballads. This greatest hits collection represents his predilections pretty accurately, and the sound is quite clean. There are several movie soundtrack songs included here - the beer-chugging "I'm Alright" from "Caddyshack", the synth-saturated "Danger Zone" from "Top Gun"; the touchy-mopey "Meet Me Half Way" from the Sly Stallone arm-wrestling flick, "Over the Top"; and of course, the inescapably snappy "Footloose". There are also a couple of duets - the rocker-wannabe "Don't Fight It" with Journey's Steve Perry and the Mac-and-cheese classic, "Whenever I Call You Friend" with Stevie Nicks.  However, the best tracks are the two he wrote with McDonald, both reflecting the Doobie-inflected beats that were damnably catchy - his do-or-die anthem, "This Is It", and my personal favorite, "Heart to Heart", with its swooning cadences and a beautiful string accompaniment that turns the song into a true guilty pleasure. There are also more recent tracks - the treacle-laden "For the First Time" and the pop-jazzy "The Rest of Your Life" - which show how he has moved seamlessly to the adult contemporary genre. Understand that a lot of these songs were AM-radio staples when they were climbing the charts back then, so listening to them a quarter-century later is like a time-capsule of the Reagan years. This is good listening for fans, though the unconverted will likely remain unmoved.
