 I have to admit I was disappointed with Yo-Yo Ma's last album, "Obrigado Brazil", which uneasily and unwisely mixes his unparalleled cello playing with a wide panorama of somewhat incompatible Brazilian music. Fortunately, this time around, his vast musical curiosity pays off with this beautiful recording, a splendid tribute to the film music of composer Ennio Morricone. Produced by the composer himself, the disc has a langourous, often romantic quality that immediately evokes the films they represent. I heard it as I was browsing at my local Virgin Megastore and immediately knew I wanted to own it.  The most impressive aspect of this album is that it's not a simple replay of the scores but an actual reworking of these familiar themes into new symphonic arrangements which sound as if they were composed specifically for an orchestra featuring a cello soloist. The album offers eight tracks, which combine music from different films by the same director (e.g., Sergio Leone, Brian de Palma) into a series of suites, as well as providing shorter arrangements of individual themes. Most of Morricone's most popular melodies are here, in particular, pieces from "The Mission", "Cinema Paradiso" (almost too briefly represented here) and the main theme from "Malena". It's all quite superb as the recording melds together in a dream-like way. Accompanied ably by the Roma Sinfonietta Orchestra, Ma is in top form throughout, subtly capturing all the rich emotions in each piece. Granted the music does have a certain monotony of tone that makes it ideal for playing in the background, this is nonetheless a virtuoso performance by all concerned. Strongly recommended to anyone who loves film scores rich in aural beauty and visual recollection.
