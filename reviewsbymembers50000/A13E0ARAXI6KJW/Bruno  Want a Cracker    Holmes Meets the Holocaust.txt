 I really enjoyed Michael Chabon's mix of comic books and pulp fiction in his epic novel, "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay", so it was a surprise to find this to be such a compact read - only 131 pages - even though the subject is arguably more ambitious. The plot focuses on an 89-year old Sherlock Holmes, long retired and perfectly content looking after his bees, who is called back to action by an odd murder case involving a rare and oddly eloquent parrot named Bruno and a 9-year old mute German Jewish refugee named Linus. Holmes and Linus inevitably start out with a prickly relationship, but they begin to nurture each other in the midst of the changing yet steadfastly prejudiced society that was Britain before the end of World War II.  Inspired by the atmospheric Arthur Conan Doyle mysteries, Chabon has written a very English mystery that hinges on a numerical puzzle. The parrot can sing German lieder but more pertinently, repeat complex lists of numbers. His talent attracts British intelligence agents and perhaps German ones as well, and the consequence of the war comes to the fore. This is too convoluted for the clueless police but not for Holmes even in his frail and enfeebled state. There is plenty of wonderful writing here, and Chabon keeps the narrative tight, almost too cryptic at times. The conclusion is inevitable and frankly not all that surprising, which undermines the point of resuscitating Holmes for what is presumably his final case. An intriguing novella ideal for a few commuter train rides, though I think Chabon could have lent a bit more of the color and texture that made Kavalier and Clay so memorable.
