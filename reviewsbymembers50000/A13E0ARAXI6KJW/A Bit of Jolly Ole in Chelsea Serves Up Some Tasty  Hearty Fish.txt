 I have to admit I sought this place out in Chelsea after seeing Rachael Ray rave about it on her Tasty Travels series on the Food Network. Located in the heart of Chelsea on Greenwich Street between 12th and 13th Street, it's a very compact place with just two small counters and an outdoor bench for eating. Blink and you will indeed miss it since it is simply a storefront next to a louder-looking burrito place. However, it appears to be an authentic fish-and-chips place down to the Brit-accented order taker and cook and a selection of pub beers and sodas. Since fish and chips have been somewhat ruined for me by fast food chains who have tried to expand their fried chicken menus, I am pleased to report that the owners are trying to keep true to their concept.  They just opened a bigger second place, so I assume the demand for such fare is high in Manhattan. I can see why, as the servings are more than generous. I had the cod and shrimp combo with chips ($12.49), while my friend had the full cod ($6.99 without chips). The fish was delicious and fresh-tasting, especially the jumbo shrimp, and the batter was crispy but not overly heavy. The one drawback was the potatoes were a bit on the lukewarm side as if they had been in the warmer a bit too long. To be fair, we went at about 4PM to avoid the crowds, though I imagine most people must take-out given the tiny location. Definitely give it a try if you have a hankering for tasty fish and chips. They mention deep-fried Mars Bars and cream eggs, but I did not dare go there.  FOOD ****1/2 AMBIENCE *** SERVICE ***  OVERALL ****
