 In anticipation of the new film, the previews of which cast an intoxicating spell beyond its obvious travelogue aspects, I wanted to read the original source, Che Guevara's diary of the cross-continental journey he took with his best friend Alberto Granado. What I found is a book whose voice is purely that of a young man looking for his place in the world. There are many books of this ilk around, but obviously what makes this one resonate is Guevara's history after the end of this diary - doctor, Marxist revolutionary alongside the more politic Castro, Cuba's minister of industry, martyr for the Communist cause shot by a firing squad in Bolivia, photogenic icon emblazoned on T-shirts and college dorm posters.  It's a slim volume, mostly observational as would be reasonable to expect from a 24-year old. By no means is the book deeply introspective, as an older man would probably write in nostalgic hindsight. The young Che describes his and Granado's race around South America on a Norton motorbike, and true to someone whose world was ahead of him, he makes broad generalizations about everything he sees - the sight of a stag running as a symbol of the calm before the storm, the political unrest in Chile, the police state he felt Peru was becoming. As road trip stories go, this is decent if rather callow. But what saves the book from being purely youthful treacle is the increasingly darker tone the book takes foreshadowing his development into a revolutionary. Granted it ends far too short of his true achievements to be meaningful as biography, it helps to keep in mind where his life was about to lead. This new edition also has a nice expanded foreword by his daughter Aleida and lots of previously unpublished photos taken by Guevara and Granado on their journey. Definitely worth seeking out if you want to understand the beginning of Che's myth but not if you want political biography.
