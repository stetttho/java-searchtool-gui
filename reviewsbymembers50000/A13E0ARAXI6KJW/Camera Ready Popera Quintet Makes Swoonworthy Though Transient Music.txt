 I am always wary of these types of crossover efforts because in their valid attempt to bring a broader audience to opera, they make compromises to the music itself. What barely saves this overblown production are the five talented voices presented here - New Zealand tenor Geoff Sewell, South African soprano Tsakane Valentine, and from England, soprano Jo Appleby, tenor David Habbin and bass-baritone Nick Garrett. The photogenic quintet (who bill themselves without irony as "the first opera band") all attain a beautiful tonal quality, but a sameness creeps into the program because there is little room for dramatic interpretation in Nick Patrick's swooning production. Although all five are purported to be classically trained, their cumulative experience in actual opera performances is pretty light, and to be honest, it shows in the lack of texture in their singing.  That is not to say the recording is without its charms. There are three tracks that are quite nice and relatively accomplished - "Mon coeur s'ouvre a ta voix" from Saint-Sans' "Samson and Delilah" led by Appleby's and Valentine's intertwining vocals, "Recondita armonia" from Puccini's "Tosca" and "Land & Freedom (Terra a Liberta)" based on Beethoven's famously passionate Allegretto from his Seventh Symphony. The rest of the program is somewhat more on the derivative side, and a few I'm afraid are pure dreck, for example, "The Prayer", which was originally a duet by two people who are no stranger to dreck, Andrea Bocelli and Celine Dion. I can understand why this quintet has their audience in thrall, and if their efforts are making opera more accessible to the masses, more power to them. I have to admit I prefer my opera arias in a more traditional setting.
