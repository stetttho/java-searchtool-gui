 There's something classically mythic about baseball, and probably no team has been mythologized as much as the Brooklyn Dodgers, a team that reached its pinnacle with its only World Series win in 1955 and its ebb when the franchise moved to Los Angeles two years later. Longtime Boston Globe reporter Thomas Oliphant has written a nostalgic memoir along the lines of one of David Halberstam's baseball remembrances, "Summer of `49" about the Yankees. He focuses on the defining seventh game of the 1955 World Series with meticulous conviction and of course, his favorite player, Gil Hodges, for good reason. Originally signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as a third baseman, Hodges held the National League record for grand slams for several years (14), and he is a member of the exclusive club of players that have hit four home runs in a single game. With 1,001, he also had more RBIs during the 1950's than any other player, and he was an eight-time All-Star. Statistics like these are trivial to many but pure gold to any true fan.  Consequently there is no more fitting legend than Hodges for Oliphant to praise with such worshipful awe. At the same time, the author touches upon the issue of race, as baseball was still in the throes of Jackie Robinson's breakthrough, and describes how much the Dodgers meant to their African-American fans. The book is a great read for anyone who wants to understand the degree of passion behind the "Boys of Summer" at Ebbets Field, as Oliphant traces his childhood within the context of the team's winning season. He goes into vivid detail about the borough and its inhabitants and why the team became so important to them even when owner Walter O'Malley left Kings County for the greener pastures of LA. Oliphant makes the book resonate by personalizing the role of baseball in the American fabric without getting didactic with obscure statistics. This is ideal summer reading even for those with a passing interest in the game.
