 Many of us baby boomers have lived and breathed William Strunk Jr.'s and E.B. White's "Elements of Style" as we attempted to reacquaint ourselves with the rules of the road when it comes to writing clear prose. Its compact size (only 105 pages) and clear organization made the tome the pinnacle of usability before such factors came into play as successful criteria for any easy-to-use reference manual. The book, at least White's famous revision of it, is as old as me, both of us born in 1959, and clearly both of us are in need of an overhaul to refresh the knowledge we present to a more contemporary audience.  Enter artist Maira Kalman, who was so inspired by the book when she discovered it at a yard sale four years ago that she applied her considerable artistic gift and contributed 59 colorful illustrations to this version. The net result is a charming and comical addendum to an established classic. Keep in mind that the original intention of the authors was simply to present eight elementary rules of usage, ten elementary principles of composition and a list of commonly misused words or expressions. Consequently, it's impressive how Kalman is able to stay true to the rigidity of the book's structure with her whimsical images. Even though in earlier days I actually preferred the slap of the ruler of White's terse instructional style, I think Kalman brings a sense of humanity that is totally unexpected.
