 Ten world-class singers have been assembled for this 2002 anthology of Handel's chamber duets, nine in all. The selections are sometimes in two movements but more often in three contrasted movements with various changes in tempo, as they tell sometimes disheartening, sometimes effusive tales of the effects of love. They all have the familiar pastoral feel that Handel often brings to his compositions, and these, in particular, are inspired by the Arcadian academies and courts of Italy at the end of the 17th century. Led by Emmanuelle Ham, this recording  intelligently uses many distinct voices to lend individuality to each of the selections, in contrast to, say, the recent 2004 Handel duets CD in which soprano Patrizia Ciofi and mezzo-soprano Joyce Di Donato ambitiously tackle an almost overwhelming variety of Italian opera duets just by themselves.  All the women here are excellent. The particular standouts are French sopranos Natalie Dessay and Vronique Gens on the opening duet, "Ahi, nelle sorte umane" with their bright voices intertwined with deep, intense feeling; the lightness of Laura Claycomb's soprano matched with the superb fullness of Sara Mingardo's contralto on "Tanti strali al sen mi scocci" and again on the concluding "Sono liete, fortunate"; and the similarly contrasting performances of soprano Patricia Petibon and contralto Marijana Mijanovic on "A mirarvi io son intento". The two men featured are somewhat disappointing but only by comparison - tenor Paul Agnew sounds a bit unctuous and lead-footed against Petibon's ethereal silvery tones on "Caro autor di mia doglia", and countertenor Brian Asawa, despite a purity in tone, sounds dramatically constrained on "Conservate, raddoppiate", his brief duet with soprano Juanita Lascarro. Regardless, the overall mood of the recording is appropriately sonorous and for the most part, period-authentic except for Ham's organ which is used to sparing dramatic effect. As she has proven with her wondrous direction of an equally stellar cast on the 2003 Virgin Classics recording of Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas", Ham provides intense musical leadership among a varied set of talents with the able accompaniment of her ensemble, Le Concert d'Astre.
