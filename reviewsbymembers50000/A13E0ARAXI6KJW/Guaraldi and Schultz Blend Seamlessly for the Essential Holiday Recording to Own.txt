 I doubt if there has been a better match between sound and image than Vince Guaraldi's jazz lounge compositions and Charles Schultz's Peanuts characters, both instantly memorable nostalgia triggers for any self-respecting baby boomer. Far more than the current spate of holiday CDs released for sure-fire commercial profit by singers who otherwise have no affinity for the music, this disc contains a timeless quality that makes this an indispensable soundtrack to own. With his definitive version of "Cast Your Fate to the Wind", Guaraldi was already an established jazz musician by the time he recorded this album in 1965 with his trio, Monty Budwig on bass and Colin Bailey on drums.  Their relaxed playing belies their ensemble craftsmanship on established holiday classics such as "O Tannenbaum", "What Child Is This" and "The Christmas Song", and Guaraldi lends a particularly nice jazz twist to "The Little Drummer Boy" with "My Little Drum". There are the familiar non-holiday pieces, Schroeder's showpiece, "Fur Elise", as well as "Greensleeves". However, the original compositions shine brightest here - the forlorn "Christmastime is Here", the percolating "Skating" (which conjures up instant images of Snoopy gliding on the ice), "Christmas Is Coming" (where the children are rehearsing willy-nilly in the auditorium), and the Peanuts signature tune, "Linus and Lucy". This is an absolute must to own, holiday season or not.
