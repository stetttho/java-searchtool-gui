 At its West Belmont Avenue location just a few feet from the L train station off the Red Line, Ann Sather's is the type of place that feels like you stepped back in time with the traditional glass-display of the bakery and the dark wood-paneled walls. The cashier and waitresses are obvious veterans of the establishment, who have probably seen it all and are fond of calling everyone "Honey". I was sparked into going back here from two sources - the Access Chicago guide considers it a breakfast must-go, and Rachael Ray recently echoed the sentiment in the Chicago episode of her "$40 a Day" series when she visited the sunnier-looking Andersonville location. By the way, I didn't know there are five locations in the city, but judging from the pictures, I think the Belmont Avenue restaurant feels the most period-authentic.   The menu is amazingly robust for breakfast, lunch or dinner, and in fact, on St. Patrick's Day, the day I went there, a couple of old-timers were having generous slabs of corned beef at 10 in the morning. However, I stuck with tradition, and indeed, their renowned cinnamon buns are likely the best I've ever had, and it's not because of size but due to the hot, tasty glaze dripping over it. Feeling guilty over ingesting it, I ordered the delicious and fluffy vegetable omelet, which looks like it was baked in a small cast iron skillet pan. My only disappointment is the watery coffee, which is probably as true to the period the restaurant evokes as anything else. The service is courteous with the humor and candor you would expect from an episode of "Alice". I went mid-morning on a weekday, but I could well imagine the place gets crowded with long queues awaiting the cinnamon buns. It would still be worth the trouble to have a taste from this Chicago institution.  FOOD ****1/2  AMBIENCE ***1/2  SERVICE ****  OVERALL ****
