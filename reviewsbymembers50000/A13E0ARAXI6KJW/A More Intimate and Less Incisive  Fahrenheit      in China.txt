 This is an enchanting though serious-minded little book that actually has a lot in common with Ray Bradbury's classic "Fahrenheit 451", especially since both stories revolve around a totalitarian society that has sealed itself off from literature and how someone recognizes the oppression and dares to break free from it.  This novella tells the story of two city teenage boys exiled to a remote mountain village for re-education during China's Cultural Revolution of the sixties. There the two friends meet the daughter of the local tailor and discover a hidden treasure trove of classic Western literature in Chinese translation. This proves fortuitous to them as they venture into worlds they never imagined.   What I liked most about this book is how author Dai Sijie conveys the rapture of losing oneself in the words and stories found in these books while the characters lead desperate lives in a dreary setting. Under the author's light narrative touch (which was translated from French), the reader is left with the conviction that the mind and soul matter - that trying to control them by banning books and restricting education is wrong and intolerable. The book offers a good yet intimate picture of China during the Cultural Revolution -- the outrages, the petty humiliations, and the incredible poverty in the Chinese countryside. At the same time, the story moves too quickly given the scope of the theme. The net result is that Sijie does not dig deep enough into his main characters, thus making the lack of closure at the end less than satisfying though inevitable. Regardless of the shortfall in its pacing, this book is a fine little read and highly recommended.
