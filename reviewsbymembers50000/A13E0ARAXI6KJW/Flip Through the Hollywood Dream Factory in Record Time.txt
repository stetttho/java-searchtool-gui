 For a Hollywood film fanatic, this is one delightful photo flip book that will represent a major time suck if you're not careful. Surely there are worse ways to spend your time than poring through the photos of the great and some not-so-great movies that are included here. David Thomson, the renowned film historian who is responsible for the be-all tome on the movies, "The Biographical Dictionary of Film", a volume so onerous that he can only update it every ten years or so. This book is no less ambitious in its scope, yet amazingly compact considering that it covers almost the entire history of Hollywood filmmaking from 1915 to 2001. This time he lets the pictures do most of the talking.  What I like most is the choice of images used here, as they are hand-picked from the legendary Kobal Collection - a combination of film stills (some familiar, some unusual alternate shots), publicity photos, movie posters and my favorites, on-the-set photos that capture both cast and crew at work and sometimes play. One priceless photo has actors in full make-up playing poker on the set of "Planet of the Apes". Adding to the enjoyment are Thomson's pithy yet often perceptive captions on the impact of the stars and films highlighted. He organizes the book into the separate decades and provides a small introduction for each section, but it is the comprehensive photo collection that garners the most attention here. Now in a much smaller, more reasonably priced, almost square-shaped form, the paperback version is fun to share and use to reminisce with friends on everyone's favorite films. The only downside is that the print gets miniscule at this size. A treat that should be a mainstay on your coffee table.
