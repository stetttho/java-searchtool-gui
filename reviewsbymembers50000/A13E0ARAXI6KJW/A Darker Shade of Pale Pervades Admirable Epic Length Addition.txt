 Similar to the anticipation that greeted "The Empire Strikes Back" or "The Two Towers", it seems unenviable to write a book that really provides the set-up for the much-awaited finale of the Harry Potter series. There is a no-win aspect to a penultimate contribution to a stratospherically popular series because you know much of the book will be devoted to whetting your appetite for the conclusion. At the same time, J.K. Rowling is savvy enough to write an epic-length story that stands on its own and exhibits her considerable narrative powers. Thankfully, she limits all the catching up to the first chapter and then goes on flights of fancy that revolve quite a bit around potions and liquids - a dark lake, the liquid mists of memories in Dumbledore's Pensieve and of course, blood and poisons. But she still spends plenty of time showing how Harry and his friends have grown up since the last book.  Personally, I like the extensive back-story behind the evil Lord Voldemort and his poor mother, even though it takes about 200 pages before Harry meets the Half-Blood Prince of the title. The wait is worth it, as Rowling fully embodies her magical world like no other except Tolkien. This time, she brings a darker tone to the proceedings, not surprising as the previous books have given inklings of this trend for some time. Where Rowling succeeds is not letting the atmosphere dampen the action. Much of the plot has to do with Harry's efforts in convincing Ron and Hermione, as well as the adult wizards, that Harry's primary nemesis Draco Malfoy and Professor Snape, Hogwarts' Potions Master and Head of Slytherin house, are not what they appear. Sharing any more than that would be criminal to die-hard fans of the series. It's enough to say that a truly spectacular conclusion awaits you at the end and of course, inevitable tragedy, and more importantly, a dramatically effective transitional point to the final book. Enjoy.
