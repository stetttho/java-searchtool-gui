 Before this recording, I have to admit that I thought Chanticleer was a pleasing though rather pristine choir, a classic case of style over substance, granted a mellifluous group of voices but not all that stirring to my ears.  Fortunately that perception has changed with this latest recording, which taps into a rich tapestry of spirituals and traditional gospel music. Recorded live at St. Ignatius Church here in San Francisco, this disc reflects pure and unbridled vocal beauty provided by the twelve men who make up Chanticleer plus an indispensable 13th voice, that of Bishop Yvette Flunder, a member of the fabled Hawkins Family Singers and a solo artist in her own right. No soul shouter, she unearths her power through her commitment to the words, an approach that grounds the fanciful vocal fireworks the men can generate.  What's nice is that this recording has no multiple tracking, no overdubs, just pure singing. Even with such familiar standards such as "Amazing Grace" and "There Is a Balm in Gilead", the combined effect of Chanticleer and Flunder is wondrous. But even by themselves, the sound these men achieve is incredibly full and rich, obviously inspired by the sacred program and nicely complemented by music director Joseph Jennings' expert arrangements. Jennings himself shows off some powerful vocal chops of his own on "You Can't Hide," "Sit Down Servant" and "Plenty Good Room". Even the one number that borders on camp, the opener "Jesus Hits Like an Atom Bomb" has a nice, doo-wop feel that allows the listener to sidle into the mainly gospel program easily. This is an unexpected surprise. Highly recommended, and I agree with the first review from Mr. White (who does a fine job on "Walk in Jerusalem")...this seems like the ideal holiday gift.
