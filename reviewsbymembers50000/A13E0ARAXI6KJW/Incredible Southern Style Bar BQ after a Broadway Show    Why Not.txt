 A crowded Southern barbecue restaurant would not have been my first inclination for a meal after watching a Broadway show, but Virgil's is a great place for a hearty, reasonably priced plate of ribs. It's right off Times Square on West 44th Street, and if you can brace yourself against the torrents of tourists performing shoulder blocks that would be the envy of a New York Giants lineman, it is well worth the effort. A friend of mine recommended it, and everything I had was tasty. I tried the chicken and ribs combo with two sides - Georgia pecan rice and country greens with bacon - and their cornbread ($19.95), and my friend had the ribs with their Memphis barbecue beans and cheese grits to go with his cornbread ($20.95). That was one huge slab, though my one critique would be to serve more than a small muffin of the cornbread to go with all that protein.  Needless to say, we were sated, which was a shame since their desserts look good. I saw a delicious-looking sweet potato pie, a personal weakness, at the next table. The service was responsive and efficient unlike a lot of the restaurant service I was experiencing in New York this past weekend. We went right after our Sunday matinee was over, so it was not quite packed. By 5PM, the line was out the door, so definitely make a reservation if you can. This is down-home cooking where you get a maroon towel instead of a napkin, so I suggest you don't wear white as the thick, molasses-smothered barbecue sauce will inevitably find itself in a most inappropriate place...not that I would know.
