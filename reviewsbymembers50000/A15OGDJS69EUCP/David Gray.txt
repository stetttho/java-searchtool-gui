 David Gray's newest release Life in Slow Motion is just that, Slow.  I found it to be nice, pretty music, but it was way too slow for my liking.    It also was not that memorable of an album.  After a listen, I could not look at the track listing and sing any memorable choruses.  It just didn't really impress me that much.    The music itself is pretty and beautiful and he's got a great voice, but the album just isn't that special.  It lack that extra something that made White Ladder such a wonderful album.
