 For as amazing as the first "Livin' Proof" release was, I expected a whole lot more.  This release really disappoints if you liked the debut. And if you'd never heard the debut before, you wouldn't be impressed at all by this one. And this is probably due to one missing piece:  DJ Premier.  With DJ Premier producing, he could even make me sound respectable!   So this album sounds very average, very non-memorable. Very generic, nothing new is added here. Overall very disappointing, but at least you can get it really cheap used!
