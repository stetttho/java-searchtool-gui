 I must first say that the create-a-player is by far the best one I've ever seen on any video game.  So if you're like me, that's a huge selling point.  You can customize everything on the guy, down to their socks and bling-bling earrings. Gameplay is really quite easy to learn and quite easy to be good at.  This may be a problem for some of the purists/realists, but for people who just want to pick up the game, play and be good, it works well.  Unlike real golf, the gameplay isn't frustrating! But what is agonizingly frustrating is the putting.  You get virtually no idea of what way the green is going.  All you have to go by is the Caddy's Advice, who tells you to aim 2 feet left and 3 feet long.  How far is a foot?  I have no idea!  It's usually just pure luck if you knock down a put of any distance.   I think the old "Golf" game on Nintendo had a better putting gameplay (and that was 15 years ago). If you can get past the putting, this game is great fun.  The career mode seems quite lengthy and will probably keep me entertained for hours upon hours.  I'd recommend this game for my money.
