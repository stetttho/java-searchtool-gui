 I found the cd's 'interesting'.  He features such a wide eclectic mix of songs: folky, jazzy, swank, electronica.  So points for that.  It is very unique.  I did find it difficult to get into because of the language barrier though.  Also some of the songs are downright sleep-inducing-slow (maybe that's what he's going for).    I would've liked to see this cut down to one tight compact single disc because there are some good cuts on there.  It's just not as tremendous as I was expecting it to be.  Pick this one up if you're into odd, different, eclectic music or French music in general.  Just don't pay full Import price - it's available for cheaper on other sites.
