 I think I am in the minority here who really don't "get" this album.  This is definitely a far cry from their past superb efforts.    I'm all for groups tinkering with their sound and trying new things, but "Get Behind Me Satan" is almost unlistenable at times.  The good songs are good riffs are nearly gone on this album.   I wonder if perhaps the White Stripes feared that they had become too popular and too mainstream with "Elephant", and decided to throw everyone a big curveball with this inaccessible album.  I ask you Amazon.com'ers, if "Get Behind Me Satan" were the White Stripes' debut cd, would anyone like this band?  Would this album be the savior of rock & roll?  I think not...  Here's hoping the next one is as good as their other efforts!    And leave the vibes/marimba to Cal Tjader or Roy Ayers :)
