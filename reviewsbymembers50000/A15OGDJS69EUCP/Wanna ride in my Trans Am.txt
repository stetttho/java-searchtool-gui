 This is a FUN double-disc collection.  Power Ballads Gold has some awfully bad (in a good way) songs on it.  There were a few songs I had never heard before, but they definitely fit the hair-band mold.  Definitely cheesey.  Definitely worth the money.  This is much better than buying all of the individual band's CDs, which probably only have one or a few good songs on them.    Rock out with your air guitar!  Good songs for singing extremely loudly on the way home from work!
