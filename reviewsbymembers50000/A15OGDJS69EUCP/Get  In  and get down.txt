 This was a hugely successful jazz album that crossed over in the 60's.  Undoubtedly a lot of my parent's generation are familiar with this one. I find about half of this cd/album is really upbeat and moving.  Very danceable.  I can definitely see how this brought new converts into the world of jazz.  This is very soulful playing.  Dancing.  Hands clapping.  Feet moving.  Head nodding. Then there's the slower songs which are a little too slow for my tastes, and serve to bring the album down a bit for me.   Overall though, a good upbeat solid feel-good album. I personally like Ramsey's Greatest Hits on MCA/Chess as a good starting place for people new to jazz.
