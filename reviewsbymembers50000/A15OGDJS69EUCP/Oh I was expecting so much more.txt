 It's almost like they're regressing back to their more hardrock days, which may be great for 13-year-olds who want to rebel against their parents, but not for me. At times, Brandon sounds like he wants to be the next Zack de la Rocha (from Rage) but he's definitely missing the mark. Plus a little thing that bugged me is that the song titles are ridiculously stupid.  Normally that's a non-issue but these seem to be really dumbed down. This feels like they're just making the album for the sake of making it.  Sounds like they're not trying to expand their sound at all; if anything it's shrunken.  It's just not so good; all-around disappointment.
