 Stet was the first "hip-hop band" - maybe not as much a real band as, say, the Roots are.  But nonetheless something different in their time. Quite an eclectic mix for '91 - sometimes fun, sometimes serious.  I think it's a slept-on old school classic.  The MC's all have their own unique great delivery.   It's surprising that they all pretty much fell off the face of the earth after this one (except for Prince Paul).   This cd's been out of print for awhile, so it might be hard to track down.
