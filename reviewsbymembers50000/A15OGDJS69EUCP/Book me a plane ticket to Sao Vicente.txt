 Cesaria Evora's voice is so heavenly, so peaceful and beautiful.  There aren't really enough adjectives to describe it, so you really should do yourself the favor of picking up some of her music. The music is very tropical-themed.  It's such a beautiful album throughout.  It keeps a really upbeat happy vibe throughout. I would highly recommend this cd to anyone looking to broaden their musical horizons.
