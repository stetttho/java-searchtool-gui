 I own Carolina and the Life Aquatic Soundtrack.  This album "Cru" is closer to the Life Aquatic soundtrack than it was to Carolina.     Cru is much more laidback and more of a chill-out album.  The songs include quite a few monkey(?) sounds in the background, which is actually kind of funny and adds to the whole tropical feeling.    I love Seu Jorge's voice.  It's very hypnotic and mellow.  He could be on his way to becoming the new century's Brazilian Bob Marley.  And no longer being an Import, it's affordable - so pick it up!
