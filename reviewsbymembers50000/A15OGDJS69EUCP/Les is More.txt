 Les Mccann is a really under-rated jazz artist from the 60s.  He plays a very soulful piano.    Much Les features some driving riffs and great backing rhythm.  The music on here is very accessible, even to non-jazz-heads.    This CD reissue even features With These Hands, which has Les singing, which is a nice change of pace.  It makes you wish he did  an entire album with vocals since he pulls it off nicely.    This is definitely good soulful piano-trio jazz.  Very recommended.
