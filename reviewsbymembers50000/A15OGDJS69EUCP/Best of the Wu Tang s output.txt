 As has been said over and over again by many other reviewers, I feel this is the best Wu-Tang album, solo or as a group, period.    GZA is the best lyricist of the group.  He has a great delivery and writes great lyrics.    It also has the best atmosphere in creating what the Wu-Tang wanted to be about: kung-fu vintage clips; Rza's razorsharp beats; great lyrics and great songs.  This is the best album that the Wu-Tang ever dropped, so it's surprising that it is generally overlooked.
