 Tonino Baliardo has put out a nice solo release from his usual stand-out work with the Gipsy Kings.  If you're a Gipsy Kings fan, you'll like this album.    Tonino's album is a little different than most Gipsy King songs in that he does not really use any vocals on the songs.  The guitar work is strong enough to stand on its own.    Tonino also features some vibes on a few songs, which gives it a nice Latin-jazz Cal Tjader-Charlie Byrd feeling, which I absolutely love.  Overall it's a great laid-back gipsy-flamenco guitar from one of the greatest guitarists around.
