 Some people give everything they like a five-star rating, but this one actually deserves it. This is a lovely, charming album from a modern alt-country singer/songwriter.  It's very reminiscent of old-time country.  It's beautiful at times. I guess my only complaint is that at times it's a little too slow.  But the faster songs really move.  So I say it's highly recommended.  I find it grows better with each listen.   Why can't they put out more music like this?!
