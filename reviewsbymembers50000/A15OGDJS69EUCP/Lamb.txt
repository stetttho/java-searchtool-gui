 I love this book and I'm a pretty picky person when it comes to liking books.  So I would highly recommend "Lamb" to anyone who enjoys a good, heartfelt, funny tale.  If you're overly religious and very devout, you may be offended by this book.    I love the character development in this book.  You really feel like you know Biff and Joshua.  The great friendship between these two makes for a great buddy story.    This book is a 4.5 star for me, only because I liked Fluke a little bit better.  This is a great book; I'd even recommend it to those of us who know little to nothing about the bible.  Great stuff!  It reads fast.
