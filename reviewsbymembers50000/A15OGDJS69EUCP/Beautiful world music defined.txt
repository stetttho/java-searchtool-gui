 WOW.  This really is a five-star cd.   Expand your boundaries of music you like by picking this up.  Even at the import price, it's well worth it. This is really beautiful music.  At times, it's sort of folky, sort of gipsy, sort of jazzy, sort of world-y.  It's great to see all these genres come together.  Ilham's voice is very rich.  The Arabic language is very pleasant on the ears for those of us who only speak English. I can't wait to get some more of his work.  Do your collection a favor and pick this one up.  You won't be disappointed.
