 I remember getting this CD when it first came out in '93.  I remember liking A Tribe Called Quest, who used jazz samples, and I wanted to get into jazz but wasn't sure where to start.   Well, this isn't exactly a good place to start if you want to get into jazz, but it is a great combination if you're interested in hip-hop flavored with jazz. This was the first Guru Jazzmatazz project and is much better than the following two.  The second one was more hip hop and the third newest one is too neo-soul for me. This is a very good cd for late night, chilling, listening.  Very mellow, very relaxed.  If you're a fan of A Tribe Called Quest's classic stuff, or if you're a fan of classic jazz/hiphop, this is a great album.
