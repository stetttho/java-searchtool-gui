 Songs for Silverman is yet another solid release from one of my generation's best pianist/songwriter.  He's turning more into a 70's Elton John or Billy Joel, but he's updated the setup for our times.    The songs are a little more slower than usual; he's missing the dumb peppy goofiness of some of his earlier albums. This album feels more personal and more authentic.  Ben's definitely getting older and it's cool watching him "grow up".  He makes great music for us nerdy white guys!
