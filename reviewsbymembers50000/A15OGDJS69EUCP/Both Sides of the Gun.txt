 I can not understand why there are so many negative reviews about Ben Harper's "Both Sides of the Gun".  I am a pretty fickle reviewer myself, but for the life of me, I can't figure out why this isn't getting any love.  Both Sides of the Gun is nicely packaged into two distinct discs.  I listened to the harder, more-rock disc first.  I thought the songs were quite good, quite catchy, and quite political.  It's nice to see someone still makes political statements on records.    The first disc, the softer, more introspective side was quite good too.  I was expecting it to be really slow and depressing, which it was not.  So I was quite happy there too.    Overall, it's a good split on two discs.  Sure, Ben could have combined the songs on to one disc, but I dig the separation.    Ben Harper hasn't differed his sound that much album-to-album, so if you liked his earlier albums, you should like Both Sides of the Gun too.  Ben's still better than 95% of the garbage out there.  He's "real" music.  Good stuff.
