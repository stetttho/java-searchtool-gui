 This album was the beginning of the end for A Tribe.  They'd produced some of the genre's greatest albums in the early 90s.   By the time this came out, hip hop was changing a bit.  You'll notice that the jazz influence was really non-existent on this one.  This has a lot more upbeat, party beats to it; which isn't to say that's bad, but to say that it doesn't seem like the Tribe I grew up on. Still, Phife and Qtip's lyrics were still solid.  One major complaint is the new guy, Consequence, who really doesn't seem to fit in.  It was a bad idea; I'm not sure what they were thinking. Still, this is a decent Tribe release.  It's far from their best but still better than most.  This was it for them (if you don't count the horrendous Love Movement); the end of an era.
