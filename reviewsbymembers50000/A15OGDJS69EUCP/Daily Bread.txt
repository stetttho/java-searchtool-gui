 Corey Harris' latest offering is solid throughout.  Corey is able to blend a lot of different types of blues together with some other genres of music.  There's some reggae touches on a few songs; some "world music" touches thrown in some others.  This makes the disc nice and varied and not-repetitive.    The songs themselves are mostly very good and very catchy (but not catchy in a corny, lame sort of way).  You may find yourself singing the chorus/humming the melody while you're sitting at your desk.  There's a couple songs I wasn't too crazy about - but they were just decent - nothing on here is bad.    So, overall, it's a very good cd.  I found mine used and it was well worth that price.  Daily Bread is a good cd in a time when music, in general, is lacking in talent.  Keep up the good work, Corey!
