 At first listen, Mylo's "Destory Rock & Roll" seemed like it would be a really good CD.  There are some cool, fun, upbeat songs on the disc.  There are a handful of stellar songs on here.    However, after trying to get through it all, the disc seems to be more of a collection of songs; not so much a cohesive album.  It's a nice collection of songs but the songs don't really vibe/ gel together a lot.  There's no real underlying theme/ feeling that runs throughout.    I think Mylo would work better as a collection of MP3's on a playlist than as an album.  I don't think this album will "destroy rock and roll"; it's just alright - not great.
