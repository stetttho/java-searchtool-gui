 The Enemy Strikes Black is my personal favorite PE album, even though Nation of Millions and Fear of a Black Planet are great too.  Apocalypse 91 is the best produced album.  The songs are all solid.  There doesn't seem to be as many skits or half-songs.    The band was just as political and militant as ever.  "By the Time I Get to Arizona" caused quite a stir here in AZ at the time and it helped us get MLK day here in this state.  Chuck D proves to be one of the best MC's in hip hop history.  Flava proves to be the premier hype man; he's the juice, boyee.   Plus, the remake of Bring tha Noize with Anthrax rocks!    Apocalypse 91 is the top PE album in a string of three very classic releases.  This is a good place to start for people who may be unfamiliar with early 90's pro-black, intelligent, militant hip hop.  Solid throughout.
