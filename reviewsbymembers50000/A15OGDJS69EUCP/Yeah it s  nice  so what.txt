 Maybe it's been too overhyped and maybe the expectations were sooo high that they'd never be reached.  Nonetheless, it's a decent album.  It's what I would call "nice".   It's stuff you could put on in the background, stuff you could put on and take a nap to, stuff you could play for your mother, stuff your girlfriend might even like. That said, it's not really that much different than the first one, which again was just "nice".  Her voice is still smooth as can be; it soothes me to sleep at times.  The songs just aren't all that memorable; I've been through it a couple times and can't recall any absolute-must-listen-to-standouts.   So buy it, hopefully cheap, because, yes, it is nice. Just don't expect to hear the reinvention of music on this cd.
