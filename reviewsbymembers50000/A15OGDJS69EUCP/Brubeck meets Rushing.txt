 An overall enjoyable collaboration between a great blues/jazz singer and the cool Brubeck quartet.  This was somewhat of an odd pairing, but the results are "nice". This turns out sounding more of a Jimmy Rushing album though than a Dave Brubeck album though. Overall it's nice, but nothing too terribly new or exciting though.
