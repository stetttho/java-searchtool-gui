 This album is considered a bop standard for good reason.  It features Benny Golson, Lee Morgan and Bobby Timmons, so it's an all-star cast of fine bop players.  I absolutely love the title track.  The album also shows some great, solo drum work on a few songs, which is quite hard to find.  It's downright head-bobbing at times.  This is very upbeat and easy to dig.   Obviously this is recommended to all jazz fans.  But this is quite accessible, so I would also recommend this (or Blue Note's Best of Art Blakey) to people who don't know a whole lot about jazz but would like to learn.
