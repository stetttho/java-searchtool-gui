 DHT's "Listen to Your Heart" is an uneven cd throughout.  I purchased it hoping that it would be upbeat, energetic, dance-able Euro-dance.  And to some degree, it is.  The title track is very popular and for good reason.  However, there's quite a bit of slower ballad-style songs.  Now this would be perfectly fine if it were a Dido album.  But I purchased this hoping for something to drive fast to.    That said, there are a few good upbeat Euro-dance songs.  However they are sometimes followed immediately by a slow song, which creates a very uneven flow to the music.    Overall, DHT is just ok.  It's not something I would listen to over and over again.
