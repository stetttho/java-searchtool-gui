 Johnny Hartman's wonderful baritone voice is on display on this album.    Unfortunately the songs a little slow and not terribly memorable.    So it's a tossup, I'm not a fan of the album as a whole, but his voice is so great that you have to appreciate the album.  I guess I could see why someone would rate this as a "5" (for his voice) or as a "1" (too slow) - so I'll give it a 3!
