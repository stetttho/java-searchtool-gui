 Matt Costa's "Songs We Sing" is really a pleasant surprise!  I found Matt from his work on Jack Johnson's "Curious George" soundtrack.    Matt Costa reminds me a bit of Jack Johnson in terms of the sparse instrumentation.  He has a good, easy-to-listen-to singing voice.  The songs are simple and very catchy.  You'll be singing the choruses by halfway through each song.  Obviously, if you're into Jack Johnson, this is a good pickup.  But to me, this album sounds like it could be from a soundtrack to the next Wes Anderson film; it could easily fit onto the Rushmore, The Life Aquatic, and The Royal Tenenbaums soundtracks.  It has that sort of "real" feel to it.  Very highly recommended.
