 Rick Trevino's "In My Dreams" really was a pleasant surprise.  I'm a big fan of Los Super Seven, which lead me to try out a Rick Trevino CD.  And this one is actually good enough to rival Los Super 7's impressive output.  The CD is a good mix of classic country mixed with Tex-Mex, Americana, and honky tonk.  I love the flameno/gipsy guitars that are sprinkled throughout the album.  I was surprised at how much I liked the cover version of "Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman".  I didn't care that much for the original by Bryan Adams, but Trevino's is spiced up nicely.    This CD is produced by Raul Malo of the Mavericks.  It definitely sounds like it has his touch on it.  I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who's a fan of Raul Malo's music and Los Super 7's CD's.  Good stuff!
