 Ministry of Sound's Annual 2006 left me with an emtpy feeling after listening to it.  It's just OK, not great. The song selection seems to be lacking.  There's not a whole lot of standouts there, unlike 2005's version which I enjoyed a lot.  A lot of the songs start sounding too much alike and the vocalists all start sounding like the same person after awhile.  That said, it's nice that you get over 2 hours of music for a reasonable price.  It's just sometimes I wonder if there's enough material to really fill up two entire discs, or if they'd have been better off pulling the 12 best songs and putting it onto one disc.  Normally the Ministry of Sound name would guarantee a good CD, but this one is just lacking that special something.  It didn't make me want to listen to it again.  I'm very unimpressed.
