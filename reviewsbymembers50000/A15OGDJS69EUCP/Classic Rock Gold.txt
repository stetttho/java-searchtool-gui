 Classic Rock "Gold" is a double disc of classic rock's best.  This 2-fer does have some good songs, but it also has some awkward inclusions.  I had heard of most of these songs, but there's a few that I hadn't.  Somehow I don't think those few should qualify as "classic" or "gold".  I wonder if this might have been better off as a single disc crammed to the maximum capacity.  Still, buying this 2-disc set is much better than buying all the individual albums.  Overall Classic Rock Gold is a nice collection.  It's just not that awe-inspiring.  I'd say it's worth a Used purchase price.
