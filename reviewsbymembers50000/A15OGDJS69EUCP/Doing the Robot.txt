 This album's Fun.  Beats are bouncy, handclaps & other random blips.  It doesn't get too repetitive like a lot of other techno dance electronica albums.  It does have the retro feel to it, so I wouldnt recommend it to the novice ears, it's more for the older crowd/college students/etc. Extra bonus:  It'll have you doing the robot - and that's a good thing!  This should be the soundtrack for all those new Mitsubishi commercials.
