 I had very high expectations for this double disc of "Reggae Gold".  I was not too familiar with a lot of the songs on the two discs. I am a big fan of Bob Marley's music though.  So I figured there would be some comparable good reggae on these two discs.  Sadly, I was not impressed by a lot of these songs.  There are a few good songs here or there, but overall, this is definitely not even in the same ballpark with the classic Bob Marley stuff.    The older stuff sounds really dated.  Meanwhile the newer stuff sounds really over-produced and corny.    I would not recommend this to casual reggae fans.  For the $20 retail price, this one is definitely not worth it.
