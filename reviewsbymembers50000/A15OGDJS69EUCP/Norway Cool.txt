 Sondre Lerche's "Duper Sessions" is theeee coolest thing to come out of Norway since Kings of Convenience!    I was a fan of Sondre's first two albums, which were more traditional singer/songwriter/folky rock.  This one though is straight-up jazz vocals.  The music swings nicely.  The backing band is very "cool".  This album has Euro-Hipster written all over it.  It sounds like it could have been recorded during the 1960's hipster craze, but without ever being cheesey.    It is difficult to write new, modern jazz songs in the Singer/Standards format.  Sondre wrote all but two of the songs,  and they are all quite good.  There are a couple songs that I found a little slow/dull, but nearly everything else is great.  I am sure Sondre's old fans will still like this "new" sound.  I'm sure he'll make some new fans too with the Duper Sessions.  Do NOT sleep on this album.  Highly recommended.
