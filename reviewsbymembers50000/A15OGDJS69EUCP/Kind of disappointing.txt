 Ultra Dance 06 is a double-disc of the hottest dance tunes so you do get your money's worth in terms of length.  However, this cd set does not live up to the other normally-good releases on Ultra records.  I found this double-disc has too many songs that sound the same - too many female vocalists over upbeat mostly bland bouncy beats.    The mixing wasn't the greatest either in between songs and that's not even something I normally notice.  Basically, there was nothing really happening here for me.  Also, there seems to be a lot overlap with the Ministry of Sound "Annual 2005" double-disc.  I would say you would be better of picking that one up instead of this one.
