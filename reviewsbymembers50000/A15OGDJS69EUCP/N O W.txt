 Nightmares on Wax "In a Space Outta Sound" is just ok.  I am having a hard time justifying having paid almost $15 for this.    That said, it's alright.  It's kind of funky, groovy, cool electronica music with some hip-hop undertones.    The main problem is that the songs never really go anywhere.  The beats for the most part are really good, but the songs drag on and don't do a lot.    After awhile it's tedious sitting through the entire 62 minutes.  This might work better as background music.    I'll probably end up trading this in.  There's nothing that "exciting" or "amazing" here.  Very average.
