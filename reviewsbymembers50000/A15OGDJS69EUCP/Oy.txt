 First off, don't buy this CD if you're really into tight beats and overly produced choruses; because that's not what the Streets (aka Mike Skinner) is really about. This album is great only if you have the time to sit and listen to it from beginning to end.  It does not make good background music. There aren't many concept albums in hiphop/rap.  Mike's flow seems a little slower on this second album.  I didn't find it as initially catchy as Original Pirate Material.  But after a second listen, it's already growing on me. The lyrics are clever.  The stories are engaging and very true to life.  I especially like that he's able to put his emotions on the table and shows how much it hurts to get dumped your girlfriend (track 10 Dry Your Eyes).  That pain is something we can all relate to and makes him seem like a regular guy.  It's something that is definitely missing from hiphop today. So if you liked Original Pirate Material, I'm sure you've already picked up A Grand...   If you're really into hip hop and that's all you listen to, and you idolize Eminem and Tupac, this probably won't be your thing.   If you're obscure music and have a hard time with all the mainstream music, or if you're some nerdy white college guy like me, you should try this one on for size.
