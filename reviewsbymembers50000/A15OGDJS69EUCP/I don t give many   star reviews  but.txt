 Life of Pi is definitely one of the best books I have ever read.  I don't consider myself much of a reader, but this is a fantastic book that I would recommend to anyone.  Life of Pi is great fiction.  It comes with a story that is almost unbelievable, but after awhile, you find yourself drawn in and basically end up living the story with Pi.    I don't want to say a whole lot about the plot, other than to read it.  I found it a little slow-going for about the first 100 pages, but it definitely took off from there.    Life of Pi is almost a religious experience in a book.  It's that good!  Fantastic fiction.  Great storytelling.  Thank you Yann Martel.  Buy it!
