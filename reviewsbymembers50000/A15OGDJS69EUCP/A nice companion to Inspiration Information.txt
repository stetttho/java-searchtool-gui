 This is a double shot of Shuggie albums on one cd, so you get almost an entire 80 minutes worth of music.  However, this cd costs a small fortune.  It's amazing that both albums were recorded when he was still a teenager.  There seems to be a lot of overlap with 'Inspiration Information', most notably 'Strawberry Letter 23'.  The albums feature good blues-guitar playing.  The music was very much ahead of its time and very much ahead of his age.  Overall, there's lots of good solid blues/R&B here.    As a side note, I swear a lot of the instrumental licks have been sampled by hiphop throughout the years; they're stone-cold grooving at times!  This double of Shuggie is good stuff, especially if you liked Inspiration Information.  I'd say it's almost better than that one because this features more vocal tracks.  A little pricey though....
