 To the Parliament superfan, this would be a great collection.  To the casual fan though, this double-disc collection ends up being waaaaay too much Parliament.  You'd be much better off with an edited shortened one-disc CD.    I did find about half of the songs to be extremely grooving and funky.  The other half seemed to drag on forever.    I will say that it is cool to hear the originals after hearing Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and every other West Coast gangsta rapper sample these songs to death (oftentimes without credit to George Clinton).    Overall, a great collection for the diehard P-Funk fans; a little overwhelming for the casual fan.
