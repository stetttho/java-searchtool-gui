 This is excellent, quality, "different" (most people won't own any other African music) for your collection. Pop it on and amaze your friends with your eclectic taste.   At points this cd sounds very similar to BVSC, the lead singer sounds like he could front the group - heck, I think they do one of their songs on track 8 El Son Te Llama.  I wonder why this cd hasn't gotten the publicity that the Buena Vista Social Club received a few years ago - or maybe it just hasn't happened YET because it really should.   Try it, you'll probably like it....
