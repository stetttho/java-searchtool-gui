 overall the game is very average. i'd have a very hard time ever justifying fifty bucks on a Wrestling game. there are a lot of characters to choose from, even when you first turn it on. there's a decent control-a-wrestler which is fun to make a obesely hideous bad-dressed wrestler with a funny name. i would imagine it could be more fun if you had four friends together beating the tar out of each other. but to me, these wrestling/ fighting games get stale and repetitive after about a week. i'd say legends of wrestling II would make a good renter, but would be a poor use of your fifty dollars.
