 This is a one disc set of a slimmed down version of the three-disc remix set which is available for a lot more money.    It is difficult to remix Depeche Mode when they have such great songs to begin with.  So I find it hard to add anything new to the originals to make them seem better.    Some of the beats are okay and some remixes work better than others.  The list price is way too much for what you get.  Overall though, you'd be much better starting with the individual albums themselves.
