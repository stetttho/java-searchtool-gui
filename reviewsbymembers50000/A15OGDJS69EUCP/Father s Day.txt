 I picked up Father MC's "Father's Day" used for a couple dollars.  And that's really all that you should pay for it.  The first two songs were quite popular and were minor hits back in the day.  They are good examples of the New Jack swing/hip-hop that only lasted a couple of years.  However, after the first couple of songs, it quickly falls off.  I remember having this album back when it came out.  I wasn't thaaaat into it even back then.  Sorry Father MC, this one hasn't aged nicely.
