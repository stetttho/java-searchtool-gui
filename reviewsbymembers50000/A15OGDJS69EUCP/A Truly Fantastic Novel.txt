 Everything you could possibly want to know about the book has already been said over and over in previous reviews.  So I'll leave it as this - Middlesex is a great book.    The book is 500+ pages long, which at first seems like a daunting task.  However, it's a quick reader.  It's an extremely captivating and enthralling story.  You won't want to put it down.    I don't like giving a lot of five-star reviews, but I really loved this book.  I would highly recommend Middlesex to anyone who likes good, strange, quirky fiction.
