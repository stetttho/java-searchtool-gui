 "Dust My Broom" by Boozoo Bajou is getting a lot of high praise these days and it's actually warranted.  There are a lot of downtempo laidback chill albums out there and this is one of the better ones.  There's a nice mix of music between downtempo, chill, reggae/dub, and some American blues thrown in.  Add all that together and cook over some slow beats and you've got "Dust My Broom".    I enjoyed it.  It's a laidback, slower album, good for hanging out or de-stressing.  Good stuff from the stellar K7 label.
