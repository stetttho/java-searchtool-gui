 Taylor Hawkins & the Coattail Riders debut not only features a great name, but good music as well. Now this album is not quite as good as the Foo Fighters stuff, but nonetheless, it is surprisingly good.  TH&CR has more of a retro-rocker feel to it. More of a rockin' 1970's vibe to it. At times a classic Southern rock feel. But you can definitely hear the Foo Fighters influences in there too. And Taylor is actually a good lead singer - who knew?  All in all, it's a good CD, but, it's not receiving much attention since it's not all that special/memorable.  It's good, not great - 3 stars.
