 Wow, this is such a great album throughout.  One bonus is that it's relatively short and there are no wasted, throwaway tracks.  This should be required listening for anyone who's into punk music.  Actually, anyone who loves the new Green Day 'American Idiot' CD should be required to listen to SD.  It's shocking that this has held up so well 15+ years later.  I just listened to it and swear that musically it could have been put out in 2005.  Good punk still sounds good 15 years later.   Plus with the new focus on the late Johnny Cash, you get a kickin' cover of 'Ring of Fire'.  Buy it - it's a total bargain at $7.97 here!
