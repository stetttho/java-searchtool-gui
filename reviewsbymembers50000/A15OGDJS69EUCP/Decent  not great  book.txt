 I picked this up because I thought the lead character sounded interesting: a Nigerian teenager, who is named Elvis, who is also an Elvis impersanator.  By the end of the book though, I hardly feel like I know Elvis.  I feel like I better know his friend Redemption (great name) even though he only appears a few times.  I could even imagine the King of Beggars (another great name) better than Elvis.  He just was very blah as a central character.  By the end of the book I almost found him annoying.  There are so many of Elvis' stories thrown in the book that it becomes too much to be cohesive.    However, there are enough interesting insights into life in Nigeria in the early 80s to make it interesting.    As a side note, I found the dropping of the music that was playing in the background to be annoying.  It seemed like the author was trying to show how "real" and "authentic" the music is to the time and setting.  It just felt really forced in there and it stuck out noticeably to me.
