 i recently upgraded from the ps2 to an xbox and this was the 1st game i bought. my roommate walked in and thought i was watching a game on television - the graphics are quite impressive. gameplay and ball control is definitely more lifelike. when i first played on default settings, i got beat 1-0! i was expecting to walk out and romp all over the computer using my old fifa 2002 skills. this game is definitely a step up on realism.  i was quite impressed with difficulty in controlling the ball when running the ball. also thankfully they've gotten rid of the ability to basically walk thru people using angles. the only thing i'd like is more customability. you can't create your own players/teams. also i'd love to see EA bring over an indepth Franchise Mode (ala Madden 2003) with computers making transfers on their own, players retiring, signing new players, players attributes inc/decreasing based on performance, etc.  but those are just my petty complaints though. the game overall is very impressive and still the defining soccer game out there.
