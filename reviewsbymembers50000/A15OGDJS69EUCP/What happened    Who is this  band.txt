 I have no idea what happened on this album. This album hardly sounds like a Roots album at all. I hope this isn't the beginning of the end for one of the greatest hip hop groups of all time. 'Tipping Point' does not have the live-instrument feel to it like the Roots are known for. It sounds overly produced. The beats sound very produced; you could hear this from any producer.  The Roots usually have a very definitive and unique sound to them; not so on this one. In fact, there more than a few Samples on the album, which is something the old Roots never used to do.   Also, there a couple songs where they're trying to sound hardcore.  "The Mic" sounds like it could be off of an ODB or Onyx album; it's a loud, grimey, annoying posse track. To sum up, this is a generous two stars because only a few songs are promising.  On previous albums, nearly every song was a winner.   Anyone who rates "Tipping Point" as a Five-star album must have never heard any of the old "classic" Roots.   Do yourself a favor and pick up the old stuff.  Start with "Do you want more?!" and work forward.
