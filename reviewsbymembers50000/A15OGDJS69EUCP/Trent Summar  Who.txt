 By dumb luck, I found this at a listening station at a Hasting's in Flagstaff, AZ.    Trent Summar's self-titled debut is a very authentic/modern take on real rockin' country music.  It features a good cover of "It Never Rains in Southern California".  It's just good ol' American country/rock music, good stuff. Here's hoping these guys do something else since this was a really promising debut.
