 Soul Mosaic is a really solid album front to back.  This album is more soul, funk, r&b based.  There are a lot more guest vocalists on this release than any of his previous work.  If you liked 'Mastered the Art' for its mix of electronica head-nod beats and hip-hop, this new one may not be for you. If you liked his old acid jazz days, there isn't a whole lot of that on here either. It's definitely grown on me after a few listens.  He has an impeccable track record, so the faithful should definitely check it out and see where he's headed now.  It's good stuff!
