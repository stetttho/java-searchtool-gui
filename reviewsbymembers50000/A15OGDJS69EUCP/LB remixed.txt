 "Same S!@#$ Different Day" is one of those rare occurances where the remix album is stronger than the original album.  I thought the original Later That Day was good but it didn't do that much for me.    This remix album is underground hiphop from the bay area, with good beats.    The Quannum-label as usual, means it's good stuff.  The beats are stronger on the remix album.  The songs seem to have more energy.  It's odd that the album is tighter on the second go-around.  Well worth the affordable list price!
