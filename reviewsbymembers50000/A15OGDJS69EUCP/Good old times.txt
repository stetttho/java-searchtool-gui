 Licensed To Ill was one of my very first cassette tapes I ever owned.  I owned this back in Ames, Iowa when I was about 9 or 10 years old.  I remember being very afraid of getting caught listening to this tape because it contained quite a few bad words for its time.  There some absolute classics on this album.  This album launched a very successful career for the B-Boys.  This is a good-times record.  Licensed to Ill is all about fun, and has a great party atmosphere.  Also, it was one of the first albums to blend rock and hip-hop.  Groundbreaking for its time, it still rocks today!
