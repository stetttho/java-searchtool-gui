 Eros' "9" is a fine release from the Italian pop-song singer.  Eros normally sings in Italian, however this is the Spanish language version of the same album available in Italian.  Spanish and Italian are very similar.  If you're like me and you have a few years of high school Spanish, you'll enjoy this.  First off, his voice is great; he has a wonderful beautiful full voice.  He's more pop-oriented than the other opera singers.    Eros' music is much more upbeat and fun.  At times it's almost cheesy latin rock songs, but I like it;  it never gets corny.  "9" is a very solid album that I'm sure the rest of the world enjoys very much.    Eros is one super cool dude.  It's too bad that Andrea Bocelli is more well-known, more critically acclaimed, and probably much richer.  Those of us in-the-know can still dig on Eros.
