 Is this album disappointing - of course. Why? Because everyone, myself included, expected this to be "The Man Who" part deux or "Invisible Band" II.  Still it's not bad, it's definitely not great though.  Upon second listen, it sounded much better than the initial "Hmmm I don't know about this" first time through.  It does come off as preachy at times.  It'll go from a political song then jump back to a love song - not consistent.  There are some good songs and at times it sounds like the "old" Travis that lots of people love.  It's definitely only for those existing Travis fans, as I don't think this album will really draw any new fans in - it will only exclude some of its existing fans.  So overall it's middle of the road.  Hopefully they'll bounce back on the next one because at times, on this disc, you can still here the wonderful potential of this band.
