 This album is billed as a meeting of Charlie Hunter and electronica guy Bobby Previte, with special guest on sax Greg Osby.  So I figured this would be typical grooving Charlie Hunter jams.  Boy was I way off.    Beware that this album is very avant-garde and the songs never really materialize.  It's just way too experiemental for my taste; it's almost hard to listen to.  I really expected better given Charlie Hunter's usually-solid CD's.  I guess he's trying to do something different...
