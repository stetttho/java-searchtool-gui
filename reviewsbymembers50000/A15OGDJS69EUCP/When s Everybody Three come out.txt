 I normally can't get super-excited about in-the-mix DJ sets of other people's songs, but this one is different.  I really do love this double disc of Everybody Too.  It's very upbeat, good driving-fast music; very catchy and danceable.  There are great beats all over this two-plus hours.    I love Sander's own creation "The Fruit", which is really damn funky.  He should do an entire album of his own songs if they're all going to sound that good.  Everybody Too is a really good double-disc in a rather jumbled double-disc-dance-field.  Dig it.
