 ...Actually it's a pretty good cd. At times it reminds me of Weezer, at times it reminds me of some of the newer British rock bands, sometimes Phantom Planet.. Almost always, I say "this sounds kind of like...". So it's a good cd, just that. Good. Not 5-star-great. It's nothing groundbreaking. Just good popular rock and roll - 3 stars though.
