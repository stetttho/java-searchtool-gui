 The master of the bossa nova's best work on Verve.  And it's dirt cheap! This is a great introduction to the bossa nova-based jazz of the 60's.  I'd start here and see if you like it, then branch out into the actual albums by some of the other related artists (some of whom can be found on this cd). The music is really smooth, calm, soothing, very tropical, world feel to it.  The Portugeuse language sounds so beautiful.   A nice vibe to mellow out to.  Good stuff!
