 The Redwalls are a cool British-sounding American band who definitely has good taste in music.  The music on De Nova is quite good.  It's very Beatles/Rolling Stones-esque. The singer sometimes reminds of Bob Dylan.  So it's very retro sounding.  In terms of the actual sound of the songs, they sound great.  This is good music.  However, the songs and the lyrics are not that great and memorable as the musical gods they clearly idolize.  Overall, I think these guys are very talented musicians, but the cd left me disappointed.  It didn't really move me.  I didn't hear any really catchy singles.  It was just good/average.  I don't think this album is going to age nicely over time like the old 60s albums do.
