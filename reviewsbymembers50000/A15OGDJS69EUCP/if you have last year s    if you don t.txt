 Oh those clever folks at EA are making a bundle by repackaging last year's games as this year's games!    Basically, if you owned last year's Tiger Woods 2004, I don't think there are enough upgrades to warrant a full-on $50 (unless you a lot of disposable income).    If you don't have last year's though, I would highly recommend picking this one up.  It's easy to play, fun to play, there's tons of stuff to customize.  It still has the ultimate hands-down best create-a-player ever.    The Tiger Proofing of courses makes the game better by making it harder.  This game is a little on the easy side, especially after you've played it for awhile.  So overall, buy it if you want a great golf game and don't have one already.  If you owned last year's version, rent it first or try to pick it up used.  P.S. - In Legend Pursuit, you play against "The Hustler" who is a created player that Justin Timberlake helped design.  Basically he's a old 1920s gangster version of Justin who uses an 8-ball as his golf ball.  If you defeat him, you will get the password "THETENNESSEEKID".  Input this at the Password screen and it will allow you to play as Justin Timberlake himself.
