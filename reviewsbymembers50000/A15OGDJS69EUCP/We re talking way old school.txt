 I got a pair of these for Xmas and was amazed that they're making these shoes again. These are very retro, Walter Payton days... Positives - the whole line of Tai Chi's are very cool looking, very retro, lots of different colors to choose from.  Mine came with both white and blue laces to choose from. The cool pouch on the side of the shoes is a conversation piece. Not so positives - These aren't very comfortable shoes.  They're not horrible but they're definitely not cushy like a pair of New Balance.  Also they seem a little overpriced for what you're getting. So get them if you're looking to relive the '80s and only plan on wearing them every now and then.
