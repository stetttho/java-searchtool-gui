 "Victor Davies" self-titled cd is surprisingly good.  Features a mix of electronica, bossa nova, down-tempo/chill, r&b singing - so it's a unique blend of styles. I find it very relaxing and soothing.  Very solid throughout.  The Remixes album is just as good also and worth picking up if you enjoy this one.
