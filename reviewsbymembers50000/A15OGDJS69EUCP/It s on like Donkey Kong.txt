 Deep Dish's newest CD is really quite good and very deserving of 4-stars.  "George Is On" actually reminded me a lot of BT's superb "Movement in Still Life" CD from a few years ago.  I say this because it has a lot of different types of electronica/ techno/ dance styles throughout.    There is a great balance of vocals vs. non-vocals.  There's also a good mix between guy-vocals vs. girl-vocals.  The album never gets old and repetitive.  Each song is new and different enough from the next to make it very worthy of repeat listenings.  "George Is On" also features a very cool remix of a Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac song "Dreams", which you may not know from the title.  But it's the song that goes "Thunder only happens when it's raining.... players only love you when they're playing."  So I'm sure you've heard it before, but never like this.  There's also a cool mash-up mix of the hugely popular "Flashdance" with the Dire Straits' "Money For Nothing".    Both songs are quite old, but they get a very cool updated treatment by Deep Dish.  The second disc full of remixes was a bit of overkill to me.  However, the first one's very good and very solid throughout.  Highly recommended!
