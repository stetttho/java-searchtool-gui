 "Wow" is all I can say about Tom Armstrong's cd here. This release is such a pleasant surprise in today's modern times.  It seriously sounds straight out of the classic '50s country era.  A good honkytonk voice, great authentic-sound on the instruments, great storytelling/lyrics in the songs.   This is one of those odd finds that you'll hopefully enjoy as much as I do. Simply amazing!
