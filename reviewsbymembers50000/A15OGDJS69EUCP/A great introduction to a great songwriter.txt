 Could Greg Brown be the best singer/songwriter-type of our generation?  Who knows - make your cases for a lot of other people, but you can certainly make a case for this guy.   Brown's music is simple guitar-based, he's got a great smoky storytelling voice, lyrics are smart, songs are well-written, stories are funny at times and it makes you want to cry at times - basically it's just really good music...   This is a great way (and an affordable way) to get an introduction to Greg Brown's rather large collection of music.
