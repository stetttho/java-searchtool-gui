 Late Night with King Britt is a pretty mellow downbeat album.  It has a slower more R&B flavor to the music.  This is good for late night listening.    I've actually used it to drive to work with for the calming effect it has on me (traffic in Phx is awful).    On the same note, there are hundreds of other downbeat/ chill albums out there and this one's not exactly breaking new ground here.    Overall, a good album, not a great one.  I'm not sure it's worth the whopping overpriced listing of $17.98, but it'd definitely be worth a used price.
