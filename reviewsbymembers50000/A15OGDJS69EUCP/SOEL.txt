 Another stellar release from Ludovic Navarre of St. Germain fame and acclaim.  This album continues with a fresh new sound mixing jazz, old 70's style funk, a little hip hop, and a world vibe together into a very solid enjoyable jazzy mix. I found myself listening to this one over and over, which is rare for me.  It's really good and highly recommended. A note though - you should be able to find it cheaper out there than the horrendous overprice listed here.
