 I had never heard of Marcos Valle before this but found it quite relaxing and enjoyable.    Antologia is a sublime mix of music from a highly regarded Brazilian singer/songwriter.  There's some folky songs, lots of lush beautiful sounding music.  I find it very mellow and relaxing,  breezy and chill.  Disc 1 is more 60s-bossa nova.  Disc 2 is more 70s feel to it and it's a little more funky.  Plus it's all in Portuguese which is a very cool language to hear sung.
