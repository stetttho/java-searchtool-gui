 I've never figured out why Rhett and his band, the Old 97's, are relatively unknowns.  I am not sure what the label is trying to do with his solo career (go the Rob Thomas route?), because Rhett is way more talented of a musician/ songwriter.   I would hate to see him completely sell out and go soft...  That said, Rhett Miller (Old 97's) makes catchy, upbeat Americana-rock songs.  And he's been doing it for quite awhile now.  Luckily, "The Believer" continues the trend.    The songs are mostly acoustic-guitar driven, upbeat, happy songs with catchy choruses.  You'll be singing the choruses before the songs are finished.    I would recommend this to fans of the Jayhawks, Son Volt/Wilco, Jack Johnson, Pete Yorn, Ryan Adams, Ray Lamontagne, Fountains of Wayne, etc.  Recommended!
