 I'm actually surprised that I like this EP release a whole lot better than the Rock N Roll whole cd.  This is really beautiful at times.  Very good stuff.  I can't believe they were hesitant to put this out.  This seems more "real" than the Rock N Roll release.  This is more of what might be in his diary, in his heart.... And I actually like the fact that it's only about half an hour long.  I can get through it all in one drive to work.  Then after a long day, I can do it all again.  Here's hoping for some more good stuff on Part 2 of the EP>
