 This was Guru's second Jazzmatazz project.  I purchased this one back in the day solely on having loved the first one. Jazzmatazz II is solid; not spectacular like the first one.  It still has some jazz feel to it but not as much.  It's more hip hop but it's still very chill and laidback.   I like the Jamiroquai song; funny to think that they were no-names back then before blowing up a few years later. Very soulful, mellow, good late-nite listening.
