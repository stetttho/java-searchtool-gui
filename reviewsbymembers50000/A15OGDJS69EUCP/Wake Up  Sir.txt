 "Wake Up, Sir" by Jonathan Ames is an enjoyable read.  It reads quickly, is sort of funny, and is very entertaining.  I thought it started out slowly and wasn't sure if I was going to like it, but it picked up quite a bit after about the first main section.  The narrator/protagonist, Alan Blair, is quite a character.  He's a raging alcoholic, but in a funny sort of way.  You almost feel bad for the guy.  His adventures are very memorable.  Alan has a personal valet named Jeeves.  You don't get to know too much about Jeeves, as he's sort of a guarded, detached character.    Overall, there is a lot of good character development in this book.  The tales of Alan going to the artist colony are great.  This is a good book with some unforgettable parts.  It starts off slowly, but I found it well worth my time.
