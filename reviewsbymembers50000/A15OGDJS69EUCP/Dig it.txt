 This is my first Mavericks album so I wasn't sure what to expect.... so I must say I'm very impressed. The closest thing I could say is that it kind of sounds like Roy Orbison if he were still alive and making modern music.  It's got that kind of country/rockabilly/beautiful voice, good American music, vibe to it.   Very good stuff.... Raul Malo should change his name to Raul Bueno!
