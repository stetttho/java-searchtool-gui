 This cd is a really tight mix of old hard-to-find Eastern European classic jazz (60's, 70's) Remixed with modern electronica beats.   This is similar to the stuff you'll find on the Verve Remixed efforts.  You could also compare it to some of the popular stuff on the Jazznova JCR Compost labels. It's got that jazz-head vibe to it. You don't need to be familiar with the original recordings, which are very obscure.   The sounds are very fresh, with nice quality remixing work.  Overall solid. Order it from the Cosmic Sounds website if you're interested.
