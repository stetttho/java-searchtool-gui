 Michael Buble's debut was great.  His proper follow-up studio album  "It's Time" is just as good, if not better.  The voice is great.  Very warm and entertaining.  He's not like some other male jazz singers who you either like or hate.    The instrumentation is really cool and laidback.  Very cool hipster atmosphere throughout.    This is timeless music and I'm sure it'll still sound good 10 or 20 years from now.  Highly recommended!
