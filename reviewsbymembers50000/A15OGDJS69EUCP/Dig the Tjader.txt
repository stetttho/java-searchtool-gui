 Here and There is a solid live effort from the late 70's from the Latin jazz master of the vibes.  It's a very laid-back effort.  There's great vibes-playing as always with any Tjader cd.  I find this CD to be more laid-back than usual though.  It settles into a low mellow mood.    I find that some of the electric piano gets a little old after awhile though.  I do love track 9 "Morning" which is one of the finer versions of that song.    Overall a great Tjader release from the latter-end of his great career.
