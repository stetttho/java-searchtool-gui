 If you didn't look at the booklet, you could almost envision seeing this album made thirty years ago, somewhere around the end of the 60's. It has a real timeless feel to it. At times it sounds kind of like the Doors - mostly because of the prominent use of the organ in some songs. At times though, it sounds kind of campy and pirate-y (hence the Arrr matey), but I can live with those couple instances.  Overall very impressive debut. Good stuff.
