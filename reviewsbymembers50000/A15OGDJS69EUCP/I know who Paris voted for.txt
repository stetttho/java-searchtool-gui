 This was a super-militant release from the Black Panther rapper.  The album is feverishly anti-Bush in its message.    Paris uses militant beats to match up with militant raps; however, it's not quite on par with Public Enemy's work at the time.  It's quite good in its conscious efforts.  Overall some songs are off the target, but there are a few good keepers.  This was very shocking for its time - Paris had a hard time getting any press as the government wanted his releases silenced.  So this album becomes more interesting now that Bush is president, again.  It's worth the cheap used price.
