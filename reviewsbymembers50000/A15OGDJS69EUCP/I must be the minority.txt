 First off, Aaron Neville has a beautiful voice, so he gets points for having such a unique voice. However, I found nearly all of this album "Nature Boy" to be way too slow. This is almost sleep-inducing music.   I've heard a lot of these standards before and they are not usually done this slow.  So I would be listening to a familiar song, waiting for it to pick up anytime now, but it never did.  +'s Neville's voice, the selection of familiar songs, Roy Hargrove sounds great as a guest on trumpet/flugelhorn -'s The whole pace of the album. Just generally too s-l-o-w. Overall, I'll have to disagree with the majority and say this one's not worth the money.
