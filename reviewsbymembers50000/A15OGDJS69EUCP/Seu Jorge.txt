 Seu Jorge's complete set of David Bowie covers for the Life Aquatic Soundtrack is a decent cd.  It covers fourteen songs; the soundtrack only has five.    Those five were probably the best of the bunch and were chosen for a reason to be in the movie.  The remaining nine "bonus" songs you get on this CD are nice if you're a big fan of Seu's.    Otherwise, I would say stick to the soundtrack only.  Seu + solo guitar for this many tracks kind of gets repetitive after awhile.  However, it's still nice, cool, mellow music.
