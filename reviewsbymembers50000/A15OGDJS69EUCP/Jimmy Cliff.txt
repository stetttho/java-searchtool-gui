 This is actually my second Jimmy Cliff collection.  I have his best of from Mango/Island, which is his earlier work.  There's not much duplication from that album, which is also recommended.  This one features a lot of his later work when reggae, in general, got a little more cheesy and over-produced.  Jimmy Cliff's earlier stuff is much rawer.    On this album though, despite being from a bad time in reggae, nearly every one of the songs is quite good.  There are some good, bouncy, upbeat, more-synthesized beats.  The choruses are strong and easy to get into.    Also, this compilation features "I Can See Clearly Now" from Cool Runnings, which means you don't have to buy the soundtrack just to get this one great song.  Overall this is really good, fun music.  A good intro to Jimmy Cliff.  Also, it's definitely a good starting point for any reggae beginner.
