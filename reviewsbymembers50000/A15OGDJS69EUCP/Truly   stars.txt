 Ahmad Jamal's "The Awakening" is one of my favorite jazz albums.    This is a very beautiful piano-based trio jazz album.  It features delicate playing by Ahmad on the piano.    The whole vibe of the music is very cool and laidback; a very mellow record with a very intimate feeling.  This is one of the most unknown, un-hyped greatest albums.  Pick it up!
