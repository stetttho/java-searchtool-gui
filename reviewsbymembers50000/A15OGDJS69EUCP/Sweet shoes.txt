 I own both the White and the Black Samba Milleniums.  They're very comfortable once they're broken in.  They're great for indoor soccer use; but they're also comfy for regular everyday use.   The only gripe is if you buy the white, be careful with them. It's very easy to dirty up the white suede toe area.  It's almost impossible to get it clean if you get it dirty.  I think the white look very nice but they're difficult to keep clean, so I'd stick to the good old original color (black). Great looking shoes.  Good feel.  Decent price.
