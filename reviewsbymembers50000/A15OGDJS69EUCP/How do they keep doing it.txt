 How do they keep doing it?  By that I mean, how do they keep making this game worse year after year? The game itself is beautiful when you get on the pitch. Again, like last year, it's almost like watching real tv when you're playing. Team depth and selection are super.  They've got three English divisions and two German divisions, two Italian divisions.  This is great for the career mode where you can take a team from a lower division and try to get them moved up into the big leagues next year. It's too bad all of this is ruined in the actual gameplay. FIFA used to be a ton of fun to play a few years ago. Each year though the gameplay seems to get worse.  It seems like you have to learn a brand new game each year. The controls are quite bad this year.  I never feel in control of the ball.  Shooting/scoring is difficult.  Breaking down defenses is difficult even in the default setting.  Part of this is because sending guys on runs is downright impossible.  They took it off of the left trigger and moved it into a complicated sequence of buttons.  (So now the left trigger is used as the 'Walk' function - ooooh I so needed that!!!!) I found this year's version extremely frustrating - as in throw-down-your-controller-and-turn-off-the-stupid-xbox-frustrating.  It's so bad I'm to the point of not even wanting to try to get better at it - yes, I think it's thaaaat bad.   EA, you've done a great job ruining a great franchise.  Rent this one first if you can find it available to rent!
