 "Mejico Maxico" by MIS is a super-cool, super-hip DJ/producer cd from Mexico City.  I found the music very spacey and forward-thinking.  It's tons of fun.  It's a little goofy at times, but never cheesey.  The music is upbeat and happy.  There are some Mexican influences throughout.  You don't need to speak Spanish to enjoy this CD.  Overall, a really cool CD.  Very promising debut disc - all-around good stuff!
