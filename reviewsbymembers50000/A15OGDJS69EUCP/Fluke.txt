 "Fluke" really is a 5-star book and I'm normally not too fond of giving out 5-stars.  Christopher Moore tells a great story.  It's hugely imaginative.  It's also very funny.  It helps a little bit if you've been to Maui and can relate to some of the places that Moore mentions.  If you haven't been, it'll make you want to travel to Lahaina and go whale watching off Maui.    "Fluke" is one of my favorite books and I'm not much of an avid reader.  It's a quick read and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes good fiction.
