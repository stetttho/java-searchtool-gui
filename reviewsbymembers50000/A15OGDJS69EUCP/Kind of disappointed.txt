 This is tabbed the "Legendary" Bobby Darin, but it doesn't live up to such a lofty title.  I must say that I bought this for a couple of his classic songs, especially Mack the Knife.    I should have paid more attention to the track listing because some of the more-known songs are Live versions in which he half-sings them, half-talks to the crowd. So if you're looking for the original versions of the songs, please look elsewhere.    That said, it is interesting to hear Darin in a sort of Vegas-lounge act setting.  It gives you a definite feeling of the 60's rat-pack-era.    Overall though, I don't think it's worth the price and therefore I feel a tiny bit disappointed.  It's not bad, but it's definitely not what I was hoping for.  It won't make it into heavy rotation in my cd collection.  Two stars.
