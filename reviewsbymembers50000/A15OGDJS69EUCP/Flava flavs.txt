 This is a collection of modern bhangra and indian-influenced music, made mostly by British groups.    The cd spans a few musical genres, but all with a distinct Indian musical flair attached.  Some songs are very hot and catchy while some are just ok.  I think a lot of this music could eventually catch on and go more mainstream because the beats are so creative.  Overall it's a good overview of a different type of music though.  A good way to sample a bunch of quality relatively-unknown artists at a semi-reasonable price.  3.5 stars.
