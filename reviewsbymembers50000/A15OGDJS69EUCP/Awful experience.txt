 We use this HP 5550c scanner at my work. Or rather, we attempt to use this scanner at work.  The 5550c scanner jams whenever we try to feed more than two or three pages at a time. Then the feeder has a deathgrip on the document when you're trying to pull the document out.  We've been scanning our checks at work before electronically depositing them. It's scary when you almost rip a check because the stupid scanner won't let go of it.  Basically, it's a horrible waste of your money. Everyone in my department HATES it. We can't wait to replace it!
