 The Dead 60's is a somewhat misnamed band since they sound more like the Clash than anyone, and the Clash weren't around in the 1960's.    They also have a striking resemblance to the Kaiser Chiefs.  This cd doesn't really differentiate itself from a lot of similar-sounding music, be it new or old.  The Dead 60's CD, though, is good music.  It's good British retro-garage rock with hints of reggae/ska thrown in.  I don't see how people could dislike the band.  I'm sure both bands (K-Chiefs and Dead 60s) are very hip and cool to listen to nowadays, with this new retro-meets-modern approach to things.  However, I wonder if these CD's will have any staying power like the Clash do.    Did I think it's a good cd and enjoyable for the first listen?  I guess so.    But will I still be listening to this CD six months or a year from now?  I doubt it.
