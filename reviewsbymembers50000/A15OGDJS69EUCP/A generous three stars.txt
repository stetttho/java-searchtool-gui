 Seems like I'm in the minority here of thinking that this is somehow earth-shattering-ground-breaking stuff... for me, it's overall a disappointment. The Space "Junk" could be called something else, not suitable for print. There are a few songs that are reprised with more instruments and seem a little more lively and familiar the second time you here them - which makes me wonder why he didn't just do the whole album like that. As a whole, the album didn't excite me at all; it's sleep inducing. Nothing too memorable to make me want to jump back and play it again. But hey, it's still Jay Farrar, so hence the two and a half/three star rating... And here's a really big question of mine - if this cd came out with someone else's name on it (someone that we'd never heard of before), what would the reviews be then?? Probably not that good I suspect.
