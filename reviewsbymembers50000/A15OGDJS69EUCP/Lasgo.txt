 I'm not normally a fan of Euro vocal trance but this is quite good for the genre.  Obviously, the first song "Surrender" is a big hit, probably the best on the album, and has already appeared on Ministry of Sound's definitive 2005 double-disc.  But the rest of the songs are similar.  It gets a little too similar though after awhile.  13 songs with all female vocalists.  Not a whole lot of instrumentals, which is too bad because because the beats are quite good, upbeat and fun.  Maybe they could've used a male voice here and there to break it up a bit?  Overall though, it's hard to not like this group.  They're catchy fun and upbeat - it's sort of like Abba for the modern times.  Decent stuff.
