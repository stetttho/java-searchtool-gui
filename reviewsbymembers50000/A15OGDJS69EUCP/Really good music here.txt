 This is a wonderful collaboration between Ben Harper and the Blind Boys of Alabama which is a group of old gospel singers.  There Will Be a Light plays out more as a Ben Harper album as he sings lead vocals on nearly all of the songs.  The Blind Boys are merely backup singers, but what a superb backing group they are!  The music is really good, and it's more upbeat than I expected it to be.  As for a gospel album, this music is definitely accessible for people who don't like gospel music.    This was a beautiful matching of two talents and it is very well done.  Highly recommended!
