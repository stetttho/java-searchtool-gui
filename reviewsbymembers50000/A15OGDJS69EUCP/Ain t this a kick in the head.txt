 Man, this is by far the best Frank Sinatra album I've heard! The whole lineup is full of all-stars:  Frank on vocals, Count Basie on piano, and Quincy Jones conducting/arranging. Very upbeat and swinging.  Solid songs throughout - no real disappointments on any of them. And it helps that it's got my favorite Sinatra song "Fly me to the Moon".  The only complaint is that it's not long enough. This music still sounds good to this day - a whopping 40 years later! Well worth the discounted price.
