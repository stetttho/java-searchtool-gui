 After reading the case, I rented this at Blockbuster based on the top-notch cast and what sounded like a good, cute, funny plot.  Tiptoes is none of those things.  The acting was bad and that was surprising given the cast.  I could not feel any sort of connection between Matthew McConaughey and Kate Beckinsale - much less that they could be living together and expecting a child.  Gary Oldman is painful to watch - he hobbles around cramped into a dwarf outfit.  Very Dorf-ish.    And I have no idea what Peter Dinklage and Patricia Arquette added to the movie.  They seem like they are from a completely different movie.  The acting seems like it was done in one take.  It was very painful trying to make it through 90 minutes of this trainwreck.  All and all, a total disaster.
