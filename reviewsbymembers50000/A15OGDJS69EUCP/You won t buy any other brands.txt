 I used to rave about Nike's but after getting a pair of these New Balance's, I don't think I'll ever buy another pair.  They are waaaaay comfortable.   It's like walking on a big comfy couch. It's nice that they come in width's for people with narrow feet to wide feet.  Go try a pair on and get your sizing correct before ordering online. And they're made in the good ol' USofA.
