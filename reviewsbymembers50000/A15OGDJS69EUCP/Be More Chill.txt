 "Be More Chill" by Ned Vizzini is a really cool book.  I think it's not really that funny, but it is a hugely creative story.  The book is well-written and is a really quick read.  The basic story is that a dorky teenager swallows a supercomputer that teaches him how to be more cool.  The supercomputer, or "squip", becomes a character of its own.    The book is very imaginative and inventive.  I enjoyed it a lot.  I actually think some of the squip's advice in the book would be very useful to awkward, non-confident teenaged boys (like I used to be!)
