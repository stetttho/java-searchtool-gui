 "Shopgirl" is written by the very well-known comedian Steve Martin.  It is a small story about a wallflower-of-a-girl who sells gloves at Nieman Marcus in LA.    Shopgirl is only 130 pages long.  I finished it on one leg of a long plane ride - and I read pretty slowly.  So it's definitely a quick read, which is a plus.  However, the writing itself is not impressive.  Steve Martin does not have a good flow to his sentences.  Also, the story is also very "blah" and uninspiring.    The complete 180-degree transformation of Jeremy seems highly unrealistic.  This guy goes from 26-year-old slob to GQ-gent nearly overnight.   If this book did not have "by Steve Martin" on it, it would not have been published.  I think people are over-praising it because it's written by a famous comedian, not because it's a great book.  So while I applaud Steve Martin for trying new things, he really should stick to what he's best at - making movies.
