 So yes, he's a Hasidic Jew who makes reggae for the new century.  But once you get past the novelty of it, the music is what must be judged.  The music itself is good straight-ahead reggae.  This may border more on dancehall with a little bit of hip-hop thrown in.  It's not really slow, laid-back like the classic Bob Marley reggae.  My main concern with the album is that it all starts to sound the same after awhile.  Every song has the same tempo, nearly the same flow lyrically, and same instrumentals.  The album lacks a whole lot of memorable choruses to make each song distinguishable from the next.    Overall, it's decent reggae for the new century.  I had a hard time getting through it all in one sitting though.  Matisyahu shows some promise though for a debut album.
