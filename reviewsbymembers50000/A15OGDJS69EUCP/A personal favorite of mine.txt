 This was X-Clan's second, and last, release before disbanding.    X-Clan was a great group for the pro-black, pro-African movement of the early 90's.  I don't think this album at all.  The movement was on its way out when this was released.    Nonetheless, this is a solid album.  It's got great beats.  Brother J has always been a great rapper with great delivery and a conscious message.  Professor X is not as annoying as in the previous album.    Xodus is quite good despite being quite obscure.  Plus it's an odd piece of hip hop history from a past movement.    I would recommend X-Clan's previous To the East, Blackwards first though.
