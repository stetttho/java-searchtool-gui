 The Streets (Mike Skinner) is one of my favorite artists around.  He's very original, hard-to-categorize, and doesn't sound like a lot of other hiphop acts.    This CD is yet another solid album beginning to end.  It's not quite as good as A Grand..., which was a great day-in-the-life-of concept album, but this one's still great.  I could see if you were a die-hard rap fan who only listened to rap, you might not like this guy.  The Streets always covers diverse topics (ie, missing his dead dad); he's one of the 'realest' rappers out there, not afraid to reveal his emotions and personal life.  The beats are actually decent, with more electro influences.  The beats are still simple.  The Streets is definitely not all about great beats; it's always been about Mike's rapping/talking.  Luckily that format hasn't changed at all.  This is a very solid album.  My biggest complaint is that it's too short at 11 songs 37 minutes long.  Recommended to fans of his previous work.
