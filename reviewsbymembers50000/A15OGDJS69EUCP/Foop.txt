 I admit I bought Chris Genoa's "Foop" strictly because I liked Christopher Moore's "Fluke" and "Lamb".  I'm not sure I see the relation to the two after reading "Foop".  I didn't think "Foop" was as laugh-out-loud funny as other reviewers would have you believe.  It is a bizarro science fiction sort of story.  It's also very confusing at times.  Now if that's your cup of tea, cool, you'll love it.    (Side note:  I noted a few spelling errors/grammar mistakes. That sort of thing should not be happening in a published book.)  On the positive side, the book was definitely a memorable read.    The main character Joe is very annoying and a total loser; however, I liked some of the other weirder, unique characters.    Overall, I think "Foop" is a promising debut, but definitely not a 5-star book unless you're really into the sci-fi sort of thing.
