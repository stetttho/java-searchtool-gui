 "The Craft" is Blackalicious' really good, near-perfect follow up to their modern-era classic "Blazing Arrow".     This is very West Coast underground hiphop from the always-solid Solesides/Quannum crew.  You have your tight beats from Chief Xcel.  The great, smart, very unique rapping from Gift of Gab.    The album sounds like it could have been recorded years ago in hiphop's heyday.  But it doesn't sound dated - good beats never go out of style.    There are only a couple songs that sounded average.  Overall, there's a good, tight compact feel to it throughout.  It doesn't jump all over the place like some releases.  Great stuff from a great group!
