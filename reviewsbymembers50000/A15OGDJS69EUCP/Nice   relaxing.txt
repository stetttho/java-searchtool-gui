 Amos Lee's debut is a good solid debut from a very promising artist.  However, it's a little over the top to say it's a five-star bonafide classic release.    Still, it's good.  It's comparable to Norah Jones in terms of pace and laidback mellowness.  It's interesting that this is on Blue Note records because this is decidedly not jazz.  It's more rootsy blues, folk, R&B.    Someone else said that it sounds like he's covering other people's songs, but he's not.  It just has a few places where I think that, "I've heard this song before I think".  So it's warm and comfy and familiar.  Good music - 3.5 (not 5) stars.
