 Yes the Kings of Disco has a great album name going for it first and foremost.  Basically, this is a collection of hard-to-find disco records on the ever-solid K7 label. This double disc is compiled by two world-class DJ's with great musical taste.    The tracks are definitely obscure and most people have never heard of any of the songs or the groups (with the exception of Yazoo maybe).    The music is very grooving and upbeat.  It's good music for fun times.  Good party music to blow through your speakers.  (Find it at the k7 site for a lot cheaper)
