 Mingus Dynasty is a very solid album from Mingus' jazz group's peak years.    The great compositions are very catchy.  Very upbeat and moving.  Very emotional in the playing so that you really feel it.  Mingus' albums seem to have a very electric feel to it.  He always seems lively and spirited, bordering on chaotic at times.  If you're new to jazz or new to Mingus, this is a good place to start, though I'd probably check out Mingus Ah Um first, and maybe this one second.
