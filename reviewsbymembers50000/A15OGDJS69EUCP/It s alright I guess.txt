 I bought this based on the fact that she's John Pizzarelli's wife - which sounded very promising.    Unfortunately, & maybe unfairly, I was hoping for a Pizzarelli-like jazzy performance. This cd is ok - just ok.    It's a little too Broadwayish at times, it's a little too sleep-inducing the other times - yawn. Her voice is alright, nothing too memorable though - there's definitely better singers out there.   Overall I found it very unenthusing - maybe I was in a wrong mood at the time.  This is NOT the female version of John Pizzarelli in case you were wondering; however John does show up on 'We're in the Money'. Sadly though, this cd's just not worth the Money.
