 That's right.  There is a lot of music going on in this album.  This is a collection of live songs done by Tony's group.   The playing is very solid.  Guitar work is superb; the keyboards sound great too when thrown in. The choice of songs is really diverse - maybe a little too diverse as it almost seems all over the board.   The music combines all kinds of genre's thrown together.  So there's some brilliant folk style guitar ala Leo Kottke, there's some rock'n'roll, some bluesy-guitar, and then there's even a touch of what sounds like smooth jazz. I have the impression that this CD will appeal most likely to adult listeners who like to go to their local coffee house and hear live "good music".
