 X-Clan's To the East CD is classic old-school pro-black hip hop.  It's also one of my old favorite CD's from my hip-hop-only teenager days.    The group was pro-black and very militant in their look and attitude.  The militant part doesn't really flow into the songs so  much as the pro-Africanism does.  Brother J is a great frontman; a great mc with a great delivery.   Professor X was the group's version of a more-educated more-pro-black Flava Flav.    X-Clan was never too popular even in their best days, but it was still good stuff.  A personal favorite of mine...this one is better than Xodus, which is still good too.
