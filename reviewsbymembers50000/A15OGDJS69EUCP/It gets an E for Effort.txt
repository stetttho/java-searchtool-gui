 my two cents: To be blunt, most cover/remix albums suck. This one however is listenable. If you're a fan of electronic music/DJ mixing (ala DJ Z-Trip), you may find SOME of this collection interesting. It is interesting to hear electronic modern beats added to classic songs. It is too bad though that it's really a hit or miss cd.  The hitting: In particular, I've never heard Aaron Neville's Hercules (#2) before so I'm not sure what the original sounds like, but the Beatless mix is very funky & grooving. Track 3 is a remix of the Doors' Riders on the Storm and it's still a very cool, dark track with the new mix. Track 7 is Gotan Project's remix of Chet Baker performing Thelonious Monk's beautiful classic song Round Bout Midnight; comes complete with some very cool Tango-style instruments. The missing: #4 is a Rockers Hi-Fi mix of Ella Fitzgerald covering Cream's Sunshine of Your Love; it's very slow and too dub-heavy for me. Track 10 features a dub-reggae version of Billie Jean by Shinehead which is very strange, very slow, not my cup of tea. A lot of the other tracks didn't do too much for me - not very memorable; maybe because I'm not familiar with the original tunes (?), thus falling somewhere in the middle of good & terrible.  Overall the beats add a different atmosphere to all the songs. The songs never really sound out-dated at all.  Overall a fair effort.  I would not warrant a full-priced purchase; maybe a used-price purchase if you can find it.
