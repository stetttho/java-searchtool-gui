 I was really pleasantly surprised when I found this used and bought it on a whim.  First, it contains the world-popular "Dragostea Din Tei" aka Maia Hee...    This is a good time, party-time CD.  This is a lot of fun.  Every song is a winner.  Very upbeat.    There's enough variety between the songs so it doesn't sound too repetitive.  Also, most of the songs are short so there's usually a fresh, new song every three/four minutes.    Highly recommended!
