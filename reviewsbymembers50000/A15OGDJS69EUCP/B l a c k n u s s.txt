 A fairly good 1972 release from Rahsaan, master of reeds.  This album has a very soul/r&b-based sound which is played with great fire and emotion.  The first half is stellar, but the second half has a few really bad songs which dampens my enthusiasm.   Rahsaan sounds amazing at one point in 'Old Rugged Cross' where he's playing two or three horns at the time without any pauses.  It's the only instance of I've ever heard of; definitely a unique person. Overall very good and recommended for your more R&B funk jazz fan.
