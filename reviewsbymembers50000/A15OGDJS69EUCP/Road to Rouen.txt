 Supergrass' "Road to Rouen" snuck out late last year with little to no warning or fanfare.  I'm lucky I found it!  I've been a big Supergrass fan for awhile.  So it's nice to see the band "grow up" and mature on this record.  The overall sound on this album is a lot fuller than their previous work.    Road to Rouen feels like one of those 70's concept/art albums.  It has a great, solid feel and atmosphere throughout.  It doesn't get too young/goofy/corny like they've been know to do in the past (which may or may not be a good thing).  Either way, I think it's a great album.  It is only 9 songs long, about 33 minutes long, which is one complaint.  It's still worth picking up.
