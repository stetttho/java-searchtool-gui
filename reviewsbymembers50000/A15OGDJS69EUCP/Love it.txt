 I received the Braun 8595 for Christmas (thanks mom!) and love it.    I had a Norelco before which irritated my neck badly.  The Braun does not irritate my neck, though it doesn't always cut all the neck hairs on the first run over them.  The Braun is sleek, solid, feels good to hold, and looks very European.  The motor on this razor feels very strong, but not too strong where you should fear for your skin.  None of the other reviews mention that this razor has a third setting where you can put up a little blade. This is useful for evening out your sideburns and making them nice and straight.  It's also good for trimming the fine hairs that may grow on your earlobes.  I guess you could conceivably shave your head using the little clipper but it would take forever.  My main problem is buying the replacement cleaning cartridges.  And as stated before, some of the hairs do not always get collected in the razor and will fall out on the basin.  Overall though, the Braun 8595 gives a very comfortable shave.  Highly recommended.
