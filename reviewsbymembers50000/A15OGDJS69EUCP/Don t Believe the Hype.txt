 my two cents:  I saw this album listed as one of Spin's top 40 albums of the year.  Usually I find Spin's opinion to be pretty good so I figured I'd pick this one up. Also, there is a fantastic version of Seed on the Roots new Phrenology album (highly recommended). So needless to say, I was hoping for a good album...and what I got was not. I'm not sure what all the five-star album hype is about. One glaring problem is that there is a whole lot of filler on the two discs. I can see why record companies would not have wanted to put this out as-is on their labels. Here and there, every four tracks, you do find a good promising song complete with verses and choruses, however that is very few and far between. On the positive side though, I will say that Cody definitely shows promise. Had this been pared down into say 40 minutes of tracks, it might be better. Overall I'd say don't believe the hype on this one. But watch out when his next album drops...
