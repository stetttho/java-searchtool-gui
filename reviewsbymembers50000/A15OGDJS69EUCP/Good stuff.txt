 (This guy is like a machine - it seems like a new Pizzarelli CD is always coming out!) So it's yet another solid release from the hip jazz guitarist singer.  This time though, he's doing the bossa nova.   It seems strange that Pizzarelli's never done this genre before, because it works out so well.  He's the perfect laid-back mellow guy for the music.  So, as usual, another solid cd beginning to end.  Actually, this album is one of his more enjoyable ones because of the new style and great source material.
