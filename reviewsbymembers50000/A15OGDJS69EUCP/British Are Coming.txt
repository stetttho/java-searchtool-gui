 This is more of an overall review, as I bought both Volume 1 and Volume 2 separately.  Volume 2 is much, much better (4 stars).  Vol. 2 has better songs and is definitely worth the price.  Vol. 1, though, is not worth the price (2 stars).    I personally think they should have taken the best songs from both and crammed a full 70+ minutes onto one disc.  Then it would've been a five-star CD!  Or you could buy Volume 2 and a Best of the Kinks and you'd be set!
