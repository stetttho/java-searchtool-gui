 Buying Party Central is definitely better than buying all of the individual albums themselves.  You are getting the best (oftentimes the only) good song of an old album.  In that regards, Party Central is a good bargain.  However, as an mix album, I found it hard to listen to it straight-through.  After awhile, the amusement wore off and I found it annoying.  Maybe it's the sequencing of the tracks?  Either way, it's a good compilation as far as invidual songs go.  But for a mix cd flow-wise, I didn't dig it.
