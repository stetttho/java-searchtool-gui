 This is a really cool laidback remix project from Everything But The Girl.  I, unlike a lot of reviewers, did not own any previous albums of theirs.  I basically knew EBTG from the song 'Missing' which is an absolutely beautiful classic song.  That said, the rest of the album is somewhere in the middle of downbeat/ dance/ house music.  It showcases the lead singer's great sexy smooth voice - she's better than Dido!  The songs don't sound as if they've been done over a 10 year period - they all sound pretty modern.  They definitely don't sound too dated.  Overall, this is great stuff even if you're not familiar with original CD's.  Good late-night listening.
