 In a word..sellout.  I had the misfortune of paying a fair amount of money to see her in concert a few month's ago. I now assume the concert was to promote this new album.  She's apparently SOLD OUT and tried to cross over.  Some guy in tight leather pants and a alto/soprano stage cavorting on stage?  Come on!  Apparently the new age (small jazz influences) weren't selling enough records, so she had to sell out and make more $$$ for her record company.  Horrible.  Don't support this rubbish.  Save your money.
