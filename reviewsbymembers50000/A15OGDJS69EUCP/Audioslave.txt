 If you're a fan of Chris Cornell and Soundgarden, I can imagine you'll love Audioslave's newest CD "Out of Exile".   If you were a huge fan of the hip-hop meets hard-rock band Rage Against the Machine, you may not really like this album.    I was sort of so-so on this new Audioslave cd.  Nothing really stood out and struck me aside the head and made me take attention.  It's good straight ahead rock, but it left me wanting something more.  Also, Tom Morello sounds horribly out of place solo'ing on a lot of the songs.  This album now sounds like it is truly Chris Cornell's band, not really Rage meets Chris Cornell.    Many people may like Audioslave and I can understand why, but for me, this was just alright.  2.5 stars.
