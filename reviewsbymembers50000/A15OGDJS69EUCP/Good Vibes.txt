 This CD is short and to the point at only ten songs long.  But overall I'd say it's worth the cheaper price.  This is all you really need if you're just a casual Roy Ayers fan or want a good overview of his best stuff for a good price.    The CD has lots of funky, jazzy, R&B from the 70s.  This is defining music for that time period in terms of where jazz had headed by then.  Jazz had "souled" out - or sold out depending on how you look at it.  Also Roy's music has been sampled to death by hip-hop acts, most notably by A Tribe Called Quest.  Overall, it's good grooving stuff most of the time, with a hint of 70's cheesiness thrown in every once in a while.  A good cd for what it is.
