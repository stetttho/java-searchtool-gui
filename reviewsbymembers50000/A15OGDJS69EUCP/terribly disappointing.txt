 If you liked ANY of Alvin Youngblood Hart's other cd's, I can almost guarantee you will NOT like this one. It's garbage. It's a poor crossover/sellout effort. Thankfully though he went back to acoustic roots music with his most recent release. Pick up anything else by Alvin - his other three cd's are wonderful music.  We'll just pretend this release never happened....
