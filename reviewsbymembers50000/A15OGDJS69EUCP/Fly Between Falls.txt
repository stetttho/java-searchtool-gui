 ALO, or Animal Liberation Orchestra, sound like a bunch of hippies.  These hippies are totally cool!  This is a surprisingly good CD.  It's a re-release now on Jack Johnson's Brushfire label, so you know it's good.  Jack even guests on the second track.  The music is very chill and laidback, but a little more uptempo than Jack Johnson.  It has a little funky groove to it.  Although it does have some rather stupid lyrics at times, the music more than makes up for it.  This is a really cool cd, perfect for hanging out.  Recommended.
