 I'll agree with a lot of the other reviewers here in saying that the music is great and Lady Day is classic in her own right, but this cd sucks for audio quality.  What day and age are we living in when this is the best they can put on a CD?    Overall very disappointing.  There are other much better quality recordings out there of Lady Day.  This one's not even worth the discounted price.
