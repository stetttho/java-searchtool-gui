 With all respect for Wilson Pickett, the guys in the Commitments should have been striving to sound like Magic Sam.    This is some really great SOUL music; you can hear it in his voice and just feeeeel it coming through the speakers.    There's an early version of the Blues Brothers' classic "Sweet Home Chicago" which most people should be familiar with.    This really is a five-star record, and I'm not a fan of giving out five-stars willy-nilly like a lot of people on Amazon.  It's too bad Magic Sam's not as well known as some of the other great soul singers such as Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding; this one is just as good as any of the topnotch material....And it's (relatively) cheap!  Do your CD collection a favor and buy it now.
