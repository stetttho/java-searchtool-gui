 This is just some downright seriously good piano/bass/drum trio work from bop pianist Sonny Clark.  The trio sounds bigger than just three members as it's good bop for the most part.  It kind of tails off a bit on the last two songs but still overall this is very good. It's high-quality straight-up jazz.  Recommended for piano & bop jazz fans.   People new to jazz may want to start with Sonny Clark's "Cool Struttin'" release first.
