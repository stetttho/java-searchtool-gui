 Markus Schulz's newest release "Without You Near" leaves me with mixed feelings.  I can understand the wide range of reviews here on Amazon.  I'm sort of neutral to the whole album.    I enjoyed the slower beats on the cd, but that's not what I was expecting to get.  Actually some of the actual music on the album is quite majestic, moving and sweeping.  It's that sort of epic dreamy dance that sounds so beautiful.    If the whole album were like that with minimal vocalists, I'd love it.  However, the other reviewers are correct:  there does seem to be too many vocals.  Markus' music is strong enough to where he doesn't need that many vocals.    He's a tremendous producer and the music on here shows it.  The vocals were ok for me (I can't say I disliked them, but I definitely did not love them).  So overall a three-star release.  Maybe worth a Used purchase but definitely not the full retail.
