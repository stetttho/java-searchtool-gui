 This is the first I'd heard of Bireli Lagrene.  Very good Gipsy King-esque guitar playing, only more authentic French jazz club-feeling.  The faster songs really move and sound great.  My chief complaint would be that there seems to be a lot of slower songs which don't do a whole lot.  They're pretty; the violin playing is beautiful; but they're not too memorable. Still, if you're like me and you're a fan of the Gipsy Kings and that kind of music, or a fan of gipsy jazz, this isn't a bad disc.
