 My first thought after hearing this cd was that this is the kind of music that Carlos Santana should be making nowadays, instead of working with Rob Thomas and Michelle Branch and whoever else happens to be popular and trendy at the time. Another thought I had is that this is a horrible name for a band.  It sounds corny and it sounds too close to Los Lobos.  It's almost embarassing to tell your friends that you're listening to a band named "Los Lonely Boys".   But it's really hard to dislike this cd, so I would recommend it.  It's really quite catchy, without selling out.  A fair amount of rock; good songs; good harmonies; I like the Spanish influences throughout. Overall a very promising debut.
