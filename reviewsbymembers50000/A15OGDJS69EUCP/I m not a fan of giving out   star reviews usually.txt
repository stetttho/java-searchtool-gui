 I'm not a fan of giving out 5-star reviews usually.....but Begonias is a fabulous cd.  This is more of a Thad Cockrell album than a Caitlin Cary album.  Thad takes the lead on most of the vocals, with Caitlin lending support.  They sound wonderful together.  The music itself is very engaging.  This isn't the usual country-pop music, which is mainly played on the radio nowadays.  Begonias sounds like it could have been recorded in the golden age of country, back in the 50's or 60's.  It has a vintage feeling to it.  Go buy this album and support great music.  It's worth the full retail price.    Begonias is about as authentic and as American as good music can be.  One of my favorite records of the year.
