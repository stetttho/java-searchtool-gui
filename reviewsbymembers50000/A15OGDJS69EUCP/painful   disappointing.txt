 my two cents:  I've been a Steve Earle fan for a couple years now, having gotten into him big-time on the 5-star The Mountain (extremely recommended). Then came the 4 (or 5?) star Transcendental Blues. The few albums before that (El Corazon, I Feel Alright and Train a'Comin are all sold 3 or 4 star albums too). So needless to say when release date came for the new Jerusalem I rushed out to buy it.  I about jumped out of my seat immediately as the opening part of track 1 Ashes to Ashes is in some almost-satanic husky voice that just weirded me out. The song's actually good other than that, but that awful, awful demonic "ashes to ashes / dust to dust" voice left me shocked at how such a terrible thing could show up on a Steve Earle album. I found the chorus on track 3 Conspiracy Theory to be painful to listen to. Again the song's not bad other than that particularly painful part. Now, everyone is all ga-ga over the John Walkers Blues lyrics, but I personally didn't care that much for the song itself.  Without the "offensive"/controversial/etc lyrics, the song would be very blah.  On The Truth, track 7, I'm not sure what he's going for with his voice/singing.  Lyrically, maybe he's trying to do his own Public Enemy "Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos" (?). Musically though I'm not digging this one at all. I do like track 5 The Kind & track 6 What's a Simple Man to Do; maybe because it reminds me alot of previous Steve Earle albums, and it's disappointing that the whole album doesn't sound this good. The other songs on the album are basically forgettable ( track 12, Jerusalem's alright though).   I think's it a good thing that Steve Earle is getting some press-time nowadays because maybe people will discover him like I did.  Unfortunately they'll discover him based on this album, which is not a good place to start. I'd try one of the aforementioned albums for a much better representation of Earle's work.
