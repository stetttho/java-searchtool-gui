 Easily the worst of the Jazzmatazz projects.  Doesn't even really sound like Jazz at all, anywhere.  It's more an R&B Neo-soul project.    Now if you're into that kind of thing, it's probably a good album.  I found a few songs to be good but overall it's just too much of a departure from the whole concept of Jazz-meets-HipHop for me.
