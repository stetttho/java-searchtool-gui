 Picked this up based on a recommendation from an ex-g/f and the hype. Upon your first listen (or two) it's alot different than all american hiphop. It's definitely different (hopefully you don't mind trying something different).  If so, buy it. It grows on you a lot.  Beats are pretty good.  The songs do have decent choruses which helps digest it easier.  His flow is quite bad but you do get used to it.  Lyrics are tremendously entertaining. Lots of cool slang to pick up on (use of the word Geezer a lot). The guy even drops a "gran turismo" reference in "the Irony of it all".   I can't think of anything like "If you like **Insert CD Name Here** then you'll like the Streets" - it's that off-the-norm.  Maybe the closest is "If you liked the quirkiness and uptemponess of movies like Snatch, Lock Stock & Trainspotting, you might like this cd."  In fact the pro-beer-drinking guy on "the Irony of it all" reminds me a lot of Begbie from Trainspotting.... Go buy it.  You'll like it - but maybe not so at first.  Plus you'll get strange looks, like "what the heck is thaaaat?"
