 Jazzanova could make some guy in lederhosen yodeling into something smooth, jazzy, headnodding, and downright sweet.... they've got good taste in music as is evidenced on this album.   This album has enough electronica/downbeat/chill "neu-jazz" (or whatever you want to call it) for those types of ears, and enough straight jazz for the more traditional jazz types. I'll reiterate another reviewer's recommendation - Victor Davies self-titled and remixed albums are both highly recommended - he's featured on the opener.  Koop is also featured prominently with two songs - again highly recommended. I'm particulary intrigued by some of the highly hard-to-find Eastern Germany /Polish/Czech vintage 70s jazz that's available on this release - it's definitely an area I would not have considered for jazz back then.  Overall, top notch stuff - 4 stars - (No 5 stars as it's not ground-breaking but it is solid).  Recommended.
