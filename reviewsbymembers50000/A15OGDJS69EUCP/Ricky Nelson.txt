 This "Greatest Hits" really is theee definitive collection.  It has 25 songs on one CD;  Amazon's sale price is a relative bargain for that many songs.  This version of the "Greatest Hits" is much more comprehensive than the Millenium Collection, which was really cheap and lightweight at only 12 songs.  This CD covers all of his biggest songs up to 1972's "Garden Party", which was his last big hit.  While 25 songs may seem a bit overwhelming, the songs are short and all were very catchy.  These are good songs that represent an era that has faded into the past - good, wholesome, rockabilly music.  Good stuff!
