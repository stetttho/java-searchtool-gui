 Yoruba Sessions is a remix project by Osunlade on the always-solid K7 label.  It features dancey vocal songs remixed.    The cd reminds me of Victor Davies' self-titled record, which is highly recommended.  Osunlade has good upbeat beats galore.  It features an almost a Brazilian/electronica flavor to it.  It's overall good stuff that'll make you happy when you pop it in the cd player.
