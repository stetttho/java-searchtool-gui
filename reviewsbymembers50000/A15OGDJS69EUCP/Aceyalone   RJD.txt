 Aceyalone has let me down a lot recently in terms of releases.  He hasn't had a consistently good album for quite awhile.    I loved him about ten years ago, but he's slowly slipped since.  Given that, I only picked "Magnificent City" because it was produced by RJD2.  RJD2's beats are pretty good throughout this album, as you would expect.  Aceyalone seems to have aged a bit and isn't quite as on-point as he used to be.  There are some really stellar songs on here, but then there are some so-so songs.  It's about 50-50 in terms of good vs. average.    For example, the album starts out really strong with the first two songs, but then drops at the next two songs.  So I found it inconsistent.    "Magnificent City" could have easily been a 5-star classic, but it came up a little short.  3.5 stars.
