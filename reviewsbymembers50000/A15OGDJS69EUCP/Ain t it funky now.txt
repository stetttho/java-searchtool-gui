 Breakestra's "Hit The Floor" does indeed sound straight out of 1972.  This is highly recommended to fans of funk, R&B, jazz, hip-hop, and anyone who likes good music.    The songs lyrically are just alright themselves; they're not exactly blazing the lyrical trail here.  However, the music, especially the drumming, is fantastic.  "Hit the Floor" is in the same vein of Medeski Martin & Wood, Stanton Moore/Galactic, Charlie Hunter, and Grant Green's funkier stuff.  It also features Jurassic 5 in a song, which was my favorite song on the album.  I would love to see Breakestra do an entire album as Jurassic 5's backing band.  Good stuff.  Recommended!  (I imagine these guys are an incredibly good time live.)
