 Hands down my favorite album ever. I've had this cd since it came out and I was 13 or 14. Repeated listening is a must. Lyrically amazing. Hip hop meets jazz beats - come on, who else has ever used bass legend Ron Carter on an album.  The interplay between Phife and Qtip is perfect.  'Scenario' is probably the best posse song ever.  People's Instinctive was a good album, Midnight Marauders is really good too, but they're not as perfect as Low End Theory...My personal quintessential hip-hop album ever (yes, Ever!)
