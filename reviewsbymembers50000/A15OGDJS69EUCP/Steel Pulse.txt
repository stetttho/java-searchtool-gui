 Steel Pulse "Ultimate Collection" is a very nice collection of the group's best work on Island in their early years.  This is reggae from that classic late 70's period.  A lot of the music from that timeframe is pretty good stuff across the board.  Steel Pulse is no exception.  It's very relaxing, even when it's sometimes politcal in its message.  The CD is missing a few good songs from when they switched labels in the early 80's though.    I would recommend this to fans of Bob Marley and Peter Tosh.  It's in that similar style of reggae.    Good music for calming down to.
