 A 5-star desert island disc from an "electronic" dj album? How is that possible? Well, it's a beautiful album, almost a work of art.  And it's amazing listening to this today (midway thru 2003) how good this still sounds, some 7(!) years later. I've owned it since probably 1996 and somehow it's a timeless classic disc that is still primed for repeat latenight listening. Very highly recommended.
