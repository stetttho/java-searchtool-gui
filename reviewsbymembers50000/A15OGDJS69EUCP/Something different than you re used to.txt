 Ed Mott'a Poptical is a funky soulful Brasilia jazzy record.  This is some good music coming from a balding middle-aged Brazilian soul singer.   It does sound like a Steely Dan record in terms of backing music, which is great if that's your thing.  Ed posesses a soulful singing good voice, nothing too overpowering but still pleasing on the ears.  Portuguese is a pretty language to listen to being sung.  The only drawback is that some of the slower songs drag a little bit.  However, overall I would say it's an enjoyable album though.  3.5 stars.
