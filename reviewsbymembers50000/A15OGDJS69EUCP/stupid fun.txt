 my two cents:  "rooty" is completely cheesy at times and the lyrics/voices are typical dance-music voices with nothing lyrically to say which is usually a recipe for me hating it. but for some odd reason i can't say anything bad about the album. it's really good corny fun, a good cd to throw to make you feel happy, it just makes you want to bounce your head (& bottom-half) around.
