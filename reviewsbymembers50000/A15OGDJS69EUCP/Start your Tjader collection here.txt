 This was the first Cal Tjader cd/album I bought. I think my Uncle recommended it from when he was a kid (he's got good taste). All of Tjader's music is very easy to listen to, very rhythmic, very hip, very chic. A friend, though, did say that he only likes Tjader in small doses (maybe he doesn't care for the vibes or maybe thinks it's too lounge-y). Regardless, Tjader is in fine form here on this mid-60s session. This is a popular album and is a good place to start for people who do not own any Cal Tjader cd's. Buy Soul Sauce first, then try out others if you like it.
