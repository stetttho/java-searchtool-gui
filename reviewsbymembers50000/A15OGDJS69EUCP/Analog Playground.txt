 Songs from the Analog Playground is one of the better modern jazz albums I've heard.    It features a few solid guest vocalists along with some great playing by Charlie Hunter and his band.  Each of the guest vocalists bring a uniqueness with them and they make their song special.    The vocalists help keep the album from getting too repetitive and boring.  Norah Jones, Kurt Elling, Mos Def and the lead vocalist from the band Galactic do about two songs each.  There are also some straight-ahead instrumentals.  The entire cd is filled with very good music.  It's very laidback, jazzy and grooving.  I would recommend this Cd, even to people who are on the fringe of being jazzheads because it has that universal musical appeal.  Good stuff!
