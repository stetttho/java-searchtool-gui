 I found Les McCann's "Comment" to be a rather weak release from the  very talented pianist.  "Comment" is decent soul jazz and it features a lot of singing on the tracks. However, this one plays out more like a bad R&B album, rather than a jazz album.    Also, it's a little too slow for my taste.  So if you're looking for something along the lines of his fantastic "Swiss Movement" album and other hard-driving soul-jazz, this isn't it.    "Comment" has not aged nicely over the years.
