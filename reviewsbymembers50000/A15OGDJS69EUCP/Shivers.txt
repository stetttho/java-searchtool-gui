 Armin Van Buuren is a top-notch DJ and this album features his own work.  Normally, Armin's mixing the work of other artists, but on 'Shivers' it's all about Armin.  The CD is pretty good trance/ upbeat dance music.  There is a nice variety of vocalists on the album.  The songs seem to drag on for a little too long though.    It is difficult to describe, but it feels like this CD is missing a special something to make it really stand out.  There definitely are better trance/ dance albums out there than 'Shivers'.    I would say it's worth a Used purchase at best.
