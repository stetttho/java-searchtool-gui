 Sasha's "Fundacion NY" is a decent follow-up to the wonderfully fabulous "Involver".    Fundacion is much more of an ambient background mix.  It has darker tones.  It's definitely not really upbeat dance/trance at all so do not expect that.  It's more of an cool, neat atmosphere disc.  I loved the inclusion of Playgroup's remake of Depeche Mode's "Behind the Wheel". But that was already readily available on Playgroup's DJ Kicks cd I think.  The mixing, as another reviewer noted, is superb and the songs do flow seemlessly together.    So, overall it's good.  Just good, not great.  I wouldn't pay the full-on retail price though, but definitely it's worth a used cd purchase.    As a side note, the cardboard packaging is terrible, as it is difficult to slide the cd easily in and out.  I've already scratched my cd after two listens causing a skip in track 16.
