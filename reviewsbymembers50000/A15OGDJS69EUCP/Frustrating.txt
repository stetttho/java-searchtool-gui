 If you're a Simpsons fan, you'll obviously like the game because, hey, it's the Simpsons.  You can't go wrong with that.  If you're not a fan though, you probably won't be reading this anyways... SO yes it's cool because it's the Simpsons and there are actual missions on this game.  Missions are actually ok; there is some flexibility in being able to skip them; some flexibility as to which character you are.  All of these are good things.   The chief complaint I have is that this game is too hard (or maybe I just suck really badly). Missions are beatable but they take forever. My friend and I took turns getting frustrated and passing the controller to each other. A Beginner/Easy Skill Level would have been nice. So it's frustratingly difficult which really takes away from the fun of it all.  I wouldn't buy it for that reason - rent it and see how you do at it (or in my case, don't do at it) first.
