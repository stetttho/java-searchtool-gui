 Erlend Oye takes a somewhat-big departure from the Kings of Convenience "Quiet is the new Loud" album.  His "Unrest" album is a lot closer to the feel of the KofC "Versus" remix album. Still, he's got a great voice.  This is blippy synthpop electronica music with him on the top.  So it's quite cool.  Quite different than a lot of music available today.   Pick it up if you want to try some different music out.
