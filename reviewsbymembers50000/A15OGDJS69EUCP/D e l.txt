 I remember around 1991, NBA Inside Stuff did a feature on B.J. Armstrong (my favorite player) of the Chicago Bulls.  B.J. said that his favorite song was "Mr. Dobalina".  I remember thinking, well, if B.J. Armstrong likes this guy named Del tha Funkee Homosapien, then he must be good.    And yes, Del's first album "I Wish My Brother George Was Here" is an absolute hands-down hip-hop classic.  So I recommend that album over this one (it's cheap too).  Del was at his creative peak with that first album;  it featured great production from Ice Cube (back when Ice Cube made good albums instead of movies).    Since then, his career's been a mixed bag.  His CD's are very inconsistent.  A Best Of CD is probably a good way to get an overview of those mixed-result cd's.    But I think you'd also be better off buying "Deltron 3030" and "I Wish My Brother George..." instead.
