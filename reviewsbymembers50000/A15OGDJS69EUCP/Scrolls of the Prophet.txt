 "Scrolls of the Prophet" is the Best of Peter Tosh.  This is really all that you need if you are a normal fan or are interested in Tosh.  It is a good intro to his career.  You may want to purchase more of his individual albums after hearing this CD.  This best of Tosh CD starts out basically where Bob Marley left off.  If you are a fan of Bob Marley's "Legend", or if you're a fan of good reggae, this would be a good purchase.  Highly recommended.
