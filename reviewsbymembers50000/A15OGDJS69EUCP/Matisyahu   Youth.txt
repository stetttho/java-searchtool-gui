 I was pleasantly surprised after my first listen to Matisyahu's "Youth" album.  It is a significant step-up from his previous "Live at Stubbs" album, which was really repetitive and hard to make it through.  "Youth" however, has a good mixture of songs.  There are enough faster/upbeat songs to offset the slower/chill songs.  Also, Matisyahu doesn't stick to the same dancehall singing/ rapping/ talking throughout the entire album.  There's a little bit of real singing in there and it's a nice change!  The album really is helped out by producer Bill Laswell, who has worked with a very diverse group of musicians.  The backing music on the album is much richer and broader than the live album.  "Youth" is a really good album.  By know, everyone is a fan of "King Without a Crown" but there are definitely a lot of other good songs on there.  Definitely recommended.
