 I'm not sure what it is that made me cringe upon listening to this cd - wait probably the voice. Just couldnt get into the music at all - bad music, awful voice, bad lyrics. Which is odd since I like most of the other similar related bands - buy those instead: White stripes, vines, D4 are all much much better.  Don't believe the hype on this one - I'd rather drive a junked old Datsun than listen to the Datsuns.
