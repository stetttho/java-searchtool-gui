 First off, "Carolina" is a really cool, fresh sound.    If you're like me, you came to find Seu Jorge on the Life Aquatic movie.  Life Aquatic featured him in a slower, stripped-down acoustic format.   "Carolina", however, features upbeat, moving, happy songs.  Lots of very danceable songs.  He has such a great voice that you forget that it's all sung in Portuguese.    If you search around hard enough, you can probably find it somewhere else cheaper though.  It's worth the import price though.  It's definitely highly recommended for fans of samba, world music, and just different/unique/cool music in general.
