 "The Hummingbird's Daughter" by Luis Alberto Urrea is one of the best books I have ever read.  Period.  And I'm not even in Urrea's target demographic!  Nonetheless, I absolutely loved it.  Without divulging too much of the plot, the story follows Teresita Urrea, a distant relative of the author's from the late 1800's, as she transforms from a poor indian in Mexico to a quasi-saint.    Urrea's writing is fantastic.  He paints a great story and landscape of the old west.  The pace is good, quick-moving, and never stalls.  The character development is extraordinary; there are some truly unforgettable people in this tale.    Overall, in a word, this book is "magical".  It is truly a great story.  I cannot recommend this book enough.
