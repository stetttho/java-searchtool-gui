 Another CD of more of the same from Me First, which really isn't a bad thing. A powerpacked half hour for you to wake up to, for you to drive fast to, for you to scream along the words to. Ok so it's r&b covers mostly, but these are all songs I'd heard of - so you may know only the chorus but still that's better than nothing - I can imagine this wouldnt be as good an album if you weren't familiar with the original songs (like say Mona Lisa / Nat King Cole). Still it's a fun cd - rock out!
