 This is actually one of the first CD's I ever owned so it holds a special place in my heart... That said, this has actually held up pretty well over the years. It's their second release; features a great combination of dance music, r&b, and even a little jazz.  It's got a great vibe from start to finish; very solid throughout.  Very head-nod-friendly. Good stuff.  It's too bad this band basically fell off the face of the earth after this release.
