 I'm going to have to say overall, on this double-disc from Sander & Lee, I am disappointed.    Now I absolutely loved both of his previous "This is Everybody" releases.  Those two sets gave me over 4+ hours of great music!  For some reason though, this "On Tour" one doesn't do anything for me.  The excitement and energy seem to be zapped out of it.  The track selections just aren't that great.  It's not like it's awful or painful to listen to; it's just not that interesting.  I had a hard time sitting through all of it at once.  It's a big letdown from what I had expected/hoped for.  I'm still fairly hopeful that This is Everybody 3 will return Sander to his top-notch form.  If you're a serious Sander collector, wait for the used copies to start popping up on this one.
