 "Copperopolis" by Charlie Hunter is yet another good solid outing from the jazz guitarist's trio.    The music here is very hip and cool.  The music is upbeat for the most part.  It's good driving jazz.  Charlie Hunter sounds like the Jimi Hendrix of jazz guitar at times.  The amount of sounds that the trio produces is very impressive.    Overall it's really good music.  There are only a few songs that don't work for me.    Charlie Hunter consistently puts out good (occasionally great) albums.  This one's good.
