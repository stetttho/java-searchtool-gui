 "Shifting Gears" is a decent, good, not great, release from the extremely talented DJ Z-Trip.  Z-Trip was the king of the mashup before it became the trendy hip, cool thing to do.  "Uneasy Listening" is a classic, if you can somehow locate it.  "Shifting Gears" is more of a regular producer album with a bunch of guest MC's.  It's very similar to DJ Babu of Dilated Peoples cd.  It's very up and down: some MC's are good, some not so good.  I guess it depends on which rappers you like/dislike; that may affect your opinion a lot.  Luckily, the last song Revolution features his classic mashup mixing.  His ability to blend two completely irrelevant records together into something tight is amazing.    I think it's too bad the whole album wasn't mostly instrumentals with a few vocalists scattered throughout.  Instead it's a mostly average guest-MC-vocal album with a few fantastic instrumentals thrown about.  Three stars.  It's reasonably priced too, which is great!
