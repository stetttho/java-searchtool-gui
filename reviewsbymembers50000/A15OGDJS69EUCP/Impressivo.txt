 This is my first Roger Clyne cd but it's really really good music.  This is about as American straight-up rock-n-roll as it gets nowadays.   At times, this album sounds like the great rock of the 80's if it were being done today. It's almost as if Bon Jovi (back when they were good) moved to Arizona/Mexico and jumped forward 20 years into the future and made this rockin album. Support good music - Buy it!
