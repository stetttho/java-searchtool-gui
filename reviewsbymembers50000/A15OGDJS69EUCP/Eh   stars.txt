 I own a couple LTJ Bukem cd's so bought this one on name alone. Granted this isn't a collection of HIS songs but the styles on this album are very similar to his stuff and he seems to have exquisite taste.  So it's a good cd overall, but just nothing to get terribly excited about - he's done better before. Still, it's good background/chillout/late night listening music.  Overall though, 3 stars which is still better than most "electronica" cds out there.   Check out Journey Inward if you're interested in a good preview of his work...
