 I bought ATB's Seven Years basically because I knew 9:00 (Til I Come) and had heard his name as being highly regarded in the trance/dance genre.  So I didn't know a lot about him going in.  After a couple listens though, I have to say, this is a really good CD.  It's very upbeat and the beats are top notch.  The textures to his music create a very warm sound.  It doesn't sound too synthesized.  During one of the slower songs, it kind of reminded me of Robert Miles' classic "The Children".    Another thing is that this music has been recorded over 7 years since 1998, but you really wouldn't know it.  If you told me this was all brand new music, I'd probably believe it.  ATB's music has definitely aged nicely over these last 7 years.  Recommended!
