 I found this used at a local record store and bought it for about 7 bucks.  That's a fair price for this relatively-short CD.    Essential Dion is a good, basic best-of CD.  Buy it if you don't own any of Dion's music and just want to get all of his big, best-known songs.    I know there are more comprehensive collections out there, but for the low price, this is probably all you need.
