 ...Slaid Cleaves "Broke Down" is such a good record!  Slaid is in the vein of many a folk singer-songwriter, but this album stands out from the rest.  Slaid writes and sings songs that are very descriptive; it's like a story being told in front of you.  The music is very laid back and mellow with lots of acoustic guitar.  Also, it's solid throughout start to finish, no duds in there.   Superb stuff.
