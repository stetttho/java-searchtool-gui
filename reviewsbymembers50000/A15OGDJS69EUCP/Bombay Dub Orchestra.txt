 "Bombay Dub Orchestra" had me hooked on the name alone.  The music on the double disc does not really qualify as "dub". It does not even qualify in the general "electronica" label.  It is surprisingly beautiful with the use of the string section. The limited vocals are beautiful too. The beats are not that overpowering; they are blended in nicely.  Overall, this is a huge sonic landscape. The layers of music are great.  The second disc sounds different enough from the first that it is almost like getting two discs of new material.  The music is very soothing, bordering on Enya/Enigma New Age.  It seems like it'd be easy to put this on and calm down to, or fall asleep to.  This is why I give it 3 stars.  It wasn't really "dub" enough, not head-nod-able, not electronica/chillout enough for me.  It is a beautiful album if you're into slower, world, New Age, cool music.
