 Attention, cd buyers, there's a "New Danger" in the world today:  once-great MC's making horrible albums.  I wanted to like Mos Def's album The New Danger.  I really did.  He was great in Black Star, great in his debut Black on Both Sides, and generally great on his guest appearances on other songs.  However, this New Danger is a colossal failure.  Half of the songs are not even songs at all.  Most of the album is just Mos Def talking/ trying to sing over a good beat.  The songs generally go nowhere.    This album is 100% pure ego.  It is Mos Def trying to make an epic album to span all of musickind.   Hands down, this is one of the most annoying, disappointing, irritating albums I have ever heard - and I've heard a LOT of CD's in my time.    Please don't believe any of these five star "absolute classic" reviews.
