 Wow, Common's "Be" is such a monumental comeback after "Electric Circus".  For as much as "Electric Circus" sucked, that's how good "Be" is.  This is truly a four or five star album.  This is Common back at what he does best.  Dusty, authentic, scratchy, old 70's R&B/Jazz samples with straight-ahead rapping.  Tremendous production from Kanye West gives us some of the best beats heard on a newer hip hop album.  This has a great atmosphere to it, a tight compact theme.  This is taking hip hop back a few years, but that's fine because there hasn't been a whole lot of outstanding hip hop in the last few years.  This one sounds like it'll age nicely.  Highly recommended.
