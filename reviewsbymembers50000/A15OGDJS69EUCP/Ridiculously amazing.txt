 I don't remember how I found this one but the album sounds like it's made 100 years from now in the future... Sounds straight out of your idea of what music will sound like when everyone wears matching gray jumpsuits... Just an amazing voice. Strangely soothing and peaceful. If I'm having a hard time going to sleep I'll throw this on and relax and drift off to another land.... It's so beautiful it's almost a religious experience at times... Pick it up!
