 I honestly bought this album because I was born in Iowa and was interested in any good artists from the state.  And oh what a beautiful album I found!  Iowa Waltz feels so authentic in its music.  It resonates with the Iowa dirt where Greg Brown is from.    Greg Brown writes some poetic great songs that are very true to Iowa - and the Midwest in general.    This was a tremendous debut from our modern times' greatest folk artist.  The sound recording sounds average but adds to the rural feel of it.  What a treasure - even if you're not from Iowa!
