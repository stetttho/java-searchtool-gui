 My friend was raving about this CD, so I thought I'd pick it up used.  And wow, I was very disappointed.    I don't remember Fatlip sounding like this at all back in the day.  Basically if you were a fan of the old classic Pharcyde albums, you probably won't dig this at all.    Fatlip doesn't sound corny, cool, goofy, or fun like he did back in his heyday with Pharcyde.  There's a rougher, harder edge to him on this album.    There were a couple of songs that were good, but definitely not in the Pharcyde-style of music.  It sounds like a completely different artist.  He's gotten old, bitter, and tougher over the last decade, which is sad.  Not even a Chali 2na cameo could save this one.  Is hip-hop not fun anymore, Fatlip?
