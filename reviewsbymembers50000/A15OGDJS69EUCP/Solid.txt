 Yet another very solid release from Youssou, who's blessed with a kind-of-high-pitched voice, that still sounds very smooth.  A very distinctive voice that's difficult to forget once you've heard him.  The album has a great adult contemporary pop songs.  It definitely has the very Peter Gabriel-world feel meets modern France-production.  It's difficult to describe his records because they combine a whole lot of genres together.  Even though it's not in English, it's still very catchy and very accessible to the casual listener. I love the atmosphere that this record creates; it feels very heartfelt.  "Nothing's In Vain" is a good place to expand your musical horizons.
