 Sadly this is the last Digable Planets cd ever recorded.    I like this cd better than the original one, even though the original "Reachin" received so much positive press at the time of its release.  This one was basically pushed under the table at its release.   Blowout Comb is really earthy and very jazzy.  There are lots of jazz samples here mixed with live instrumentation.  Blowout has such a vintage jazzy feel to it.    It's a shame that this group broke up after such a great album.
