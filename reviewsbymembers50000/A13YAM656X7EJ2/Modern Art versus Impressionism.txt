 Judy Murrah is a very talented lady. Her book received great reviews which is why I purchased it. However, her personal style is not what I look for in design and embellishing. Her work is very contemporary, and I tend to be much more of a traditionist in design and embellishment. I prefer needlework designs that date as far back as Medieval times. I like order, and I love needle-art to be so beautifully done that one may even frame it as a piece of art. J. Marsha Michler wrote "The Magic of Crazy Quilting: A Complete Resource for Embellished Quilting." Her approach to design and embellishment is much closer to what I prefer in my own work, and her designs can be nicely applied to clothing and other projects as well--not crazy quilting alone. She very clearly illustrates stitching and embellishing techniques, including high quality photo close-ups, making it very easy even for the novice. Another wonderful book that I have found both exciting and artistic is "The Art of Manipulating Fabric" by Colette Wolff. Using your own artistic imagination, both these books can offer any design or look you desire, and both have a much more "serious" presentation of design. If you like a contemporary look to design, then Judy Murrah's "Jazz it Up..." is for you. She gives clear illustrations and close-up high quality photos for examples to follow. Her ideas and designs can be done by even the novice. Happy sewing!
