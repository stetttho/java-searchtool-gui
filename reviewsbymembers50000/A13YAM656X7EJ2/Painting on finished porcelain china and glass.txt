 This book is good for those looking for projects on finished porcelain and glass. Great for the novice, and the craft industry has a huge selection of paint which can be used for Atkins' projects. Her projects are simple for the beginner who is looking for a starting place in artistic porcelain and glass painting. A beginning artist may adapt Atkins' ideas into unique designs and have a finished product in very little time. These projects do not include "true" porcelain or china painting on bisque. For those looking to learn painting on china (as in Limoges, Royal Doulton or Staffordshire China, etc.), "The China Decorator" magazine offers wonderful advice in learning this art as well as including several other excellent resources.
