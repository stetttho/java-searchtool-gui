 I don't like the typical 'chick book,' dripping with sex, billed as 'romance.' To me, these books are no more than soft (and frequently hard) porn cop-outs for writers in order to make easy bucks for  women's fiction genre. Admittedly, many writers do great research for their historical and geographical topics, in spite of the fact that many of the plots are not terribly realistic (but sometimes great fun).  After my husband dragged one book after another from the rack at the drug store thinking I would like romantic genre, I declined, bored with the 'same old-same old.' But when I saw Billie's novel on the rack with a picture of the vintage pickup truck parked outside a diner somewhere on one of America's back roads or highways on the front cover of her book, I was compelled to pick it up. It evoked memories of countless road trips and meals at old diners with our family when we were children, and the very same old pickup truck my fondly remembered Daddy used to give us rides in the back of when we were kids, looking like what Mama called 'orphans' with our long tangled hair from the windy rides.  The book was every bit as good as I had hoped...every character with their problems and blessings as real as life itself. With no glittery coating in this story, it speaks to the heart of those of us living commonly 'realistic' lives.  And what is better than finding romance in the crazy and mixed up mess that makes up life? Billie shows that in all the eccentricities that salt-of-the-earth folk usually have, it is 'love' that brings life's chaos into a cohesive order, and it is 'love' that is the glue that binds neighbors and friends into 'family.'
