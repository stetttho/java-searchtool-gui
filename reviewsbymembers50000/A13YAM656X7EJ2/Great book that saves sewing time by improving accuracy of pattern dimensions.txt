 This is a great resource that takes the mystery out of creating a perfect fit without relying on store-bought patterns that may or may not fit your shape. Who hasn't cut out a clothing pattern only to find that the dimensions are all wrong? How frustrating it is to spend so much money on beautiful fabric and end up scrapping much of it because of sloppy pattern drafting? Some seamstresses (or sewers) cut their patterns on muslin first, and then make adjustments to the pattern from their dress form. But if you work out of the home, the last thing you probably want is to cut a pattern and sew an outfit twice--not to mention that even though muslin isn't horribly expensive, we need to watch our spending. Many of us sew to save on the cost of clothing and improve the life, as well as quality, of our wardrobes. This book often sells for more from dealers than it does from Amazon. It can presently be purchased for over five dollars less through Newark Dressmaker Supply (http://www.newarkdress.com)--a much more affordable price. (2 February 2006)
