 Lyn Waring has given us a wonderful "beginning" millinery "how-to" book for dolls. She lays out creating miniature hats in a simple step-by-step process that anyone who has general knowledge of sewing can follow. Lyn presents 17 styles of hats sewn with just a few basic pattern pieces. She includes some creative ideas for embellishing the hats as well. This book is great for beginning miniature millinery. Once one learns basic hat-making, one may continue on to period hat-making and others. Happy hat making!
