 I purchased this book because of the excellent ratings. Dee Davis's history of decoupage is excellent, giving many black and white photos, etchings and drawings, and 30 pages of color photos of antique decoupage furniture and home decor. However, the "how-to" section of the book can be challenging. Mrs. Davis is from the U.K., and although she has attempted to include resource information for both the U.K. and the U.S., the generic names of some resources that must be used for certain approaches are not given for the American market. It's frustrating for one who has never created decoupage art.   The instructions, while well enough described in her text, do not have any photos and have few (well-done) illustrations to accompany the information. If you are "visually oriented" as many artists are, "text-only" without well-defined instructions can be very challenging. If you prefer "show-me" instructions in conjunction with, or instead of "tell-me," this book may not be for you.  If you already have experience in decoupage, this book probably will not present anything new to what you have already learned. I believe that this book would work best for beginners in the U.K. because of the list of resources Mrs. Davis has given.
