 It seems that Craig Hawkins' book was written for classroom/educational purposes from the format in which it was written. He obviously knows his stuff very well from his own personal Protestant Christian tradition; however, I found his format difficult to read as it keeps the book from flowing. One must first read each heading, then listed neo-pagan claim before Hawkins' countered Protestant Christian rebuttal. The result for me was dry reading in spite of his thorough research and goodly amount of helpful information. If one doesn't mind this type of format, his book is absolutely full of valuable information. It's great to read both sides of the issue of Goddess worship, neo-paganism, and wicca. However, I personally prefer a flowing prose format which more naturally connects each section of the book. Hawkins' book would be invaluable in a church class/instructional setting for family and friends to gain a better insight and understanding into their loved ones' involvement in Goddess worship, neo-paganism, or witchcraft/wicca.
