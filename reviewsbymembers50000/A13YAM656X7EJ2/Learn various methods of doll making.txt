 Wow! I had no idea one may create dolls in so many various ways! Eloise Piper teaches fabric, modeling paste, and polymer clay doll-making with patterns included in her book. She includes plain Amish children, fancy dolls, wig creating, sculpting facial features, decorating and dressing the doll. She even includes patterns for their tiny clothing! She gives embellishment ideas as well. Furthermore, Eloise has a very delightful style of writing that brings her dolls to life! I greatly enjoy authors like Eloise who present their art in a down-to-earth and humorous fashion. Not only does one enjoy creating the dolls and their adorable wardrobes, but one may count on a chuckle or two from Eloise's light-hearted humor. This book is a keeper for those who are looking for resources which address the multiple and various techniques of creating dolls. Happy doll making!
