 Unless you live in town or a city, can afford to purchase countless ingredients in Miss Webb's recipes from alternate sources such as health food stores or expensive grocery stores, don't count on finding many of  these ingredients in your average run-of-the-mill grocery store in a small  town. These meals may take little time to prepare, but if you're not in a  higher income-bracket and you have a family to feed, you probably won't  like this book.
