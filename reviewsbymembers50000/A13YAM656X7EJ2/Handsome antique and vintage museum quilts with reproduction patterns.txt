 In Alex Anderson's episode of "History Repeating Pattern Writing" (May 2005, HGTV, episode QLT-922) on "Simply Quilts" which is broadcast on HGTV (and the older episodes on DIY), she visited the Shelburne Museum in Rochester, New York, with its hundreds of valuable antique quilts spanning from the late 19th to the 20th century. Francie Quinn, one of this book's illustrator's, was Alex's guest on this program. While Celia Oliver offers the history of the Shelburne Museum quilts in this book, Francie has reproduced some of these stunning antique and vintage quilts, and you will find them in this book along with templates for five projects. Although the book is no longer available through Amazon (except through book dealers), the book is still available at its original price through Hoopla Patterns in Vermont (licensed by the Shelburne Museum, Old Sturbridge Village, the Vermont Quilt Festival, and Lancaster Quilt & Textile Museum.; http://www.hooplapatterns.com/engrace.htm#eg). The reproduction patterns are beautiful, and Hoopla offers reproduction fabric as well to make these quilts as authentic as possible. This is a great resource for recreating traditional American quilts.
