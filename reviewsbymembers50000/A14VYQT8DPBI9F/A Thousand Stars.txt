 I have read and memorized Rhonda Rich's book and consider her to be something of a Biblicist on propriety, the southern version, in particular.  What else need be said?  Her book and the woman herself are testimonies to  the oh so rare consideration of a civilized society - one where women are  allowed to be feminine and men are men - but so much more - I would advise  all women from everywhere to read this book and apply it to their lives and  further, I would encourage all men to read this book to help them  understand.  Grace and charm are, for some completely stupid reason,  undervalued in today's society.  And while Rhonda may be tongue-in-cheek  sometimes, and God bless her for that, she only does it to serve a most  valued end to her argument that life would be ever so much nicer if we were  polite, forgiving, and God forbid, NICE to each other.  I say Bravo!  Rhonda, please write a thousand books! You are a wonderful sage!
