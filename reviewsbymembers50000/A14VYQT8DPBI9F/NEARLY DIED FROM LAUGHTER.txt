 I consider myself a reasonably humorous and clever woman, but I'm sorry, Dave Barry kills me.  I don't know how this illness/affection began - I guess it was his column.  But then I read that crazy "Naked Came the  Manatee" and thought it was high time somebody - namely Barry and his  nut ball bunch of cronies - told the literary world to just go take a deep  breath and get over it - the rules, the pomposity, the whatever.  So I  grabbed a copy of "Big Trouble" at a book fair in Nashville last  October, and found myself setting my alarm for five-thirty to get up and  read more.  Pardonny moi - Franchaise fer excuuuusse me - Room service  thought I was borderline from the laughter they heard behind my door -  imagine trying to convince a waiter at six in the morning that this book  you're reading is the funniest thing in the world - believe me - HE DOESN'T  CARE!   And, no, I didn't turn room service in on expenses!  Thank God, I  was in a place that if I fell out of bed I wouldn't hurt myself.  He needs  this review like King Kong needs fur.  Nevermind.  I'm still here to say  that if laughter is the best medicine, this book could cure diseases!  I  actually met Dave at a Literacy Partners "do" in NY - and gotta  tell y'all, he's a peach of a guy.  A very, very funny and very nice peach.   Buy the darn book in hardcover and read it out loud to your friends.  It  will expand your social life.  People might say you're getting mellow.  At  least they'll say you're an edgy kind of reader.  Is "edgy" a  word?
