 I rarely write reviews because I am loathe to criticize anyone.  And, this review is not to criticize ISLANDS but to remark on the reviews left by others.  Anne Rivers Siddons is the undisputed Queen of Southern Letters and I just have to say that I think some of these reviews are gratutiously unkind.  That's all.  I think that if Anne left her grocery list on my kitchen counter it would fascinate me for days and weeks.  I read ISLANDS and thought it was wonderful for a whole host of reasons.  Maybe she was trying to say something beyond the story line.  Maybe some of the readers expected something else.  But there is no reason to be so judgmental - for writers, more than the average person, words mean a lot.  All that said, ARS is still the Queen in my book.  People who read are generally great folks.  What's up here?  I have no idea!
