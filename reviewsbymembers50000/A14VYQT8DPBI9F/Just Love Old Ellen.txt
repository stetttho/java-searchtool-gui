 Here's my two cents for Ellen Foster - a classical triumph!  I read everything Kaye Gibbons writes and just marvel at it all.  But, can I just have a word with some of these reviewers about their comments on Ms.  Gibbons' punctuation or lack of it?  If I couldn't follow a story because  of quotation marks, I think I'd keep that little ol' tidbit to myself and  not tell the whole world.  Know what I mean?  Ms. Gibbons has style, y'all.   Let's try to raise our bar.  If you want another read in this vein, try  THE HUNT CLUB by Bret Lott.  It's a peach.
