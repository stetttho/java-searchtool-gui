 Elinor Lipman needs an endorsement like a hole in the head.  If you don't own this book, buy it now.  Ms. Lipman is one of the most arresting and delightful writers today.  She dances with words and characters as though  they were precious gems, some glisten with their polished portrayal and  others exist to demonstrate our human imperfections.  Harvey Dash sounds  like someone I used to date - the classic bottom of the pile guy with a  geiger counter for a libido, clicking like mad when within proximity of a  possible encounter with any opportunity, and I mean - any. Men like him are  a waste of food - but you won't regret one moment you give to Ms. Lipman's  work. Better yet, buy them all!  I recommend her work every chance I get!
