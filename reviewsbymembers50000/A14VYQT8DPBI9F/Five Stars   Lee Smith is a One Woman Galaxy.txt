 What some "reviewers" - including those who cannot spell - seem to miss, is the whole point of Lee Smith.  In the "Literary Wrold", there are storytellers, there are wordsmiths and there are  artists.  Lee Smith is an artist of the first order and arguably one of the  most important voices in American fiction writing today.  While I run like  a mad woman to buy her work every time a new title of hers appears, I read  her stories for pleasure but also for an education.  She is a risk taker  and in this world of bottom line guarantees to stock holders, it is  imperative to support those who take those risks.  Read Lee Smith with both  eyes, your heat and your mind wide open.  Look behind her words, plots, and  characters.  She isn't to be taken lightly, but to be regarded with great  respect. Not only is her work marvelous, she is a marvel.  I say, Bravo!   Ms. Smith, don't let any of these ignoramouses give you a moment's pause -  you just keep up your excellent work!
