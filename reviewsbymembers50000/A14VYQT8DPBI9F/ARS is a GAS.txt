 Anne Rivers Siddons needs a review from me like a hole in the head, but here I am anyway.  I just pried myself from the sofa and decided I had to do this.  Anne, I am ablush with pride for you and if you can't hear my  applause, you must have that old air conditioner cranked to the max.  I  laughed out loud reading NORA NORA so many times my family thought I was  finally going off my rocker.  Y'all, go buy this book, jump in the hammock  and give yourselves a treat.  I enjoyed every single page.  You will too.
