 I have been involved in every aspect of the selling profession for the last 20 years, coporate sales, consulting, new business development, sales relationship management and sales training. I worked for three years for one of the greatest sales trainer in the market, and as I was finishing this book, I kept telling myself how little the general public knows about the PROFESSION of selling. For all sales person, who on the daily basis, tries to make a living, this book will be a great supporting tool. You will be able to finally be really proud of the historical aspects of the selling profession, knowing that our profession is one of the hardest to pick up as a career.  Walter Friedman captures the real picture behind the daily struggles that sales people go through on a daily basis. Great read and very entertaining.
