 This is a very well researched book with a great analysis of our current system of government. If one wants to really understand why the conservative party in America has become the dominant force in american politics, well read this book. It will give you a detailed historical account of the conservative movement, it will explain to you how and why America is the way it is today and why it is such a successful enterprise. Fair and Balanced, as our friends at the Fox network would say. Not only is it very well written, but it is an account from two outsiders who happen to be outstanding British writers. For two European writers to write a fair account of the American conservative movement, after all that garbage, hatred and complete ignorance coming out of the European press, the political establishment and, my personal favorite, the out of touch European intellectuals, this is truly refreshing. One seems to feel that these young writers are wishing the same to happen to their own countries. After the 2004 American presidential election, the French Defence minister, Michele Alliot-Marie, declared, "the USA is a country we don't really understand and don't really know" Oh ! really, Madame la Ministre, where have been for the past 30 years and how did you ever get to the job you are currently holding ? How about traveling the USA instead of just visiting NYC, Washington DC and San Franscisco the next time you decide to come here, and make stupid remarks. So out of touch, but predictable to say the least. And she is a member of the French conservative party herself !  This book is right on, has great details, is well written and is very enjoyable. If you are a conservative you will love it and feel vindicated, if you are a liberal you will hate it and feel humiliated. GREAT BOOK, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !
