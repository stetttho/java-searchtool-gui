 For once, here is an author who is not scared of writing a good and well balanced book about the crusades. The author is trying to make us understand both side of the issues, he is very fair and allow us to make our own decisions about the truth behind the motives of each sides. This book is full of great information, has great details and tells us a great deal about the mentality of each participant, should it be the European nobles, the clergy, Popes, knights or muslims, their leaders and followers. If you are an history buff like me you will really enjoy this book. Easy to read and understand. If you are not an apologist and have an open mind you will enjoy Thomas F. Madden's great work.
