 Here is another great and funny book from Mr. Buckley. Are these real life situations or just possibilities ?  Just like his father, Christopher finds the right tone and the right sense of humor to make fun of our politicians. Mr. Buckley please keep writing and amuse us. We need it in today's political environment. Great book , and as always very well written.
