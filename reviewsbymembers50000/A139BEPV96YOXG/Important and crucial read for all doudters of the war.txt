 Bravo, John Keegan. The author, a truly great historian, once again, provides the readers with a truly remarkable account of the truth behind the policies of the war in Iraq. Unlike all the deranged arguments from the liberals, John Keegan tells us all the historical and real reasons why the U.S and Great Britain took the courageous path to liberate and change the course of history in Iraq. He allows us to understand the historical, political, and cultural aspects of the importance of our current policies. As you read his book, is it easy to understand how our sacrifice will help reshape the future of the region. Too many people have suffered under the dictator, and too many people have been lied to by the Hussein government. As you get to the final chapters of the book, one will also understand how successful this campaign has been, and how the military has conducted itself in a great manner to bring a fast and secure victory for the people of the region. Much still has to be accomplished to bring stability and peace to Iraq, however unlike the liberal press's view point and final analysis, Iraq is truly a better place then it once was. The final phrase of the book defines this campaign beautifully. "The reality of the Iraq campaign of March-April 2003 is, however, a better guide to what needs to be done to secure the safety of our world than any amount of law-making or treaty-writing can offer". Music to our ears.   Bravo !! Senator John Kerry, John Edwards and Democatric Party, please read this book and stop making stupid remarks.
