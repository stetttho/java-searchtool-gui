 WOW !! The master writer is at it again ! The Right Stuff is one of Tom Wolf's very best work. This book is so good that it is hard to put down. The story of America's best fliers, John Glenn, Chuck Yeager, Guss Grissom and many others, is not only terrific but also griping. Tom Wolfe gets personal, in a very positive way, in introducing us to the wifes of these test pilots and future astronauts. By doing it, he is telling us what it must of have been like to be the wife of a man who decides to take on the most dangerous profession in the world for the glory of it all. It brings us back to a time when real heroes were very much part of our livelyhood.  He is also very accurate with his characters and timeline. He is detailed oriented and has done extensive research to make his book come alive. Breathtaking and thrilling. A MUST READ.
