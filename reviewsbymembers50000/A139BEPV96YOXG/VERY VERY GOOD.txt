 Anyone who truly believes that, we Americans treat our prisoners down at Gitmo so badly, should read this book and learn about the prison system in China. Some of the stories in this book are just incredible and fascinating. Not just some State Department false overview. This is real down and dirty reporting. It is a strong representation of what China is all about. The bad and the good. Very well written with many great details. The authors know their stuff well and have done some incredible research to write this great book. For anyone who is fascinated by China, its history, culture, social and political structures, this is a book for them. I knew something about China, but this book taught me much more. It's like I was there seeing it with my own eyes. Dated but very much needed if one wants to know why China is where it is today. Should we be worried about a rising China, NO, should we be amazed, YES. Wonderful book and very readable.
