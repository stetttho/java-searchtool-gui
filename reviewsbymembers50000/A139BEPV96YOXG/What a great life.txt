 Once again, William Buckley delights the readers with his writing perfection. His life is truly amazing and he has proven to all of us that he is the master writer that we all know so well. His travels are fascinating. His family well balanced, and his desire to tell us how right he is about everything truly fascinating. If you are a Buckley fan and have enjoyed his many writings and speaking appearances, (National review,Firing Line, Books, lecture circuit or music performances) you will enjoy this book. It is well detailed and easy to read. It will take you from his early life in Connecticut, Mexico, Yale University,to the present in a perfect time frame. Highly recommended and truly enjoyable. Bravo Mr. Buckley, please continue to write.
