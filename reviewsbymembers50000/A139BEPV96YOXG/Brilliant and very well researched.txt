 This book offers some really interesting and accurate theories of how America, the world's whipping boy, has done all it can to save and maintain stability on our planet. Great strength comes with great responsibilities, and the US has certainly done so. We are the most powerful nation on the planet, we give more money away than anybody else, we are willing to sacrifice our young men for other people's problems, and not only that, but we are the only ones who can do it because of our democratic ideas and freedom. Just like the author describes in this book, America has had two main interests since it birth, to create the greatest democracy in the world and to protect itself from foreign interventions. This country has been through many crises, but has always bounced back. WWI, WWII, Korean War, Vietnam, 9/11 and now Iraq.  Having lived in Europe for 16 years, I truly believe that we are the envy of the world. The left always complains that our country acts like an imperial power, but let's not forget that if it looks that way, it is because we need to protect our interests in order to survive. Also, the Iraq war, well here again, the killers and terrorists have decided to take us on within our own borders by killing in a matter of 30 minutes 3,850 of our fellow citizens. We did not ask for this war, they brought it to us.  I say this book is great for four reasons, 1) it is a great history tool, 2) it allows the reader to really understand why this country has been so successful,3) why it is crucial for America to be the protector of democracy in order to help others defeat communism and tyranny 4)and why the USA is the most compassionate country on the face of the earth. And this coming from a Frenchman !!. As the author states, "You have heard all the lies now hear the truth". So true and so well said!! Great book, well written and very enjoyable. Highly recommended
