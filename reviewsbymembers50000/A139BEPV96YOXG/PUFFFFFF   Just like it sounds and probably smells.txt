 [...]But let's go back to the movie itself : stupid, not credible, wrong facts and un-american. Now that the 2004 Presidential election returned our beloved President George W. Bush to the White House with 10 million more votes than he received in 2000 and 5 million more votes that the Kerry/Edwards loosing and incompetent campaign got, where have you gone Mr. Moore? Why has your propaganda movie not made any dents in the confidence of the American people for their beloved President ? Is it because your hate,your lies, your greed in making a movie to increase your own wealth, your own misguided facts and your despicable agenda, which by the way, gives comfort to the Islamo fascists, have been uncovered, or is it because the American people just didn't buy your anti-Americanism ? I believe both. Oh!, actually, I am sorry, now I know where you have been, your hate machine is back, vomiting more lies and hate, making you a permanent laughingstock.  Oh!, here is an idea Mr Moore, the 2006 mid term election is coming up, could you make another one of your hateful documentaries, we need your help to increase the Republicans'majority in both Houses of congress. Your movie was a great help the last time, so we need another one by Summer 2006, if you know what I mean ! Wink, Wink !!!! Mr Moore, shut up and sing!!!!!!!!
