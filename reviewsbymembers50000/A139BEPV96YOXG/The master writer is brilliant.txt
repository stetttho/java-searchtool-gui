 Bill Buckley is once again brilliant. This book is fun, full of suspence and has great historial footnotes. All the characters come to life and since Buckley utilizes real people as characters one has the sense that history is revisited here. Buckley is a brilliant writer and story teller. It is hard these days to find good, serious and fun novel writers, well Mr. Buckley is one of those. My only worry : Is this book his swan song?
