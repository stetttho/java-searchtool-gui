 I approached this book with some scepticism(after all John Allen does write columns for the National Catholic Reporter) but I was truly surprised by how balanced John allen's analysis of how the vatican operates came out. This book is well balanced and has some great information for anyone trying to understand the inner workings of the vatican. Highly recommended and very well written. A little dated though. Very good read and full of great info.
