 Terrific book, very well written and for all of us born in the 60's and having a small rememberance of the Apollo program, this read will bring us back to those incredible years. For eveybody who was born later on and are looking for people who accomplished great achievements, this is a must read. Those guys are heroes. I remember being in Paris, just 7 years old in 1973 and meeting some of these astronauts on their worldwide tour, this was the proudest moment of my life. I shall never forget it. It is strange to me that we as a nation, have forgotten how great those people were and how proud they made Americans feel at the time. Great story with great details, this is a story that should be told over and over. Thank you Andrew Chaikin for allowing us to revisit those moon years. A must read for all students and future generations.
