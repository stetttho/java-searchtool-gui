 It's all here, the history of capitalism, finance, Wall Street, Financial Barons and the rise of American capitalism. Ron Chernow's book is marvelous and eloquant. While reading this book, you will not only be amazed at the accomplishements of the Morgans and their close advisors, but also at how they were able to make themselves the dominant force on Wall Street. Also fascinating here, is how they were able to help our nation become the richest and most successful financial enterprise ever. J.P Morgan has had a lasting effect on American and overseas finances and industrialization. Governments came to them for financial backing in time of need, wars and economical crises. Their dominant position in the financial markets saved England and America during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Without their input and capital, none of it would have been possible. They were the pioneers, George Peebody, the patriarc, even shook the English financial establishment into a new financial era. Today's Wall Street is no longer the place it once was, where gentlemen could shake hands on deals and had enough class to compete in good faith. The Morgan Guaranty building, the place where J.P. Morgan conducted his affairs, (If you travel downtown , you can still see the bullet holes on the building recalling that famous attack on Wall Street in the early twenties)is still standing, empty though. It was not all perfect, but for the most part it was a world that many envied. Many wanted to emulate them. The Morgans were true patriots, and loved their country. They traveled the world around to promote American capital (China, Europe and Japan) allowing it become the most powerful entity in world trade.  In this book, Ron Chernow is eloquant and detail oriented. He does not miss a single point. He has done his research and made sure that all types of readers could enjoy this book. Remarkable, straight forward and Highly recommended
