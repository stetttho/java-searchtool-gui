 Ronald Reagan's speech in favor of Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign was the starting point of his political career. His successful campaign for governor of California, against incumbent Pat Brown, was the start of the conservative movement. His ability to bring together the Birch society members, the conservative democrats, Republican moderates and other conservatives proved that Reagan was a political genius. Many believed that a B movie actor, former Roosevelt democrat, GE pitchman, and former union member could never be considered a serious political campaigner. How wrong they were ! Matthew Dallek, in this wonderfully written account goes to great length to describe all the events surrounding that first campaign, the race riots (Watts), the student uprising at Berkeley, the divisions within both the democratic and conservative parties, and all the characters who were directly involved in the campaign. He is fair and allows the reader to really understand how the conservative movement in America really started with Reagan's first successful run in California. He also tells us that Reagan became a true hero and political mentor to many politicians, as is the case of the current Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzeneger. Both men had many different political beliefs, but they both had great personal charisma. Their foundations are very similar. This is a great book with many details. Highly recommended and very enjoyable to read.
