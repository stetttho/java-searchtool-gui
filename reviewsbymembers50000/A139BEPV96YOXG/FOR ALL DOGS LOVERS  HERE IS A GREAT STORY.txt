 This is a wonderful written account about the courage and endurance of some wondeful dogs and their drivers.  Their story of courage is recalled here, with great details, and tells us of how great the dedication of these drivers, to get the life saving serum to Nome in order to help contain the deadly diphtheria epidemic, was. Nome, Alaska, once the Gold Rush's main destination needed urgent help to contain a life threating epedimic. Drivers and their brave dogs were called upon to transport and get the serum to the city. Men have always had dogs as their best friend, now they relied on their endurance and courage to save hundreds of people in need. Even in the early stages of Alaskan commercial flights, dogs were the only true reliable partners of men. Just imagine for a moment, the icy cold conditions, the blizzards, the cracking of the ice as the sleigh made their way over it, and the never ending trails that just seem so lonely and unending. These are the conditions that these dogs and their drivers had to endure. Also, important here, the relationship and trust between the drivers and their dogs, shown here to be strong and deep throughout this great story. One needs the other and vice versa. Balto, Togo are not well known anymore (but for Balto's statue in NYC's central park, no one really recalls their efforts) but for hundreds of people in 1925, these dogs became national heroes and saviors. The one drawback, you feel a certain emptiness, as these wonderful dogs go into retirement, never to be heard of again. When Togo passes away, one feels he has lost a great and dear friend. Great book, very entertaining and highly recommended for everyone. If you are a dog owner or simply love them as such, this is a book for you. Gay and Laney Salisbury, thank you for your wonderful book and for telling the world how great those dogs were !
