 In this beautifully written account of Venice in the 19th century, John Norwich makes his characters come alive. These characters include Napoleon,described here to have a great despise for the city he conquered, and his irresponsible looting of the great city, Lord Byron's eccentric and eclectic lyfestyle, Ruskin's prediction that Venice would decline way before anybody would have forseen it, and many other writers, composers, painters, thinkers and socialites, including, Wagner, Henry James, Robert Browning, Whistler and Sargent. John Norwich describes, here, the decline of Venice in the 19th century with great detail and magnificent prose. Here, also, he tells us of the movements for independence and revolution against the occupation of Austria. Part of those movements is the charismatic leader Daniel Manin. If you are acquainted with Venice and all its eccentricities, this book will delight you. It has everything, intrique, passion, extravagances, and yes, sexual escapades. It reads like a novel but depicts Venice in the 19th century as an attractive place for people wanting to get away from a world that cannot match Venice's beauty, exciting and eccentric being. This book, for a lack of better words, is colorful, delightful and beautifully written. For all lovers of Venice, this is surely a must read. Highly recommended and very enjoyable.
