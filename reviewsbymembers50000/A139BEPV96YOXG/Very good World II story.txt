 Very good story. It seems as soon as one finishes a World War II book there is another great one out there. This is truly one of those. Great story line and a lot of fun to read. The 10th mountain division is one that is not as well known to the general public but should be. Having lived in Europe myself and attended Prep school in the mountains, this story brought back a lot of great memories of the Alps. These guys were truly great, and it is interesting to read about European ski stars, instructors, famous explorers, Prep School boys and IVY Leaguers wanting to join the US mountain division to fight the Nazis. Even though they never really got to use their Skiing and climbing talents to fight the war, as the author states at the end of the book, they were nontheless great warriors. Their entry in the war was a late one, but their service to the cause and their country was a noble one. The Bob Dole segment is also very interesting and the author takes great care to make us understand what war was like during the Second World War. He also takes great care in telling us what warfare does to soldiers under constant bombardement. Good read and a great compliment to other WWII stories. This is a story about heroes. Soldiers never die they just fade away (General McCarthur)
