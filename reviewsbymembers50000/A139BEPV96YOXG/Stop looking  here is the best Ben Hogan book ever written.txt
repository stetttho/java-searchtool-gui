 What a wonderful book and a great gift for all people who love golf and sports history. I have read three other Ben Hogan books, but this one seems truly complete. It has everything from his birth , early family and golf struggles, the triumphs, his come back from an horrible accident, his grand Slam victories to his final struggles to win a fifth US Open. The book describes wonderfully the incredible voyage Mr. Hogan went through. It is very well written and not easy to put down. For anyone who loves the game of golf this will be a real treat.  The author captures the Hawk with great simplicity and allows the readers to feel like they are following Ben Hogan in every tournement he played in. Each events are written with great details.  If anyone believes that they know the man, they should read this book.  I was certain, after reading James Dodson's other great Golf book, Final Rounds, that he would have another winner here. Thank you Mr. Dodson for this wonderful gift. Golf history is better for it.
