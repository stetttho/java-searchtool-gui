 Here is fiction meeting real life. Racy but funny. Tom Wolf is a great writer who takes his time penetrating and understanding effectively all aspects of life. Through this book he reminds us of what college is really all about,with all its clashing cultures inhabiting campuses. I gratuated 15 years ago, are American colleges still like that ? This book is funny, well written and has a little for all of us. My only concern is what Tom Wolf will think of writing next.
