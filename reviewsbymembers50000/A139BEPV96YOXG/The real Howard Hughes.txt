 Great book, with many great details. This book will tell you all you really need to know about this great man. The latest movie about Howard Hughes is nothing compared to this book. What was Hollywood thinking when they decided to make this movie? It did not say anything about his Vegas ventures, which was a crucial time in his life. If one knew about his time in the Flamingo hotel, it would have been easy to relate to his crazyness, mentality and thinking. Nothing also was mentioned in the movie about his voyages around the world, which started it all, and his life after his aviation follies. I know the movie was called "The Aviator", but if you did not know anything about Howard before you saw the movie, then all you would think was that he was some crazy aviator who wasted his time building a giant aircraft that was never used for military or commercial purposes, dated a movie star and was always concerned that the US government was out to distroy him. (Well, the government tried really hard!!) Who knows, maybe Airbus engineers had Howard Hughes in mind when they build their latest aircraft, the giant A380. Mr. Hughes will be forever the pioneer who started it all. In this book though,his life and his legacy are well preserved. It is very well written, it tells use about his dramatic life, his eratic lifestyle and behavior, his connections to everything that was going on in the US at the time, and his constant drive for perfection. Hero or not, he was sometimes crazy but also brilliant. If one really wants to know who Howard Hughes really was, all questions will be answered here. This book will tell you everything. Very long but really good read.
