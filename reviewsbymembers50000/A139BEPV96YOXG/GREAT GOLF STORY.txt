 If you love golf and its history, this is the book. Curt Sampson is once again great and meticulous with the details. He loves the games and its immortal characters.  This is a great golf history book.  The coming about of the greatest rivalry in golf between Palmer and Nicklaus is well detailed here. Ben Hogan, already the greatest golfer of his generation, seemed to be reaching out for his last glory. It seems that the sport is no longer as elegant as it once was because the characters are no longer as heroic as they once were. Highly recommended and a very good book to read over and over.
