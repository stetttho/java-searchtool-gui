 The details here, in this book, are so great that you feel the author had direct contact with the characters. David McCullough's writing is so perfect that the reader feels he is right there witnessing the battles alongside the characters on both sides. The book is extremely well researched, and as a historical work, is very well detailed. McCullough knows the subjet matter very well, and understands the feelings of each characters. He is fair to both sides, the English and Patriots alike. He does not bash, but tells it the way it was. British General Howe, George Washington, Charles Cornwallis, General Green and many others find their name well represented throughout the book. The British won many battles, Kips Bay, Brooklyn, Fort Washington, White Plains, but you find yourself cheering the Americans when they finally turn around their luck and win at Trenton and then Princeton. General Washington, defeated at first, is commanding in his comeback, and becomes the real hero of the American Revolution. He is not a great strategist or even a great commander, but his faith in the cause, his remarkable patience and tenacity ultimatly allows him to become a great figure. He is a towering figure among his troops. Washington never despaired and his tenacity for the "cause" is well documented throughout the book. Very well written and fun to read. No wonder David McCullogh is a national treasure. I can't wait for his next work.
