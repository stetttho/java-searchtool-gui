 Okay, we get the picture.  Ms. Robb/Roberts has stated that the series would have to end if Eve and Roarke had a child.  Apparently, fans must still be clamoring for the blessed event. First we had Mavis getting pregnant rather quickly in her relationship.  Now we have Eve rejecting a child in the house, reaffirming that she is not ready to have a child. What else does the author have to do? --a baby for Peabody and McNabb? --Galahad turns out to be a female and has kittens?  I think this book suffered a little in the process of making a statement.  Eve came across as colder than usual and the action stalled until the end of the book.  Now that this is out of the way, perhaps the next installment will be a 5-star winner.  By the way--I, too, would like to see a baby for Eve and Roarke before the series ends.  There could be some great storylines around it.
