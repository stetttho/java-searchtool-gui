 I made two assumptions before reading this book that turned out to be WRONG.  (1) The cover leads you to believe this is one of Ms. Howard's serious thrillers.  WRONG.  It's a comedy.  (2) I thought I wasn't going to like the ditzy blonde first person style.  WRONG, again.  This book is hilarious.  I did have a couple of problems with the plot and subtracted a star.  Wyatt had stayed away from his soulmate for two years and only came running with an engagement ring when he thought she had been murdered.  How long would he have stayed away if nothing had happened to Blair?  Also, Blair was supposedly only a "dumb blonde" when it suited her.  But I question the intelligence of anyone who thinks someone who cuts her brake line is just stupid and someone who shoots her with intent to kill is just a nitwit.  I wonder if these things bothered anyone else.  Still, these problems did not take too much away from my enjoyment of the book.
