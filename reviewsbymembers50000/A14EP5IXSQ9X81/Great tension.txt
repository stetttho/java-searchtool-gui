 I may be rating this book a little high, but the last couple of books I read were so mediocre that this one seemed great in comparison.  There are some excellent synopses already out there, so all I will add is that the heroine gets in over her head with a really bad bunch of people and the bad-boy hero gets her out; but not without some harrowing situations.  I really enjoyed this book.  The tension created made it hard to put down.
