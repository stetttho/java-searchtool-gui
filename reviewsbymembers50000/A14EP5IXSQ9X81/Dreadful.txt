 Usually love "Pride & Prejudice" in any form; love "Bend It Like Beckham;" love musicals.  Hated this movie.  My only expectation that was fulfilled was a modern Indian version of P&P.  Other than that, the acting was bad (especially Aishwarya Rai--all she did was grimace and roll her eyes); the musical numbers were bad.  If this is Bollywood, then it's not for me.  They need to decide if it's going to be a musical or not.  When the characters suddenly break into song out of nowhere, it just seems ridiculous.  And that's a perfect description of this movie--ridiculous.
