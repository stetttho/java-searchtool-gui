 This reader is happy to report that Ms. Rob/Roberts is back on track with this installment of the In Death series.  The last book (SURVIVOR IN DEATH) had some issues that made the overall book--well--not so great.  But this one is perhaps one of the best in quite some time.  The plot was clever--a famous "saintly" doctor is murdered and it turns out he was involved in cloning, genetic manipulation, and other morally and legally questionable practices.  Throw in the now familiar cast of characters and a little on the home front, and we have a winner!
