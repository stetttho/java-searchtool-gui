 I agree with several of the other reviews of this book.  It will remind you a lot of the television series "Northern Exposure," except Nate comes to small-town Alaska as Police Chief instead of a doctor.  You can actually take a cast list from the series and compare it to the characters in the book.  I also agree that Meg is not as likeable as most heroines, but then she had a jealous slut for a mother and father who went on permanent "walkabout."  Hopefully, some of Nate's goodness will rub off on her.  I enjoyed this book; therefore, the length did not bother me as it did some readers.  Not the greatest, but then I only gave it 4 stars.
