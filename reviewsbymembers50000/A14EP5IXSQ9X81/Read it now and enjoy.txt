 I always eagerly await the newest Amanda Quick/J. Krentz books.  They never fail to please.  Such a light touch!  While this one does not offer anything new, still an enjoyable read.  Caroline and Adam are another great couple.  The hardcover is available now from amazon.co.uk.  (Come on guys, don't edit this out--it's all in the family.)
