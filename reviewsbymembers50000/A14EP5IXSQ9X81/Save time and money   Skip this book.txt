 I don't recall the author's other books being quite as bad as this one.  I almost didn't make it to the end, but I did--and save yourself the trouble--it wasn't worth it.  The hero and heroine were amoral, "do as I say and not as I do" characters who saw nothing wrong with orgies, pornography, or forgery. And what was with the heroine's other family members?  An aunt/servant(?) who looked the other way no matter what her nieces did, including sexual misconduct and forgery.  One sister who lived in la-la land except when she chose to come out of it and make perfect sense.  One sister who was a cross-dresser.  And the youngest sister who was constantly being pulled out of trouble if the others cared enough to check on her.  I could go on with the problems in the book, but I think you get the gist.
