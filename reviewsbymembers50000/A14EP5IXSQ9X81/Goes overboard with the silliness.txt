 This book is a bunch of silly nothingness.  Sometimes, if I'm in the mood, that can appeal to me; but not in this case.  I almost didn't finish it, which would have rated 1 star; but I plowed on through to the end and will give it 2 stars just for accomplishing that.  But, sorry, it goes in the discard pile.
