 I was pleasantly surprised by this book after having read DAUGHTER OF DESTINY (2 stars for didn't like) and GET BLONDIE (3 stars for mediocre).  I was beginning to believe that the Bombshell series was going to "bomb."  But this one is a different matter.  By now I guess readers have figured out that these are not typical romance novels.  They are more like thrillers.  DOVE has a complex plot and interesting characters--a lot more depth than I was expecting.  I would read more books with Nova and Joe.
