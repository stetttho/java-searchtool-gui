 Readers expecting a heterosexual romance involving Navy SEAL Cosmo need to be aware that they will get that in this book as well as a gay storyline involving FBI Agent Jules.  Suzanne Brockmann has really opened a can of worms with this one.  Do you or do you not mix the gay with the hetero in romance novels?  I have no objection to the Jules character, but I was certainly not expecting such a heavy dose of his love life when I purchased this book.  Therefore, I subtracted 2 stars.  Perhaps he should have had his own book so readers would know what they were getting instead of mixing his story in with Cosmo's.
