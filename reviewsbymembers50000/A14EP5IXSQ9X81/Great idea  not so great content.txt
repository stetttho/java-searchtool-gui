 It was a good idea--connecting the 3 different romance genres (regency/historical, contemporary, & futuristic) by writing around a common object (mysterious box) in the past, present, and future.  Unfortunately, the stories were mediocre at best, with the first one (Yesterday's Magic) being perhaps the best of the three.  This one is going in my discard pile.  I would not recommend it unless you are willing to be only moderately amused.
