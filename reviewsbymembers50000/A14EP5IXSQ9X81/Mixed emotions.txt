 I enjoyed this book in general.  It had an interesting plot involving genealogy and DNA (even though I had to keep referring to the family tree in the front of the book).  But I felt the author went a little over the top with "The Senator" character.  He was a man of no conscience or morals who had sex (willing or unwilling) with any woman within reach, left a string of illegitimate children, and committed incest on top of incest.  And no one called his hand.  Even if these things were not mentioned back in those days, I find it hard to believe that some of the families in this story wouldn't have done away with him before he reached old age.  I took away one star for Dan's parentage alone.  If you read the book, you'll know what I'm talking about.  Gross!  And the characters were all willing to live and let live until Carly shows up and stirs the pot. Maybe it's just me, but it was just too much.
