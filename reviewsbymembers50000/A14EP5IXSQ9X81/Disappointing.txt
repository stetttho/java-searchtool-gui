 I bought the first 4 books in the Bombshell Series, and this was the first one I read.  What a disappointing start!  I gave it 2 stars because although the author set up a pretty good plot, I just didn't care for what she did with it. It's always a bad sign when I start scanning through to get to the end, and that's what I did with this book.  Also, there is very little romance in this book.  Kai and Jake spend the whole time tip-toing around each other.  Am I mistaken, or is this supposed to be a romance series?  Hopefully, things will get better with the next book.
