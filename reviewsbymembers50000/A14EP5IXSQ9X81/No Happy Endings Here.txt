 I usually enjoy Tami Hoag's books because of the suspenseful plots and the element of romance.  While I did enjoy the plot and hearing from characters in a previous book, there was no happy ending to this book.  Nope, no boy gets girl.  There was nothing to relieve the stress of the story line.  Neither of the main characters (Sam and Nikki) came out a winner, and I felt badly for them.  Tami Hoag fans should, of course, read it; but don't expect to come away smiling after the last page is turned.
