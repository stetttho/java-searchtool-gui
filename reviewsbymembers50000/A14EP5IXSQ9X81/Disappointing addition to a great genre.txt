 I hate to give a bad review to any new futuristic romance since it is my favorite genre and new ones are hard to find, but (you saw it coming, didn't you?) I simply didn't care for this one. The plot was confusing.  I never figured out where the characters were coming from and; thus, none of them could ever really "grow" on me.  It's not the worst I have ever read and I DO like this genre, so I give it 1 extra star.
