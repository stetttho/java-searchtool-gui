 If you are a fan of the IN DEATH series like me, this will not be among your favorites.  It lacks the edge of a NAKED..., VENGEANCE..., or CONSPIRACY...for example (which are my personal favorites).  But still, we know the characters so well, that it is always a pleasure to get the new volume, sit back, and rejoin old friends.  I am interested to see how Ms. Robb/Roberts keeps this series going.  I believe she has stated that if all the issues were resolved, the series would end.  But to keep readers coming back for more, there still has to be new and exciting developments and plots.  This volume had nothing new to offer, and I can see how some readers are discouraged.  But I still enjoyed it.  Does this make sense to anyone out there?
