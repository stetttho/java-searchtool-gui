 I was also reminded of the movie "Miss Congeniality" when I read this book--beauty pageant world turns nasty.  But no one was hurt in the movie; even the violence at the end was slapstick comedy.  What bothered me about the book was that the mixture of silly romantic comedy and psychological thriller didn't work.  The ugly undertones and tragic climax did not fit the light "tone" of the book.  And the Epilogue went right back to silliness, as though nothing bad had happened.  I would have given it 3 stars up until the end.
