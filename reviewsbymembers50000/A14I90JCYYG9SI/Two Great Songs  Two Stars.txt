 Brandy and Jimmy Loves Mary-Ann are two spectacular songs.  They are worth the whole price of this CD.  They had better be.  The rest of the album is worthless.  There is not one memorable song on the rest of the album.  But, so what, I've listened to these two songs about 50 times and they are beautiful.  I know that so-called "one-hit wonders" is a common pattern in pop music. But, how could any songwriter have two musical ideas as outstanding as these, and then find himself with nothing more to say?
