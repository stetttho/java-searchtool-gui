 I first purchased this album on vinyl when it was released in the late 60's.  "Sgt. Pepper" had just been released and influenced most of the top bands, The Stones, The Rascals, and so on, to experiment in the same fashion.  Most of their efforts were miserable failures, for example, "Her Satanic Majesty's Request," with the exception of this masterpiece by The Rascals.  "It's Wonderful" was a hit record, despite a few minutes of goofy lambs' bleeting at the end, a la "Hey Jude," but it is certainly not the best cut.  "Rainy Day," "Silly Girl," "My Hawaii," and the title track are simply beautiful songs.  Felix Cavaliere and Eddie Brigati, the principal songwriters of the group, have never written better music.  I followed their musical development very carefully for the rest of the group's professional life, and this album was by far their best effort.  In fact, this album in vinyl format is still routinely for sale on Ebay due to demand and because it has never been re-released in America.  When The Rascals were inducted in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame a few years ago, it was a shame that Cavaliere-Brigati were not inducted as songwriters as well.  Nevertheless, this album will be played enthusiastically 40 years from now, for the same reasons we are still in love with it almost 40 years after its initial release.
