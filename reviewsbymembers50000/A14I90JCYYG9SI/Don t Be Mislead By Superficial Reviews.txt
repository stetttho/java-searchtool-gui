 Don't be mislead by superficial reviews of a supposedly superficial movie.  This is a movie for everyone who ever went someplace else to find himself.  A group of teen-aged girls go on a road trip to Ft. Lauderdale to spend Spring Break.  On the way, they join some guys who are doing the same thing.  As each of them finds peace with his or her own personal dilemma, they emerge as adults ready to face adult obligations.  They will have problems, even big ones, but you can see that because they know more about themselves and each other, they will be able to face their futures with wisdom and courage.  Everyone, and I mean, everyone in the cast performs beautifully.  The film is funny, moving, insightful, and entertaining and I haven't changed my opinion since I first saw it when I was a lost teen. Maybe I'm getting more out of it than the author intended, but this film will make you care about the characters and feel good about the future, your own and everyone else's.
