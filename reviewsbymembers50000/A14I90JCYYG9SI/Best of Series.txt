 Four soldiers are shot in the head in battle and develop superhuman intelligence and mind control abilities.  Working independently and without even being aware of each other's existence, they use alien technology to invent four devices which when assembled will take themselves and a shipload of crippled children to another galaxy. A government investigator, played with sinister earnestness by Robert Duvall, reporting to the highest levels of the U.S. government, suspects Communists (not by name) but finds himself always one small step behind in foiling their plans.  He finally catches up with them moments before they complete construction of the spacecraft.  The surprise ending is worth waiting for the story to unfold.  In fact, the waiting is the best part. The story is convincing, the pacing is excellent, and you won't want to leave the room for a second. I don't think there is a bad episode in the whole series, but this is one of the best.  There is also something about black and white film that deepens your fears and darkens a mystery.  I enjoyed this episode, the only two-part, two-hour episode in the series, so much that I bought it. I watch it a lot because it makes me feel that the unknown is full of good things.  If you worry a lot about your future, so will you.
