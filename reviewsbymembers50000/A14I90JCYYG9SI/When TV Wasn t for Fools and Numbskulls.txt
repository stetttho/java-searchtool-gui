 Believe it if you can, but once upon a time TV aspired to reveal what we ought to be rather than what we are.  TV once created heroic figures that exalted the best of what it means to be human, instead of degrading the human spirit by showing us at our worst and most depraved.  And then they add insult to injury by calling it "reality TV."  Like that is what human nature is really like.  Well, HGWT is the other side of that coin.  It makes you believe in yourself, and that people can be more and better than they are, if only they try hard enough to be.  It makes you realize that one man with purpose and clarity can make a difference.  Not just because he is there to serve as an example.  But because most people want and need and can't be happy until what they ought to be, they are.  HGWT is not just a story of one man with courage who cares.  It's about the best of us.
