 The Turtles created a lot of great music.  No, they didn't break new ground, raise the bar with innovative musical ideas, or leap traditional barriers with a single bound.  They did, however, present some very pleasant tunes with great hooks that make you feel happy no matter how many times you've heard them.  Maybe making people feel good doesn't count for much in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but where I live The Turtles will never be forgotten for helping make the late 60's the greatest half-decade of the century.
