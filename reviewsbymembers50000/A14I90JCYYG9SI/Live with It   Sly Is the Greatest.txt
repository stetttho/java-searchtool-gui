 Why all the criticism of Sly Stallone?  He can't act, we are told.  He can't express emotion.  He can't speak.  He is a one-character actor.  It's time to be honest:  He can do what most actors on the cover of People every week can only dream of.  He gets people to buy a movie ticket, and he commands their interest and attention for two hours.  And he's been doing it for a generation.  It's him.  It's not the director, the screenwriter, the set designer, or the special effects.   How many other actors can make that claim?  Long after the no-talent pretty boys who are 90% marketing have gone back to waxing eyebrows, Stallone's movies will be bringing joy to millions of people in theaters and on TV for years to come.  John Wayne, Steve McQueen, Errol Flynn, Sly Stallone, Clint Eastwood:  There's a reason we can't take our eyes off them.
