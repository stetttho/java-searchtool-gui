 I have been a Burt Reynolds fan since the earliest days of his movie career.  Once the top actor in the world, with Clint Eastwood, Burt, unfortunately, made it big in films like Gator, Cannonball Run, Stroker Ace, and the Dixie Dancekings.  It was one of those rare moments in Hollywood when a pretty actor and a new film genre fuse completely.  And when the genre loses its appeal, so does the actor.  In music, look what happened to the Bee Gees when disco self-distructed.  But Reynolds is a very competent actor.  Watch The Longest Yard, Sharkey's Machine, and Boogie Nights.  This film belongs among them:  Burt has never been better.  He's believable, complex, and engaging.  He plays mentor to a would-be cat burglar with more ambition than brains, and you will find yourself thoroughly engrossed in his next lesson.  He can underplay a role like nobody else.  Yet he manages to bring out the character's deepest thoughts and feelings doing little things that few other actors would bring to a role, even if they had the wisdom and life experience to draw from.  Today's pretty boys are 80% marketing, and know about as much about real-life as my house cat knows about the jungle.
