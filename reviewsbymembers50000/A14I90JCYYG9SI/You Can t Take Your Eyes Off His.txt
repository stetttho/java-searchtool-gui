 Did Steve McQueen ever deliver a bad performance on film?  This film is no exception.  Although it is rarely shown on TV, due to its subject matter, and the huge popularity of McQueen's action films, this is a wonderful film.  The cast is wonderful, beginning, of course, with McQueen, and the characters are deep and personal.  You won't be able to find a single flaw in their performances or the "little" story.  It's about a man who is still doing his best to be true to old-fashioned values and ideals that the modern world has forgotten and discarded.  Follow McQueen's eyes, always.  Don't take your eyes off his.  His eyes will tell you the story in every one of his films.  I believe this is one of his best performances simply because there is so much of the man in the character he portrays.  Read a McQueen biography.  There are several that are worthy.  He was the last film star with charisma.  (I don't know what it is either, but I know it when I see it.)  All I know is that his best work was done in roles like this one, when he portrays characters that are out of their proper time, and misplaced in a world that no longer values, and has no place for, honor, integrity, courage, loyalty, honesty, humility, dedication, or even knows where they come from.  When I watch a Steve McQueen film like this one (The Getaway is another example) it makes me feel good.  It's not because he is always the victor, or because the "bad guys" are always defeated, but because he makes trying to live by those ideals, and never giving up, look so honorable and so noble that it makes me want to keep trying, too.  He makes me feel that it's better to live life his way, and be a loser, than to be a success in a world without feeling, meaning, or emotion.
