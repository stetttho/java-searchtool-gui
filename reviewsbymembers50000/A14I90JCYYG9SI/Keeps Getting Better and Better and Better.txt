 I never tire of seeing this film.  Charlton Heston's performance is filled with tiny bits that provide depth and meaning, but may easily be overlooked on first viewing.  He walks a tightrope between hopefulness and despair beautifully.  I especially like the way he defends the present state of his life to Robinson, who constantly criticizes their situation, while he expresses horror and disgust at the state of the world to practically everyone else. Watching him solve the murder is not as interesting as getting to know him as a character or what our world has become.  The murder itself is almost an excuse to introduce and develop his character.  Today, this film would be followed by several sequels and pre-quels based solely on this compelling character.
