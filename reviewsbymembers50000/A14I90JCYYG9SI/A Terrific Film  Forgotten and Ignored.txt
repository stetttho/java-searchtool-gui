 You would think that simply the huge popularity of wrestling in this country would lead Hollywood to consider again releasing this film on video or on DVD for the first time.  This would be reason enough, as it has been in the past for way too many films that deserved to be ignored, like, say, those abominable spy films from the 60s rereleased because of the success of the Austin Powers series.  But this is an excellent film in every way and merits release.  The acting, story, photography, and the other creative contributions fit together beautifully in a film that will engage you, inspire you, and move you.  Peter Falk, always superb, leads a female wrestling team through several years of struggle against corrupt managers, dishonest competitors, and their own emotional failings until they finally achieve the top position in the wrestling world by winning a final spectacular match.  It's a journey you will be happy you took with them, believe me.  Yes, this film will make you smile, cheer, and  weep, but, mostly, it will make you see again that where there is hope, there is life.  And we all need to be reminded of that, especially these days.
