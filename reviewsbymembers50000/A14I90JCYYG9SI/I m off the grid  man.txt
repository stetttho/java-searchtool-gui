 I'm only writing this review because I noticed that no one else has bothered to praise this film in about five years.  It is a wonderful film.  No, it didn't win any important awards, didn't make a billion dollars at the box office, and didn't star any tabloid-worthy, of-the-moment celebrities.  What it does have is a subtle yet compelling story of hope and self-discovery populated with full, rich characters that are the kind of people we all secretly pray will find their way into our lives, but so rarely do, and fill it with meaning in a sorry world that is otherwise devoid of honest feeling and emotion.  With all the sham and drudgery in everyday life, isn't it worth a couple of hours of your time and a few bucks to get out of the grave you've dug for yourself and feel what it's like to live life rather than just tolerate it.
