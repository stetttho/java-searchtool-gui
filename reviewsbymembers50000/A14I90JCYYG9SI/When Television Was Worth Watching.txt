 Before TV executives at the major networks decided that compelling storytelling and engaging character development were just too difficult and too costly, and they put a camera around your dog's neck and hoped that you would enjoy watching Spot lick himself for a few hours every night, this show was a hit, and most deservedly so.  The stories were clever, the principal actors were excellent, the supporting players were memorable, and the action sequences were engaging and believable.  Robert Conrad and Ross Martin complemented each other perfectly.  Imagine James Bond and Q as a team of secret agents in the old west and you've got the picture.  Judging from Ebay and the numerous websites devoted to this TV series, its cult of followers continues to grow, both in numbers and loyalty.  Why an entrepreneur has not packaged the show on DVD by now, like almost every other show from the 60's, is an omission of epic stupidity.  There is a cult of thousands who have been waiting years.  Look how popular and profitable "The Prisoner" is, and you have some idea of the cult surrounding WWW.  I know people who will commute across the country just to tape reruns of the show.  Why?  Watch a few episodes and you will be hooked, too.  Believe this if you can.  Despite TV ratings that  today's so-called hit shows cannot achieve, WWW was cancelled by the network due to excessive violence.  Even as a teenager, I thought this decision was utterly dumb, and so will you.  This show was and is among the best entertainment TV has ever produced, and the fact that it was taken off the air by the network rather than its lack of an audience, and the fact that 40 years later, we are still praising its merits, proves that there must be a God.
