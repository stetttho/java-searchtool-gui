 First came Goldfinger, then Diamonds Are Forever.  These are the two greatest Bond movies with Connery in the title role.  Both have great villians, and to be a great Bond movie, there must be a great villian.  Connery has never been more comfortable in the role of Bond.  He shows it all in this movie:  charm, wit, luck, indifference to authority, grace under pressure, worldliness, weariness, and humility.  Is this not one of the most fascinating characters ever portrayed on film?  I've seen every Bond film again and again.  Connery is the best Bond, because the more you think you understand about Bond, the more you feel that there is still more to know.  None of the Bond actors communicates this better than Connery.  It is what gives Bond his unpredictability, and makes you feel that you can't take your eyes off him even for a moment, because of what he might do to surprise you.  If I could own only three Bond films with Connery in the lead role, then From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, and this one, would pretty well sum up the whole series.  The rest are highly repetitive fair to poor copies.
