 Even as a spoof of James Bond and his world, Derek Flint is a superior hero.  First, this film, and its sequel, have much more humor than any Bond film yet.  Bond may lay down a few funny lines at the right moment, but Flint is witty more often, and in a more intelligent, less demeaning way. Second, Bond takes orders, Flint chooses his assignments.  This gives Flint an edginess Bond lacks.  In fact, in this film, Flint initially refuses to save the world because he's too busy conducting research or something.  Third, Bond is given gadgets by M, but Flint makes his own.  In fact, when he is asked to memorize the government's secret code, he asks the government agents to learn his code to save time (because he already knows his own code).  Finally, and most importantly, Bond wouldn't be Bond without the so-called Bond women. Flint is also constantly surrounded by admiring women, but that is not what motivates him or holds his interest and attention.  He is first a scientist and humanitarian.  All real men are whole men without the need for women to complete them.  I could go on favorably comparing Derek Flint to James Bond, but the result would be the same.  Flint is superior, and this film, and its sequel, will never lose their advantage or their audience to that other sissy.
