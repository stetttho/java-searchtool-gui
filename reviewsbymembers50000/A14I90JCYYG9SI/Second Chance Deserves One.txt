 This is not the sexiest episode in the Outer Limits series, nor is it the episode which best represents the series' enduring strengths and virtues.  It is, however, a well written, well acted, and completely enjoyable story  of a group of people who, for individual reasons, desperately need a second  chance at life after bungling their first attempt, but don't quite realize  this until they are on their way to another galaxy.
