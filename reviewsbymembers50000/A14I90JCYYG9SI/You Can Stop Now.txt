 You can now stop looking for a movie that will make you laugh out loud no matter how many times you've seen it. Used Cars is the movie, believe me.  I bought it on video in BETA format about 20 years ago, when VHS and BETA were competing to be the dominant format.  Since then, I have seen some great comedies, but none has been as much fun as Used Cars.  My respect for Kurt Russell began with this movie and he has never disappointed me.  When my boss is talking to me about some trivial work thing he thinks is important, but I couldn't care less about, it feels so good to remember some of the scenes in this movie and carry a smile in myself again.
