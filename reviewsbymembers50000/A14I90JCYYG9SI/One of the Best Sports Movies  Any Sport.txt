 One on One reminds me a lot of Hoosiers, The Natural, The Best of Times, and The Longest Yard.  It's funny, touching, inspirational, and heart-breaking.  Best of all, like these other films, it shows that one honorable man can stand tough against an army of dishonorable men and be victorious.  And, in a world that does its best to make good men do bad things just to fit in and be attractive, it's a real pleasure to see a film that shows someone doing what's right, keeping his honor, and beating the bad guys at their own game.
