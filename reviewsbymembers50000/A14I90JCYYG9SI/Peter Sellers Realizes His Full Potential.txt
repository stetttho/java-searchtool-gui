 This is one of the funniest movies ever made.  Starring Peter Sellers and a wonderful supporting cast led by Victor Mature and Martin Balsam, with a score by Burt Bacharach, and a script by Neal Simon, this is a comedy to measure other comedies by.  Every scene is memorable.  You'll be quoting dialogue forever.  I don't know why this film is overlooked by the experts, even in compiling Peter Sellers' best work, but, some people don't get it and never will.  You will never regret seeing this film, and I don't know too many people who have been able to resist seeing it more than once.  You will purchase this film.  You will enjoy it again and again.  You will praise it to everyone you know who has a sense of humor.  Trust me, I have a Ph.D. and it's not in education.
