 I purchased this clock for my visually impaired father. We both like gadgets and this was intriguing with its ability to receive short wave time broadcasts from the National Institute of Standards atomic clock in Boulder. It set its own time after a few minutes of operation. He finds it difficult to use: if he picks it up he's apt to turn on the alarm function by mistake. This was waking him up nightly at 12AM until he put it in another room. The projected time is only visible in a darkened room on the ceiling. I thought it might be able to project onto the wall behind the clock, reasonably close, and be visible during daylight. It does this, however the projected time is upside down. The designers intended for it to project on the ceiling. The projected time, in red block digits, is bright enough and large enough for him to see at night on the ceiling. This is the second Oregon Scientific product I have purchased. They build in high quality with innovative features. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this for its intended use. However if I were to purchase another clock from OS, it would be without the projection feature.
