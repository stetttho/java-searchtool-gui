 I use this for the bedroom 20inch Sony TV without external speakers. One of the first things that impressed me was the sound quality afforded by the TV's small speakers with this player. The surround sound option literally projects the sound out into the room. Sound effects like I'm only used to hearing on a home theatre system are discernable with this player. It also has a powered subwoofer output, which tempts me to buy one for this TV. Since I'm using it with just a 20inch monitor, there's not too much I can say about the picture quality: it's fine. The remote control is intuitive and easy to use (I found myself reaching for reading glasses every time I wanted to use the Philips remote for another machine). I've had no trouble playing disks, even badly scratched rentals. This player has a memory feature that allows you to resume play on a single disk after turning off the unit. This took a couple tries to figure out (not that intuitive), but I use it often.
