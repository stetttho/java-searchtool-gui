 Yeah, you know. Class of '76. Your first stereo. What to play on it? Then you here about a group that not only does thematic albums on Edgar Allen Poe, and Asimov's "I Robot" but they actually have the world "project" in their name. I'm a nerd. And I like Alan Parsons. And now we have DTS. Nirvana. All kidding aside. What we have with "On Air" is some truly melodic songs and instrumentals. With some percussion by Lockheed and Harrier thrown in. I particularly liked the throaty roar of vintage radial pistons. And while the melodies of "Tails of Mystery and Imagination" or "Pyramid" fade quickly from memory, I  found the notes from "On Air" flitting through my mind all the time. Parson's engineers have mixed this well for DTS. While taking good advantage of the format, it is not gimmicky (OK, a jet plane or 2 aside), rather the mix makes subtle use of all 5 channels plus the low end. Pleasing to hear. OK, maybe you're a fighter jock, or an astronaut.
