 Bought a new one. While it toasts bread acceptably well, the options and shade settings do not allow the degree of control necessary to toast frozen bagels (why anyone would toast fresh bagels baffles me). No amount of experimentation with the bagel setting, defrost, and varying shades would get it to come out right. In order to toast frozen bagels it's necessary to make 2 attempts. Is this nitpicking? Well yes, but for the price (new) I'd expect this device to toast, butter and serve them too! I wish I purchased the one with a simple knob.
