 My interest in "Battlefield Earth" was aroused by news of the impending movie.  So back in January '00 I looked it up on Amazon, and was amazed by the weight and number of good reviews, especially because I  had never heard of the book. The author was vaguely known to me through his  efforts peddling something called Dianetics. Caught, hook, line, and  sinker.  I'm not sure what kept me turning pages. I guess there must be  some sort of literary masochist at the center of my soul. Maybe it was  disbelief that something this bad could make it to print, and people would  buy it; I was searching for enlightenment. Didn't find it.   "Battlefield Earth" has a one dimensional plot any child could  guess. The characters have no depth. Plot devices which allow this story to  lurch toward it's conclusion are laughably shallow. The "scenery"  the author paints to describe the world circa 3000AD is as drab and  uninteresting as his characters. An alien race of blue lawyers was fun for  1 paragraph, but Hubbard draws it out for about the last 400 pages of the  book. I revere books. Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451" instilled in  me at a young age a certain awe for the concept that ideas may be printed  and passed from person to person. And that destroying these books/ideas was  inherently evil. I chucked "Battlefield Earth" in the garbage.  And then emptied used cat litter on it. Turning back to these review  pages now, I feel better about the error in my judgment. I see so many  others that made the same mistake.  I pity those who come across these  pages after the stir of interest generated by a bad movie has died down.  I'm sure by then all the reviews will be good ones.
