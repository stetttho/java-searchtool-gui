 4 stars instead of 5 as the style may not have universal appeal. But the clock is very well behaved. After pulling out the protective tabs on the battery (included) it tried to receive the time signal. It failed the first time (as expected this time of year) but by morning it had succeeded in phoning home. The alarm is a little tricky to set. It took me a minute to figure out without reading the instructions (hey I enjoy a challenge). The alarm is very polite. It starts out with a mild peep that repeats about once a second, and then builds slowly to a crescendo of beeping. It never gets loud enough to wake the dead, so if you are dead, you might want to consider another clock. The display is backlit; pressing on the light/snooze bar on the top lights its face for about 3 seconds. The display is large enough to be visible from across the room. The clock itself is constructed of thick plastic. It feels like OS has included extra weights in the base, so be careful when flinging it across the room; it may dent walls.
