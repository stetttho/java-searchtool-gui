 Prior to purchasing this I was running an HPNA network comprised of 3 PCs. 2 with win2k and diamond HPNA cards, one with win 98 and a Netgear HPNA card. Life was good. Except The PC connected to the cable modem had to be on to serve as a router using ICS so the other 2 PCs had access to the internet. Mildly annoying. Then the office let us connect via the internet using cisco VPN software. ICS and VPN dont talk to each other. Had to disable ICS (many clicks) to get VPN going. Kids would complain they couldnt access the internet. More annoying. Installed the Lynksys HPRO200 and everything booted up fine. No Muss NO Fuss. Everything talked to each other and the internet (if yours dont, its a configuration problem with your PCs not the router). Installed the firmware update (easy peasy). Dismal bandwidth. Used to get a sparkling 1.5 MBS on the PC hooked directly to the cable modem and 0.9 MBS on the others through the HPNA. With Lynksys the rates were about 30% of those. No good. Even my 6 year old complained Dad, you know nothing about computers; this is really slow. Cheeky twerp. When I was his age we had 1400baud modems. And we were glad to have them. Luckily Amazon has a great returns process. Got the 2nd Lynksys HPRO200. Hooked it up. Downloaded the firmware. Bandwidth is good, not great (thats why they only get 4 stars). Im able to get 1.2MBS on the PC hooked up to its Ethernet port, and 0.9MBS on the other PCs through the phone lines. Its still better than snaking cables and a lot less than wireless. P.S. Be sure to use a surge protector on your phone lines when using them to network. Your phone line is the easiest path for power surges to fry your PC (or at least the card its connected to).
