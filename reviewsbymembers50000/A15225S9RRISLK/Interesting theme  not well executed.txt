 While investigating an archeological site on a destroyed planet, hoping to discover ancient secrets, a small group of scientist families accidentally release a being of inconceivable evil. The few who manage to escape in a  converted freighter land on a backward planet, home of a medieval feudal  civilization. They are immediately attacked; the only survivors are their  young children. The evilness that escaped destroys entire solar systems.   A young woman, a swashbuckling adventurer with a patchwork past, and 2  helpful aliens set off to rescue the children in hopes that the secret to  destroying the evilness was sequestered aboard the children's  spacecraft. Sound good? Wait a second! The evilness is an AI  "computer virus". The medieval civilization turns out to be giant  "grouped body" rats. And the helpful aliens are potted  plants! The author is original in theme, but relies heavily on today's  popular internet devices: newsgroups, e-mail etc. Talk about bandwidth and  "bits per second" is endemic throughout. The author goes so far  as to include in "e-mails" copious amounts of routing information  stuff that even Outlook Express is friendly enough to spare showing  us. Not what I'd expect from society millions (billions?) of years from  now. And not especially entertaining.  Interesting material yes,  sometimes goofy, but not Hugo level.
