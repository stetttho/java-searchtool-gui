 I purchased one of these from another retailer (sorry Amazon), and returned it 30 days later. After 28 days it developed a disturbing habit of �freezing up� after an hour or so of playback. The only recourse at this point was to turn off the machine (directly at the unit), only to have it freeze again after a few more minutes of playback. I was sure the first time there was a problem with the DVD I was playing. However replaying a DVD that had successfully completed some days before turned up the same problem. When it worked correctly, I found the playback quality acceptable. This was used only as a 2nd DVD player for a 20-inch TV with no extra speakers, so picture and sound quality weren�t that important. The on off switch is awkward. This unit seems to be designed for the European market. Consumers there insist on an actual �mains� switch that allows them to shut of an electronic component completely, rendering the remote control useless. Yes, it goes into �standby� when �turned off� using the remote, but if you ever shut it off directly at the unit, it�s dead until turned back on from that location. A minor point I was willing to overlook, if it weren�t for the playback failure. It does have one feature that my primary DVD home theatre system does not: it remembers the last position played for the past 5 DVDs. Very useful if you stop watching before the end; it prompts you to resume where you left off when next you turn it back on.
