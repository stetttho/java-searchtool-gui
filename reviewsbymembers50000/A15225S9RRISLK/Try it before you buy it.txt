 A 30-day trial version is available for download directly from Pumatech. Then buy it from Amazon. This is the only single user software I've been able to locate which will synchronize a Palm with Lotus Notes. I got the Palm for my wife (a power user by the looks of it), but in order to be practical it had to be able to download all of her calendar from Lotus. She's not a technophile; I was afraid she'd be annoyed (she loves Franklin Planners) with buttons and wires. She loves it. But it was Intellisync that made it practical. Installing Intellisync was easy and trouble free. She has no trouble at all plugging in the Palm via its HotSync cable and hitting the synchronize button on the cable plug. Upon doing this, the Palm "wakes up" and the PC wakes up, (Lotus doesn't even have to be running!). Intellisync then begins its job of comparing the Palm's database with Lotus' and vice versa. Before updating either, it displays a report on the PC and asks for confirmation. Any conflicts are resolvable at this time (i.e. the same person's address being changed in both Lotus and the Palm, which one should be kept?) All her appointments are copied (even all day events). The same for her personal address book under Lotus, and To Do items. The Palm isn't enabled for e-mail, so this isn't an issue. The software that ships with the Palm is adequate for synchronizing with Outlook 2000. Intellisync plus the Palm allow her to synchronize Lotus Notes at work with Outlook at home. We only had to purchase an extra HotSync cable. The details: Palm m100; HotSync serial cable; Intellisync 4.0; Lotus Notes R5 (5.0.2a); Windows 95 running on Gateway 300mhz Pentium.
