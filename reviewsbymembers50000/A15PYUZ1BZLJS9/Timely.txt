 After scanning the customer reviews I was delighted to see almost all of them favorable because I was afraid I would be in a minority of people who saw this as an antidote to the stereotyping of Islam now going on among some Franklin Graham "Christians." America needed this book right now. Hosseini's Moslem characters are not only individuals but for the most part lovable and intelligent people, just as all of us humans should be.   I read a lot so I am qualified to tell you: This is a very, very good book.
