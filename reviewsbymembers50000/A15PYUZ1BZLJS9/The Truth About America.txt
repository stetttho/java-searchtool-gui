 The truth is I am ashamed of my country because there are people who will buy and read this book. What a reflection on the ignorance and meanness of a good part of our nation! I don't understand the people who say they hate America. I would ask them, "Which America are you talking about?" There are so many Americas. Sadly, there is the America of the haters and this book is a good example of that America.  I don't know Mr. Klein but I do know that when someone sets out to write about a subject, that person researches the subject matter. Mr. Klein did no such thing but sought out any negative things said about his subject matter and then put them in his cut and paste garbage heap. The cynicism of the publisher just astounds me.
