 Dear Mr. Albom, Please tell me you didn't publish this wretched book. One of my favorite books was "Tuesdays with Morrie," your book also, and now this. It's not even a good Tom Swifty. It probably took more time for me to read it than it did for you to write it.  I think too much of you to want anyone to buy this book. I hope I can wave people off from buying it. It hurts your reputation.   I ask you, "What would Morrie think of this trash?"
