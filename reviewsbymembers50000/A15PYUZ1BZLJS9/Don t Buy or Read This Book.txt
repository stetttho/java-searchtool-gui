 In the words of Frank McCourt, I don't "give a fiddler's fart" about his sex life. This book tries to be cute right up until Chapter 18 when Frank says, "I'll try" in answer to someone's suggestion that he should write a book.   It's not amusing to make fun of students, their parents and other teachers. It's not good writing to use the same voices for all of his students over 30 years. It's not entertaining to stereotype everyone who crosses his path.   What "Teacher Man" does is to cash in on the popularity of "Angela's Ashes." He blithely offends people right and left but gets away with it by playing the Irish card.   This book is a disappointing bore out of what could have been an interesting look into what it is like to teach for 30 years in a city like New York, a city which deserved much better from him.
