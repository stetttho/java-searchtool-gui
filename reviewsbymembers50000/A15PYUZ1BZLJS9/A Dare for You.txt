 First I want to thank all the reviewers ahead of me, who got it right and made me want to buy it and read it.  Then I want to challenge you. I dare you to read this book. If it doesn't make you weep and curse, then you aren't much good. I take issue, though, with the reviewers who criticized religion as part of the solution to the horror of it all. Two thousand years ago, people still believed in magic. There were no hospitals. Slavery abounded and was taken for granted. Women had no rights. Children were merely possessions and illness was considered punishment or the work of demons.  Dr. Paul Farmer, M.D., and others like him who are changing this world view are the heirs of belief in God, a God who prefers the poor and with good reason, as this book will show you.   Go ahead and read it. I dare you.
