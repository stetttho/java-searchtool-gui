 To paraphrase the man from Lake Worth, Florida, I am a social worker by training, an anthropologist by wishful thinking, a voyeur of human behavior by necessity and a Catholic by good fortune.   Losing Jaynes to the  intellectual world was an irreplaceable loss.  He touched every base.  I  wish he had looked more carefully at mimetic behavior as does the  anthropologist Rene Girard at Stanford. I wish he might have noted that  Catholicism is still evolving and is well able to incorporate new insights  such as his own.  I know it's a young religion but from its beginning,  Catholicism has offered a universal theory:  Christ fulfills all human  yearnings and ties together all the myths ever known.   Despite his  brilliance, Dr. Jaynes might perhaps have recognized how much his Unitarian  upbringing steered him towards his conclusions, just as my Catholic  education has colored my own view of the universe.  I am grateful to Dr.  Jaynes for what he has shown me.  I only hope he would have forgiven me for  putting my own spin on it.
