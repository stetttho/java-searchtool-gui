 I have read this book three times.  Every time I wish to send a gift to a Catholic friend, this is what I send.  Why?  Because it is loaded with the best stuff the Catholic Church has to offer.  That may be a drawback.  It is unlikely that readers who aren't Catholic would be familiar with many of the experts on prayer who are quoted and interpreted. Persons who aren't Catholic, however,  who are seeking to grow in their spiritual life, will have a hard time finding a more useful method to pray the psalms than what is offered here. The entire Bible, of course, is presented as our first source for prayer and meditation, but the specifically Catholic traditions may be offputting to some.  For over a year now, ever since I read this book for the first time, I have been spending an hour with God in the morning before I do anything else. It has changed my life.
