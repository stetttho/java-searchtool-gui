 There are still men on this planet who are willing to die for what they believe. Many of those men are Jesuits. This is a rare chance to look deeply inside their world. If you are a Catholic, you will be very happy that your ancient faith can still be rational and heroic, even in these times. If you are not Catholic, you will be entertained by a very good story of three interesting men, one of them gay, who, apart and together, live heroic lives far beyond what they expected when they first became Jesuits. They are "like combat buddies" because they went through Jesuit training together. It's a different world from anyone else's, a world more fully revealed in A JESUIT'S TALE than anywhere I have ever seen. It is also a suspense-filled adventure story that works on many levels: physically, spiritually and emotionally. This is a stunning achievement for a first novel. I can't wait for the author's next book. Shekleton has a unique and wonderful voice. I was enriched and entertained at the same time. You can't ask for more from any book.
