 This is a masterpiece and unique of its kind.  William Blake?  (August 12)  Flannery O'Connor?  (August 3)  Mary, Mother of Jesus (January 1).  There are 365 of them and the vignettes are thoroughly researched.  Ellsberg writes like an angel.  Cheez, where has this Ellsberg been all my life?  This is a "vade-mecum" if there ever was one.  I can't wait to see it every morning.  In his Frontispiece, he quotes Thomas Merton (December 10), "There is no way of telling people that they are all walking around shining like the sun."  Robert Ellsberg has sure got me looking.
