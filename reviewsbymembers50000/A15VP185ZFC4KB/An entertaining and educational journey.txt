 Feiler takes the reader on a field trip through the Bible, cooking up a delightful smorgasboard of theology, history, archeaology, geography, storytelling, religions, and wisdom.  The way he is able to weave all of these scholarly pursuits together is insightful and inspirational, letting the reader enjoy the journey from home while simultaneously soaking up a great deal of knowledge.  Much better than listening to Aunt Bertha's vacation slide presentation!  This book will definitely give you a new appreciation for the Bible.  It seems Feiler's project may have started out as a personal project which eventually evolved into this wonderful book.  He says in the text that the idea for the book snuck up on him, saying that "suddenly, almost overnight, I wanted these words (i.e., the words found within the Bible) to have meaning again, to understand them."  Those words definitely resonated with me, because that was the same inspiration that I had when writing my own book (A New Beginning by Eric Westra).  He took an entirely different path of execution than I did, taking a trek of thousands and thousands of miles to be able to experience the territory firsthand in order to be able to give a better personal context to the first five books of the Bible.  He writes, "I hoped this effort might deepen my appreciation of the stories by freeing them from their covers and replanting them in the ground."  And so if you want to be able to glean this type of wisdom without having to actually take this type of journey on your own, pick up a copy of this book and join Feiler and Avner and others on this incredible and entertaining trek.  In fact, pick up this book as well as my own (Eric Westra, A New Beginning) if you would like to have both sides of your brain sparked in re-igniting your passion for the Old Testament.
