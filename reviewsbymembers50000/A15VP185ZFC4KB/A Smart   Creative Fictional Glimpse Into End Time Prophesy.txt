 I have read the first two books of The Christ Clone Trilogy, not to mention the first two books of the way-too-drawn-out-by-their-marketing-department Left Behind Series.  While I am not sure whether or not to spend the time finishing the Left Behind series (I suppose I might, though I can't say I would highly recommend it to anyone), I will though, without a doubt, be reading book three of The Christ Clone Trilogy (I already have it on order, in fact).      Before I started reading the first book I was prepared to swallow something patronizing, prosaic, pedantic, and phlegmatic.  It is, of course, none of these things.  In fact, I became pleasantly surprised to find a fantastic cauldron of storytelling intrigue, bubbling over with all the complexities of science fiction and prophesy, wit and wisdom, creativity and intellect.      I try to spend much of my spare time reading, which sometimes can feel like a chore, but this series has stirred up some excitement within me that I haven't experienced since Eco's "Foucault's Pendulum" or maybe Rand's "Atlas Shrugged".  I've even found myself trying to read a few pages while driving on the way to work (a risky task which I would not recommend doing obviously).      I'm surprised that a major publisher hasn't snatched this up yet!  I never would have expected something this good from a Republican.  (I've already been forgiven for that last remark).  Anyway, I highly recommend all three books, which says a lot, since I'm only a hundred pages into the third one.  Great stuff.
