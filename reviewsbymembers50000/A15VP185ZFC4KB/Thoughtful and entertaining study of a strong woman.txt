 This is an entertaining story of the life of Sarah, a woman who is portrayed as intelligent, strong, and faithful.  The way in which Card weaves the storyline is creative, and I must admit that I found myself much more comfortable with the content of this book compared to Diamant's Red Tent, and the style of writing is almost as good as Diamant's too.  I recommend both books, but this book is probably more appropriate for those that might be offended by the slightly irreverent nature of Diamant's work.  I liked the way that Card ended the novel, however I did wish he would have added at least one more chapter, so that the reader might see how Sarah could have possibly reacted upon the return of Abraham and Isaac from Moriah.  I understand why he didn't include this, partly because of the difficulty it would have posed, and partly because at the end of the story, we know Sarah so well that the reader can run the scenario through his or her own mind.  Oh, and I should also mention that I felt a bit of guilty pleasure in seeing Lot's wife disappear from the pages of the book. [...]
