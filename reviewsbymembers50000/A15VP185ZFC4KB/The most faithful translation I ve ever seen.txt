 As a fellow author having also probed the layers of meaning within the Torah (ERIC WESTRA, A NEW BEGINNING, 2000:  Buy it!), I must say that I am in awe.  This book was an invaluable resource as I did research for my own book.  Anyone with a scholarly interest in these first books of the bible should get a hold of Fox's book immediately.  Thank you, Mr. Fox.
