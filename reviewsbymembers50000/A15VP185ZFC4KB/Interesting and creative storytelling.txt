 Diamant paints an almost surreal landscape of the ancient civilization within which Dinah resides.  She did an excellent job making the reader comfortable with a culture that is ancient and foreign.  I was even privy to the mysteries and secrets of life within the red tent, the place where women go during that time of the month, and also the place where life begins.  Birthing, blood, breastfeeding, and gossip fill the pages, but this male reader enjoyed the storytelling regardless. It is clever the way in which Diamant uses the Genesis narratives as a springboard for Dinah's story.  At points her perspective comes off as being entirely different, even contrary, to the traditional interpretation.  This will infuriate some strict fundamentalist Christians (but some of these supposedly angered individuals will secretly continue reading the book to the very end regardless).  Jewish readers probably won't get as easily offended, because they are familiar with midrash, storytelling based upon familiar narratives, which is precisely what this is. A note for the more sensitive reader:  Keep in mind that this is a work of fiction.  Even I was a bit irritated that the women didn't take their husband's god (El) a bit more seriously than their household gods.  However, she did do an excellent job in portraying a confusing world in which superstition and silly pagan practices were much more widespread than most people would think.     I enjoyed this book as much as I did Orson Scott Card's book, Sarah, and Joseph Heller's book about David (I think it's called Dear God).  Another creative re-presentation of various parts of Genesis can also be found in my book A NEW BEGINNING by Eric Westra.
