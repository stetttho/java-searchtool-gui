 As a biblical scholar and as an author who has also taken a long look at the book of Genesis (Eric Westra, "A New Beginning", 2000), I am well aware of the complexities and subtle nuances found within the text of Genesis.  I was very impressed with Armstrong's firm grasp of the biblical text with all of its complexities, while at the same time never coming across as being pedantic, obtuse, or closed-minded.  Armstrong opened my mind to things I had not previously considered.  To anyone interested in probing the layers of meaning that can be found beyond a simple reading of Genesis, I highly recommend this book.
