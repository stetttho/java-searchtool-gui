 For those with an open mind and a thirst for new Biblical insights, this book is a delight.  It is just what you might expect from a brilliant legal mind, and more.  Alan Dershowitz shares his research and analysis in an engaging and entertaining style on a subject for which he obviously has a tremendous passion. Maimonides, Soren Kierkegaard, Abraham Ibn Ezra, Franz Kafka, Blaise Pascal, Everett Fox, and Bob Dylan are just a small handful of the voices invited to the party.  The genius of this work is that while it presents so many different viewpoints (without necessarily adopting one "correct" interpretation over another), Dershowitz is still able to clearly show the reader that within the complex and confusing assortment of narratives that is Genesis, there exists a straightforward path toward the Law.  This path, while full of injustice along the way, does not merely show us the need for the Law;  it shows a developing legal system in process. No matter how familiar you may think you are with the book of Genesis, you will be able to experience the narratives afresh.  Dershowitz holds up the book of Genesis like a crystal in sunlight, its beauty seen in the reflections of light, observed at a number of different angles.
