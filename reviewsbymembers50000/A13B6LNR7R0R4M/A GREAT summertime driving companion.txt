 I wrote a review for The Rurals album, "Messages" as being the perfect driving companion on those warm and sunny blue sky days. But... in case you want to further your journey with more of the same, this will be the album to continue with.  Emotional Feelings is packed with some groovy house tunes and a sexy and soulful collage of music that will make your drive and your day, full on an empty stomach.  The Rurals are that rare breed of musicians who create albums and songs that bridge talent with emotion. And I have never heard of such clarity and good spirited music from any musician who was able to be consistant with such ability, within the genre of house music.  The Rurals are truly a rare and priceless breed that must be honored and adualted to the Nth Degree.  And this album will testify to that.
