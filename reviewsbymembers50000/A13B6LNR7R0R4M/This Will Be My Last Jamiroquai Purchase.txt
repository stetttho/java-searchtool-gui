 I can no longer support a group that won't make the effort in expanding and trying different things. Unlike the original incarnation of Jamiroquai...long gone are the days of the crew who were more than just an eclectic group of musicians and imaginative, natural born talents. Now, Jamiroquai has become just another group in passing, painstakingly trying to recapture it's gloys days of the early 90's.  Yet, Dynamite isn't a total disaster. It's highlights include Seven Days In Sunny June, Feels Just Like It Should and Talullah.  However, it's difficult to ignore it's bad points. The songwriting is probably the worst i've heard since j.lo's 'rebirth' album, which i find to be very surprising since jay has always been an excellent writer.  Then there's the music. I have grown sick and tired of their crappy and overly repetative disco/techno hybird sound. It was a neat vibe they jumped off with on synchonized, but then... they took it past it's expiration date on 'A Funk Odyssey' and, then... semi-reheated it on this album.  It's almost as if Jamiroquai isn't quite sure where to take it's direction in music anymore... whereas, it was instantanious in it's early years when ingenuity and imagination allowed jamiroquai to become the litmus test in modern day music.  The hunger is no longer there. The passion is no longer there. They jumped the shark, became rock stars and Jamiroquai has clearly run it's course. And although I'm done supporting them, the memories of thier great catalog of music still remains golden.
