 What a let down this album is. It took 10 years for another great singer to release a new album. An album filled with painfully dated material. Anita does what she does best with her heavy but sultry singing. But the problem here is that she has been stuck in a time capsule since 1994. It's as almost as if nothing has inspired her over the past decade to try something different or experimental for the 21st century. Not that she's required to do so. But sometimes, the best quality of an artist is his or her ability to grow and change into different aspects of thier sound and style. Here, Anita just doesn't do this.  Honestly, if you want to hear this new album from Anita, your better off saving your money and just rotate what you already have in your Anita collection.
