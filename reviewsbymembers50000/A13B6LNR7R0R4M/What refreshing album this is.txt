 Cover to cover, this album is pure bliss folks. Some of the best Soul and Jazz music was orchestrated and sequenced to perfection on Dayafter. Also, Deborah's band 'Third Logic' are simply bliss! Musically, they have a close kinship with Sweetback (Sade's band)... and leave you with a wonderful gooey feeling inside with the combination of thier infectious melodic jazz riffs and Deborah's soulstirring singing.  BY ALL MEANS, BUY THIS ALBUM PEOPLE! I promise you! If you are a fan of Sade, Jill Scott and Sweetback...this album is definately for you.
