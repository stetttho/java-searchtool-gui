 After seven long years, Nomadic is not what i expected from her. Although it does has a smattering of elements from her first album, there are quite a few surprises that has either moved the "airy'nesense" of my moods or placed me in a state of flatlined boredom.  From the moment the intro drops, I had already started to feel a sense of contrived attributes in the album. Adriana holds a mock interview with an unnamed person talking about the different kinds of music she grew up with.  ****************************************************************  Dude: so what kind of music you grew up listening to?  Adriana: oh i listen to everything. like rock, soul, afro-cuban salsa, brazilian samba...  Dude: WORD?  Adriana: yeah i mean its was just all in my house just everywhere you look there was music ya know, um  Dude: all that stuff just kinda, kinda comes out when you do...  Adriana: oh yeah im good to do like a afro latin rock song you know?  Dude: WORD!?  Adriana: its just...just....you know its its all the same thing to me  Dude: THAT'S INCREDIBLE!  ****************************************************************  DUDE! ...SHUT UP! i literally wanted to reach through the earbuds on my i-pod and strangle the guy who was on embellishment overkill with the "word?" and the "that's incredible" comments.  nevertheless, the album rolls on along into the second track....  - Remember Love: This song opens the album with a nice piece of music with a tropical island twist that is refreshing, sweet and blissful.  - Through His Eyes: Another airy piece of music that keeps the pace of the mood where the prior left off. Good song.  - In Search of: A decent song, but repetitive and not very inspiring. Boring, if you will.  - What It Is: This track is reminiscent of 70's bluesy/funk/rock music. A good sound but somewhat misplaced in the scheme of the airy mood the album started me off with.  - Something: Another bluesy, funk track that can be addictive and infectious after a few rotations in the car with the volume in high decibels.  - I Had A Dream: The music is great, but the song itself sounds like filler.   - Midnight In Bahia: I like the haunting mood this track has attached to it. But Adriana hits writers block with this song. More filler.  - 7 Days: This is a GREAT, great track right here. Once again, it's reminiscent of 70's Rock/funk band WAR. Definately worth rotating on repeat while driving at high velocity at 2am on the highway.  - Morning Light: This is a nice song by Adriana. Pretty piano playing, but sounds constricted to one pattern of melody.  - I Hear Music: The music on this song brings the mood back to where the album initially started you off with. Airy, heartfelt 'sunny' feelings. But again, Adriana hits writers block on this track.  - Rollin' On: What I love about this song is Adriana's opinion on the current state of music as well as her passion to continue making what she feels is music in it's true essence. Good song.  - Former Self: This is another great song by Adriana. Far more inspirational than 'In Search Of'. And I like the reggae elements in the music. This was a good song to end the album with.  Overall, Nomadic is the kind of album you would want to take with you to the Bahamas, on a cruise or maybe to the beach on a sunny, warm day. The album is filled with various musical elements from the islands along with a few moments of edgy funk and bluesy sounds as well. So altogether it has a nice blend of everything.  The only real problem i have with the album is the limited range the music doesn't overcome. Although, I enjoy much of the music on the album.... one would think that if an artist spent so much of their time during their hiatus in different countries, soaking up different sounds and moods in music...they would return to songwriting with more of an eclectic, instrumental and "inprovisonational" range in their music. I also would have loved to hear Adriana with other producers aside from dredd scott. He's a good beat maker and producer. But to hear the true nature of Adriana's voice, I think the matching of her talents laced alongside those of different producers will showcase her as being more than what she appears to be and sounds.  Otherwise, the album is a very good follow up to her first.  But do not expect a part 2 of her debut album, in Nomadic. The edgier music will throw you for a loop if you ride your expectations on what you know of Adriana from the first album. So you will have to dumb down those expectations and keep an extremely open ear to Nomadic.  If you can do that, then i recommend that you do not pass this gem up.
