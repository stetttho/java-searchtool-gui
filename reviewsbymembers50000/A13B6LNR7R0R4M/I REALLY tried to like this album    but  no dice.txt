 This album is a prime example of having great music combined with weak, childlike songwritting. It infuriates me when you have great producers like James Poyser and the legendary Bob Power create instant magic with thier music and have an unknown singer singlehandedly soil the fabric of that magic. This album is so bad that I had to desperatley find a reason to not slit my writs after reaching the end of the album. And what gives with the missing 13th track on the CD?   Rhian's voice is too heavy and overcompensates the melodic sound on this album. She may be easy on the eyes, but looks go a long way when it balls down to talent.
