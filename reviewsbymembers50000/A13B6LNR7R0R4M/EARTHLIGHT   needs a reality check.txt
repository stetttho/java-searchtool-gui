 The previous reviewer Earthlight66 clearly has no clue on what they are talking about. He/she ranted and spewed so much hate on Rage's music that it was difficult to read whether if they were doing a review, or simply showcasing thier ego as if they know everything. Rage was one of the most important and influential rock bands to emerge since the 60's. On 'The Battle of Los Angeles', Rage's infectious guitar riffs and revolutionary drum rhythms demanded everyone's undivided attention towards messages that were necessary and critical. Zach de la Rocha speaks on modern day ills that have infiltrated our society and corrupted the fabric of our intelligence. Considering that the direction of thier message on 'The Battle of Los Angeles' was political, it was an attempt to disconnect society from the matrix of corrupt governments. These are messages that forces us to take the 'red pill' and go deep into the 'rabbit hole' to seek out the truth of what has been exaggerated from falsehoods that have been instilled in all of us since childhood. Yet, there are always those (earthlight 66) who choose to take the 'blue pill' and fight their way from wanting to understand the truth from a point of view that is unorthodox to thier reality. These are the same people who bathe in thier own arrogance, where they assume to know what Tom Morello's intentions were when he recorded with Rage. These are people who actually believe that they can mysteriously read the minds of musicians and think that they are trying to commit some kind of socioligical genocide with thier messages. People like Earthlight66 are so consumed with thier arrogance and ignorance that they refuse to look outside of thier 'box' and beyond thier personal limitations to find alternatives to what they believe to be 'the truth'. My friend, neither Tom nor Zach nor any member of Rage claim to know the answers to the problems that affect our society. They merely are expressing thier 1st amendment right to speak what they believe in and what they desire to share and leave open for CONSTRUCTIVE interpretation, and not futile tantrums. So Earthlight 66, the next time you decide to write a 'review', make sure YOU understand what your talking about and please, back up your arguements with FACTS instead of egotistical ranting and complaining. Otherwise, you will end up making yourself sound like a bitter individual who cares about nothing except hearing your own voice.        Otherwise, I HIGHLY recommend that EVERYONE needs to cop The Battle of Los Angeles, as well as ALL of Rage's albums. And to listen closely to the message that is important for all to hear. In the end, YOU are the one to decide whether if thier message is in FACT, true or false, right or wrong. Don't allow the ignorance of the few decide your interpretation of this phenomenal music, for you.
