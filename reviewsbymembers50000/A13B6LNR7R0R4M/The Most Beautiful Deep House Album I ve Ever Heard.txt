 If you ever are looking for the perfect music companion to take along with you for a drive on those warm and sunny blue sky days, in the countryside, or to the beach... THIS is the perfect album to take with you. And nothing more.  I was first introduced to The Rurals two years ago with this album. It was the perfect entry into the effervesent talents and imagination of a group that deserves so much more adulation and accolades.  From cover to cover, this album escretes melodic and syrupy soulful magic that keeps you locked in a sunny, feel good state of mind and spirit. And the sweetness of Marie's singing voice is the scent of a fresh garden that completes the beauty of such an album.  I highly recommend this piece of genius. Do not hesitate. Do not waiver. Because I guarantee, if you are looking for that perfect sunny, saturday afternoon driving music, THIS is it!
