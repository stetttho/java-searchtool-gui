 I purchased this dictionary because a previous reviewer wrote that it was of the Egyptian dialect.  I found to my disappointment that it is in fact Modern Standard Arabic. But that does not take away from the usefulness of the dictionary.  The pictures are cute, and the words are displayed in both Arabic script and roman transliteration (western alphabet).  The book also includes an in-depth pronounciation guide for the Arabic script, but no guide is offered to explain the transliterations.  Overall, this is an great beginner's book for acquiring basic Arabic vocabulary and developing basic reading skills of the Arabic script.
