 These tapes are great!  If you are like me, you use flash cards as the most efficient way to master foreign language vocabulary.  Wouldn't it be great to have AUDIO FLASH CARDS so that you could learn not only the written form of each word, but the sound as well?  That is precisely what Vocabulearn offers.  Level 1 includes 2 cassettes, and each side covers a specific part of speech: nouns, adjectives/adverbs, verbs and useful expressions.  The first half of each side is English/Arabic. A woman's voice pronounces a word in English followed seconds later by a man's voice pronouncing the corresponding Arabic.  The later part of each side is Arabic/English with the man beginning in Arabic, and the woman providing an English translation for each word or phrase.  A small pamphlet is included that provides the English/Arabic and Arabic/English words and translations in written form.  Both the Arabic script and Arabic transliteration are included. The recordings are crystal clear, and they are accompanied by intermittent snatches of classical music. The music is very soothing, and it helps me reach a relaxed, focused state of mind. I like to listen to the tapes at night before sleep since they not only help me assimilate the vocabulary, but they also help me unwind from the stress of the day. The Saudi dialect is used on these tapes, which is very similar to Modern Standard. The main exception seems to be the pronunciation of the Arabic letter qaaf as a hard "g" (as in good).   I highly recommend Vocabulearn Learn Arabic: Music Enhanced Language Program Level 1. But don't waste your money on the Level 2.
