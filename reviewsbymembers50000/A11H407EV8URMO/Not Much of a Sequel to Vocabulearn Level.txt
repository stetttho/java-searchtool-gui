 If you have read my review of Vocabulearn: Learn Arabic Level 1, you know that I gave it 5 stars, and raved about its usefulness.  Unfortunately, Level 2 was a huge disappointment.  The quality and format have not changed, but the usefulness of the words and phrases are questionable.  Many of the phrases have the feel of tired cliches. For example, Level 2 includes the following expressions: "They are out of spare parts" and "He enlisted at nineteen" and "Cheaper by the dozen" just to list a few.  I can't imagine anyone needing to know phrases like that by rote in Arabic.  The nouns and adverbs and adjectives are not quite that bad, but most are definitely not among the 1000 most common words one would need to know to survive in Arabic. On the up side, many of the nouns are useful, and the quality of the recorded voices is first class.  Also, the classical music enhancement is awesome. This may be an excellent tool for a very serious student of Arabic.  But for the average learner, who wants to quickly acquire a high level of proficiency with the language, it would be better to stick to Vocabulearn: Learn Arabic Level 1.
