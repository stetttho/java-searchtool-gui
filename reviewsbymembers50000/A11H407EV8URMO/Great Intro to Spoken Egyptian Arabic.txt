 I bought several tape/book sets to prepare for my trip to Egypt, and Getting By in Arabic was by far the best of the lot.  The lessons are clear and easy to follow, and the speakers are easy to emulate.  There is enough repetition of words and phrases to make the material stick without much effort, and without becoming boring. This is an excellent place to begin your studies of Arabic.  I had no knowledge at all of the language before using these lessons, and now I have the confidence to practice what I have learned when I encounter native speakers!
