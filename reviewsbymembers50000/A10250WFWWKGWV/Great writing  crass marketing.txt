 My relatively low rating refers strictly to the marketing methods used to promote this book.  The title and blurbs suggest this is a collection of wild tales from freaky Florida.  They are actually touching and thoughtful, even poetic essays from someone who lives there, finds it beautiful and takes the bad with the good.  Ironically, more than one of the essays pokes fun at publicists and marketing types.
