 I can see why some are trying so hard to discredit this book and discourage any from reading it; it gives feminists a lot to answer for.  Consider the following passage regarding followers of feminist ideology:  "Their sensitivities were being sharpened to such an edge that some were turned into relentless grievance collectors or rendered too suspicious to function in the workaday world outside of Women's Studies and were left with few possible roles in life beyond that of angry feminists."  (p.86 )  This is the perfect illustration of she who posts a review she didn't write for a book she didn't read.  Maybe what we are seeing is a kind of coming of age for women.  They've been taken care of by men for so many generations and now they are expected to make their own way in the world.   Just as teenagers often go to great lengths to establish their independence at a certain age; some women feel the need to lash out at what they see as the vestiges of male domination.  What they wind up doing, though, is directing most of their venom at the men who deserve it least but are most willing to put up with it.  What women should be doing is examining the philosophical implications of choosing their own destinies.  One can not have one's cake and eat it too.  That is not a limitation placed on women by men; it is a simple fact of the universe we live in.  Generations of kept women have demanded that their men work harder and earn more so that proverbial cake could be both eaten and had.  Their men responded by working themselves to death.  Today's feminists are demanding more government to give them the things they think they deserve.  The world cannot survive more experiments in Socialism.  Ladies, it's time to wrap up the adolescent thing and start acting like the adults you claim to be.
