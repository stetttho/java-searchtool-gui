 A National Geographic effort, Weeping Camel is just staged enough to provide a concise "week-in-the-life" storyline while retaining a documentary sense of authenticity.  You will see elements of the family's lifestyle that are clearly rooted in centuries old tradition alongside adaptations to elements of modern technology. Weeping Camel is a fun movie to watch with children who can't imagine the "horrors" of life without constant electronic entertainment. My copy was subtitled but it DOES require the user to turn the option on under menu options.
