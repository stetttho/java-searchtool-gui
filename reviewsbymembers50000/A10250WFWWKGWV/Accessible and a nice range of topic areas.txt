 Part of the "Politically correct guide to..." series, Tom Bethell looks at AIDS, the Environment, Evolution, Nuclear Power, Cancer, DDT and other topics currently under "scientific" study.  All by itself, this book will not make any converts.  There are too many passages that lapse into emotive language that would lead the curious liberal to snap the book shut in digust. But the "P.I.G. to Science" would be an excellent desk reference for any conservative active in debates and education efforts regarding these issues.  It is full of book recommendations (amusingly referred to as books you are not supposed to read)such as Lomborg's "The Skeptical Environmentalist." The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science offers the other side of issues considered closed on today's college campuses.  For this "heresy" alone it deserves 4 stars.
