 This collection of essays is interesting in a pretentious and foppish way; perfect for the boheme grad student haunting the halls of the English dept.  These essays are, with some exceptions, stream of conscious meanderings, that become tiresome. For those who really enjoy Lethem's fiction and might be interested in a glimpse at his creative process, I recommend "Men and Cartoons."
