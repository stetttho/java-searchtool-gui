 "The Undercover Economist" is supposed to be a fun and accessible discussion of economics as it relates to social issues.  Not so much.  It is bad enough that the author tries too hard to be cute.  Economics can be painfully dry but plenty of authors have found ways to make it fun.  Harford's efforts to liven up what he has to say fall a bit flat.  What I found more disappointing was Harford's approval for redistributive policies.  While they always sound great in theory, such policies are always impossible to administer fairly or soundly and always generate more problems than they solve. "Undercover" would have been a stronger work had the author focused on fundamentals and left the more advanced topics out.
