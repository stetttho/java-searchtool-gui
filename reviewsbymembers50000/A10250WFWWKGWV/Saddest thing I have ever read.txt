 I seldom read fiction and when I do it is usually spy or detective stories.  I read this because the description reminded me of my wife and I.  It is painfully, PAINFULLY sad but very good.  Tyler has a true gift for creating characters and places and bringing them along over years and decades.  I am sure her other works are well crafted but I don't think I could stand to feel this way again if I could possibly help it.
