 First of all, everyone should realize that Keillor may have some nominal connection to Minnesota and the Midwest, but he is, at heart, an Upper West Side Manhattan Limousine liberal and a self-promoter.  Continuing in the role he began in "Home Grown: he has anointed himself "The Old Scout" in a weekly newspaper column taking advantage of the boosterism of the local newspaper.  They give him a soapbox not for his keen insight into world affairs but because he is a nationally known, though narrowly enjoyed, entertainer.  When he does come to Minnesota, he lives on St. Paul's Summit Avenue, the tiny enclave of Minnesota's "old money" and a 5 minute ride by limo to the airport.  Keillor's fantasies of a simpler time when people helped each other are sometimes heartwarming.  But people should realize that while Midwesterners are very nice to each other for the most part, it does not follow that we all see tax and spend liberalism as the answer to the world's problems.  It is shameful how Keillor dances between the roles of entertainer and political commentator.  It is infuriating how Keillor seeks to portray rural Midwesterners as natural advocates of his brand of socialism when, in reality, they are staunch Red-staters held hostage to Blue Metro areas.
