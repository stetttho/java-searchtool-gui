 My suspicion that this film was mainly a "rah rah" piece for the U.N. is shared by several of my fellow reviewers.  I hope that is the case so any who put work into "The Interpreter" can say they at least accomplished something.  A really good spy thriller will maintain a nagging sense in the back of your mind that there is something amiss but keeps the action coming so you won't have an idle moment to ponder it.  At the very end, the final piece of the puzzle will drop into place just in time to roll credits.  In this movie, that nagging detail is so glaringly obvious that a non-stop chase scene couldn't mask it and there are no chase scenes in this movie worthy of the name.  Staggering coincidences are required every few minutes to keep the plot moving.  When the details of the nefarious conspiracy are revealed, the viewer is left thinking "really, that's it? They went to all that trouble for that?"
