 This is a great slice of Americana, a true "Period Piece."  Sinatra was a competent actor and probably could have paid the bills this way even if he hadn't been a remarkably talented singer.  It's not everybody who can pull off a menacing tough-guy when he weighs 118 soaking wet.  This film presents itself in stark tones both visually and thematically.  Patriotism, courage, honor, sacrifice.  The words necessary to make that into a sentence would only sully the higher meaning; and that's the feeling you get as you watch this film.  It is sparse, but self-assured.  Think of it as the lost episode of "The Andy Griffith Show."
