 Moral Politics is written in the language of liberals.  It is a lengthy rationalization of how liberals reconcile their stated beliefs with their actual day-to-day choices.  George Lakoff rates things like aesthetic appreciation and capacity to experience pleasure near the top of the list of important civic attributes.    His "insights" about conservative thinking are profoundly misinformed.  He really should talk to a conservative once in a while though I can see how awkward that would be for both parties.  The passage below, found on p. 32 deserves to be quoted in full:  "It is important that the public become aware that we think by using conceptual systems that are not immediately accessible to consciousness and that conceptual metaphor is part of our normal thought processes."  You see not only do we think with systems inaccessible to our consciousness (?!), but also it is important that the public become aware of this.   You will not find a better illustration of how liberals and conservatives differ in the ways they think about public matters.  A liberal has on his list of things to do making the public aware that we think by using inaccessible sytems.  Try dropping the above quote into ordinary conversation (off-campus please)sometime.  Chart the fortunes of the Democratic Party in the depth and profundity of the blank look you receive.
