 If you are looking for the proverbial "fly on the wall" perspective of the White House, this might fit the bill nicely.  Christie gives a very...accessible account of what it's like to work for the President.  Unfortunately, Christie's experiences (as he presents them anyway) come across as though he had about as much impact on meaningful policy as a real fly on the wall.  Certain passages made me cringe as the author described being nearly paralyzed with awe every time he met high profile people for the first time.    I surely hope this was an editing error that slipped through but on page 233 Christie describes Karl Rove as being "thought by many to be the most powerful man in the White House other than the VP".  If that was supposed to be a dig at Bush it's pretty unbecoming considering the way Christie fawns over W through the rest of the book.  I STRONGLY suspect a junior proof-reader at publisher Nelson Current let her political views enter into her work and introduced the error as a prank.  Pretty funny.  I wouldn't recommend this for those learning about politics, government and the executive branch either.  It is too lean on how various departments and individuals work together to implement policy.  Also lacking is any insight on how one gets to such a position.
