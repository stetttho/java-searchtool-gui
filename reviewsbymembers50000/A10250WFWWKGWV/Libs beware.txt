 This book is full of scary equations that will make your head hurt and confuse you.  Okay, they're gone.  Now, all you right-thinking conservatives take note.  This book is well thought of by the NYT but don't let that put you off.  It is a well presented examination of how economics can be used to explore social issues.  Freakonomics rightly shows that economics is the study of human decisions (and not, as liberals claim, the study of how to balance one's checkbook.)  The authors address social questions in ways that liberals will find blasphemous.  Liberals are notorious for using dubious "facts" to advocate policies which redirect resources away from those who've shown they can use them to maximum public advantage and toward those who've shown they will squander them.  Freakonomics exposes their slight of hand.  You may not agree with every implication of Freakonomics but you will respect the rigorous analysis with which the authors attack their subjects.  Once you've enjoyed your copy, leave it in a coffee shop near the local State University.  You just might help a journalism and social justice major begin her deprogramming.
