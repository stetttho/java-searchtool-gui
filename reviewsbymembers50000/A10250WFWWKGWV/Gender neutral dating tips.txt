 I know this book was not aimed at guys.  I found it in the humor section and even though it was not what I expected, I read it from cover to cover.  Fellas, you could do a lot worse than getting tips on picking up chicks from a lesbian.  Ladies, read the list of things not to do the day after a hot date (show up with "a few things.") It will be a long time before society at large is ready to accept gay people.  Regardless of your politics, you have to respect the courage of those who live their lives in the open and even offer insight and benefit of wisdom to others.
