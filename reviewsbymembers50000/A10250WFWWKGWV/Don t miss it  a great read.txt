 Regarding books about NASA, I confess that if the guy who scrapes seagull poop off the gantries at Kennedy releases a book tomorrow, I will camp out to buy it.  I like books about the space program and this is one of the very best.  One of the jacket blurbs recalls the idea of sending a poet into space implying that Mullane has successfully captured the beauty of viewing the Earth from space.  This might be a bit much; the poet gig is still open.  But Mullane has rendered a very accessible account of life in the space program during its brightest and darkest days. Some reviews make the author sound like a crass and vulgar man but I think he is just frank and forthright.  He jokes regularly about being from the planet AD (arrested development) but pre-PC is a more accurate diagnosis.  Feminists might be offended that he does not genuflect at the altar of Sally Ride but rather holds Judy Resnik in higher regard.
