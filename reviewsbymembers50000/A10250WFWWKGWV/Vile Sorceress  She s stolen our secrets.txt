 If you characterize the current state of gender relations in the Western World as a gender war then "Self-Made Man" must be treated as the contents of a captured spy's briefcase.  If you are not that paranoid, it's still pretty good.  A shortcoming is that she limits her adventures in ways that show more about class distinctions than gender.  Vincent's choices throughout the book show she is disdainful of the workaday world and the things ordinary people do to have fun and earn a living.  Some of her experiments could have been done without the masquerade but they would have been called "slumming."  She concludes, and I agree with her, that gender is a different phenomenon from sex.  But she also claims that people are taught their gender in early childhood and this I don't agree with.  (She seems to have missed the research that shows little girls playing dolls with "daddy and mommy" toy trucks and little boys using dolls as tools and jet planes.)  She also shows convincingly that people continue to accept original gender identification even if the outward cues are taken away.  I suspect some of Vincent's test subjects saw through her gender disguise immediately and simply treated her as a man because the circumstances made it irrelevant.  It is worth considering what impact this work will have among feminists.  It seems reasonable to expect a string of copycats so be on the lookout for the fellow who asks for extra napkins with the order of wings and forgets to look at the waitress's bottom.  I think we can also expect another round of women telling us it's okay to cry when we all know it's not.  "Self-Made Man" is a fun read and carries a few tidbits of useful wisdom.  Vincent states right up front that this is not a scientific experiment so cut her some slack if she cuts a few corners.  She seems like a basically decent person who did something interesting that took real cajones.
