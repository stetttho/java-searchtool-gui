 I set out looking for a light read and a good laugh.  By the end I was quite sad.    I confess that I enjoy liberal baiting immensely.  I don't think the current administration is substantially different from any that we have had in the past 50 years.  To see people wailing in the streets as though Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot and Mobuto had marched into Washington arm in arm is comical when voter turnouts and other forms of legitimate political participation are so low.  I was hoping to hear stories of Liberals demonstrating their profound misconceptions of how the grown-up world works.  But these are stories of hatred and paranoia; scary stories.  Even if you ignore the celebrity inanities; even if you ignore the yammering of average jane and joe liberal citizen you are still faced with university professors, radio commentators and elected officials, people with an acknowledged responsibility to act in the public interest, who are seething with hatred for...everything apparently.  I honestly think we are on the brink of another Civil War.
