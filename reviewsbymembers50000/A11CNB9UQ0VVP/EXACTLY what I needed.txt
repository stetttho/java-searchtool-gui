 Wow!  I'm amazed at this book -- THANK YOU David Allen! Ireceived this book Saturday, and plowed right through it. Monday andTuesday at work, I picked up a bunch of manila folders, and startedmaking lists and following the instructions and workflowdiagram. Lemme tell you -- if you find you're overwhelmed at work -either through having too much, or being filled with uncertainty mostof the time, or finding your shoulders up in the air out of stress, ora stress-induced backache, get this book. The funny thing is: Mostof this is stuff you already know in some way or another.  But the wayhe puts it all together, it is so clear and simple to do, and theresults are AMAZING! People at work already (in just four days) aresurprised at how much calmer I am now, and I seem in control.  A fewco-workers are also ordering this book. One of the gems of the book,lies in the little things.  For example: Do you have an inbox?  Ididn't have an inbox at work - and neither do any of my co-workers orbosses.  Such a simple thing.  Or at home - do you leave your maileverywhere?  Just get a box and mark it "In", and take careof issues (phone calls, papers, etc) AS THEY ARRIVE. It's worth theprice.  My copy is already dog-earred all over the place.  My bosswants to borrow it when I'm done, and a friend of mine, who wasskeptical about this, sees how I'm pulling things together, and wantsto borrow it to utilize in organizing his college career...
