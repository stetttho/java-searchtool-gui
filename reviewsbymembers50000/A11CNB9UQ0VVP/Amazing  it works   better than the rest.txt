 Pimsleur is a Godsend for me!  I spent almost two years trying to learn Russian with varying success and failure using many other books, tapes, methods.  But Pimsleur is the ONLY one that really, truly works!  It really teaches grammar without teaching grammar - it really gets you talking and  understanding.  The price seems stiff at first, but it's really worth it!   Pay a few more dollars - save up if you have to - and get Pimsleur courses  when you want to learn a language!
