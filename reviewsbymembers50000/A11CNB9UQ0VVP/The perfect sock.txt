 These are the perfect men's socks.  In our house, there are many people living here.  Some men, some women, some kids, all family.  Over the past three years, everybody has converted to the Hanes with the grey heel.  Women and men alike.  It is the ultimate, no-nonsense, comfortable sock.  Perhaps some like tube socks.  Perhaps some like low-cut socks, but for all purpose, no-nonsense don't-have-to-think-about-sock, it's the Hanes with the gray heel.  You can buy me them for Christmas or birthday anytime!  Keep my feet dry and comfortable.  They wash cleanly most of the time.  They last for a couple of  years.  Perfect!
