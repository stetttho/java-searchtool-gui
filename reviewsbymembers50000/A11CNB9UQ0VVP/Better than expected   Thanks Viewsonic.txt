 I received this unit last night.  Ran a cable line up to my bedroom, and connected the monitor and stereo to the unit.   Adjusted the cable settings to fit our local cable setup, and - whammo - just like that, the most amazing thing I've seen: TV reception on my computer monitor! The Viewsonic VB50HRTV EXCEEDED my expectations.  I have a nice 17" Samsung .20mm dot pitch CRT monitor, which I love, and to see crisp TV reception on it is a wonderful thing. Just for the heck of it, I hooked up a little 9" color SVGA "banker" monitor, just to see if it would work, and it does!  So, in theory, with a VGA Y cable, one could hang a monitor on the wall over the bed, and another on your desk, and be able to switch between TV and computer... or even set it up with a switch box so that you could use two monitors as either TVs or computer monitors. You will want to play around with the color settings, as every monitor is different. The audio and video are perfectly synchronized, unlike a lot of units that are dependent upon the computer for them to function.   If you're looking for a TV tuner box which lets you see the TV in a little window while you work on the computer, this unit will not do that for you.  This is full-screen mode only: But it's Hi-resolution -- the crispness and clarity that you get with this is truly a treat.  You are turning your monitor into a REAL TV set.  It is worth every penny, and I'm glad to have found it.
