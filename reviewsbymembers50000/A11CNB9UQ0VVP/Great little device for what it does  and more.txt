 I'm a techie.  I know computers backwards and forwards, inside and out.  But sometimes I want to just type up a quick e-mail, or write myself a note and print it out.  Computers take too long to boot up, and are too big, or the batteries are a measly 3-4 hours long. This little VTech Companion fit the bill just fine! Weighing in at about 2 lbs, I now can read/write my e-mail while sitting in the bathroom, or in the library.  If I wake up in the middle of the night and want to write something and print it out in a moment of inspiration, I can do that.  Just type up an e-mail to myself, and before sending it, print it out.  [this device prints to ANY parallel-port printer, except for the "Windows-Only" printers.  If your printer can print text, this will work with it]. I'm addicted: I get home from work, and before signing on to my ISP, I plug this baby into the phone line, type in my password, hit "Connect", and it zaps my e-mail to me.  The screen is very clear and easy to read. The ISP/e-mail contract is inexpensive too -- less than $10/month.  I also love the fact that you can check your mail anywhere there is a standard phone line. The batteries!  How can I forget!  One of the loveliest features of the VTech Postbox Companion is that it takes just 3 C batteries, which should last about 6 months.  This, to me, is a wonderous thing.   This little device also brought the mystery back into online for me.  I am from the BBS days, dialing up mysterious computers from far away.  They hardly exist anymore, but this VTech brings the mystery of things back for me.   This device *doesn't* do everything, and it isn't supposed to.  I use it for e-mail, and as a portable word processor.  It won't replace your ISP, but it does give you an amazing portability, with a keyboard that is comfortable. Thumbs up to VTech!
