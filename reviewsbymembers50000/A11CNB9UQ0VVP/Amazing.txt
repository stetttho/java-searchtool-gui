 I'm very pleased with the Quicklink Pen.  My mother, who is not a "gadget" person, was even more amazed with it. We've done several scanners.  We have a 4 inch hand scanner, a flatbed, even one that takes 81/2x11 sheets and scans them. They all work great for what they do, but the biggest pain is scanning in books ,especially when all you want is a couple of paragraphs. Enter the Quickpen.   It takes a few tries to get the right angle for scanning, but that's like anything - there's a small learning curve. The best is being able to lay down in my hammock with a book in hand, and the scanner in the other.  When I find a quote that I like, I scoop it up with the pen. Something I greatly look forward to is the memory expansion pak.  I ordered it today, and have been longing for years for the ability to translate text on the fly, as I'm interested in other languages. I'll tell you how it goes!
