 The thumboard - I just received it today.  You won't be able to type as fast as a fast touch typist, but you can do quite well enough. The keys are responsive and quick - no lag time at all. The portability is the biggest plus for me, as I walk everywhere, and am always trying to write things on my Visor using Graffitti.. I've gotten good at it, but it's still too slow. But with the Thumboard, I can walk and type with my thumbs, plus just pop it off, and stick it in my pocket when I'm not using it. That's the main thing I like about this: mobility.  It also has an excellent balance to it.
