 Pocket Money is an amazing product.   The program works very cleanly.  Within 1 hr of playing around with it, I actually had, for the first time in one place, a listing of what my net worth was!  To me, that's an amazing feat.  I've got my 401k totals there, stock holdings, checking accts, savings accts, home equity, credit cards, the amount of change sitting in my drawer, and even the amount of money sitting in my pocket! It took only a few minutes, and the results are truly a peace of mind, because, with every transaction, whether ATM, or in a store, or wherever, I can open up the program, and quickly add the amount of the purchase or deposit or transfer, give it a category if I want, and who it went to, and that's it.  Done.  I can forget about it until my next transaction takes place. Now I don't have to wonder if I'll have enough for this item or that.  Just by putting in bills that I know are coming in at the beginning of the month, I can see how much I *really* have, rather than the tempting figure that sometimes prints out on an ATM receipt.   Thanks makers of Pocket Money!
