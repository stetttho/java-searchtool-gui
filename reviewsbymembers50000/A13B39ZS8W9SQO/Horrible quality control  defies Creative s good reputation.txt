 A bit pricey, but unfortunately, you need one of these things to unlock the FM radio feature.  The big issues: After a couple months of flawless performance, I started to get the noise, random cutoff and extremely touchy controls noted in other reviews here.  After one not-too-tremendous drop, the remote stopped working completely.  Still writing to Creative about beginning the RMA process. As far as when it's working, like I said, it's necessary for radio features.  On my Muvo2, it's particularly crucial, since the poorly-designed case doesn't allow access to any of the controls (let alone the LCD screen), so if you want to protect the player, you'll either have this or be pulling apart the case's velcro over and over.  Unfortunately, the remote doesn't let you change folders, so you'll be pulling the player out from time to time regardless. The unit is a bit big and awkward, especially with the way it plugs into a Muvo.  The 'mode' button is easy to hit accidentally.  Of course, I'd live with the drawbacks to get the extra features and accessibility -- if my unit worked.  In that case, I'd probably give it three stars.
