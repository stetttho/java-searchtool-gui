 Ron Chernow's Alexander Hamilton is a near-mythical figure. He has his human flaws - profound flaws, in fact, which do great damage - but these are easily outmatched by his phenomenal talents, contributions, and (more often than not, at least) vision. He was brash, made enemies easily, and gave in to temptation. Even so, Chernow puts forth a convincing argument that Hamilton was the founding father who did most to promote good government, and saw most clearly the form of the future United States. Through sheer genius and force of argument, he helped win approval of the Constitution, established America's capitalist system, and gave the United States - from scratch - the institutions of a modern nation-state, all less popular measures at the time than can be imagined now. At every step of the way, he faced down utopian revolutionary fervor and anti-commercial prejudice in a still-agrarian America.        His enemies (virtually every founding father outside Washington) clearly have points about the sometimes wildly overzealous Hamilton's ideas, but Chernow paints them rather unfavorably, to say the least. Adams is a vain, insipid coward who complains about Hamilton's power without ever attempting to assert control over his own government. Jefferson is a dastardly plotting hypocrite, whose actions occasionally verge on treason (e.g. when he opens back channels with the French to try to undermine American negotiations). Aaron Burr, Hamilton's mortal enemy, defines lack of principles. Hamilton is called an aristocrat by southern slave-driving plantation masters.        While one can't imagine anybody would have gone through all of Hamilton's lifetime writing output - he is described as the 'human word machine' - the depth of Chernow's research is fascinating. He even attempts to divine what revelations are hidden in portraits done of Hamilton throughout his life. There isn't a paragraph of filler in this 730-page tome. If there is a fault, it's the full stop at Hamilton's death, aside from mini-bios of his wife and Burr; a final review of his legacy and how his institutions and ideas survived the centuries would have been nice.        Definitely recommended reading for anybody looking to be inspired by how much one man, armed only with boundless energy and an eagerness for overpowering intellectual argument, can accomplish.
