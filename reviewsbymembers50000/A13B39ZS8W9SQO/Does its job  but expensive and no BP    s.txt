 If you use larger lenses, you'll probably want this just to balance the camera properly.  And since larger lenses need more power to focus, and Image Stabilization drains the batteries more quickly, two batteries can come in handy.  Most likely you'll have power for at least a full day of heavy shooting.  Unfortunately, though the EOS-10D itself can take BP-512 batteries, this grip cannot - BP-511/511as or similarly-shaped batteries only.  It can use different batteries in combination, even with different power ratings; it will first use the higher-charged battery, then drain them both equally.  I use a Power 2000 1500mAh/7.4v together with my old BP-511 1100mAh/7.4v.  It comes with a little slot in the side of the shaft that can hold the camera's battery cover (which must be removed) or an extra CF card.  Handy.  And you get extra control buttons on the grip for taking pictures in a vertical orientation, and a switch to disable them.  The price is excessive, though.  If it were priced similarly to the Rebel's grip, I'd give this five stars easily.  At US$200, it's a much tougher call - it should still go on your wish lists, but at a much lower priority, depending on your purposes and equipment.
