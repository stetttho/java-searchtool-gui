 Although the book was filled with the obscene number of errors other reviewers mention (I wondered often whether I was mismatching book and software versions somehow), there are no complete show-stoppers.  There are several major inconveniences, particularly as regards importing files into the site, which the book says can be done much more simply than my copy of the software allowed.  I managed to complete the instructions for every lesson, and it effectively showed, step-by-step, how to use most of the major features of GoLive. It describes the basics of forms, CSS, JavaScript, etc., making it a fine 'for dummies' intro, though one might wish it went into considerably more depth on just about every topic, or at least had a sequel. A serviceable instruction book once you learn to work around the more major errors, but not up to the par of the other Adobe books.  You may want to look elsewhere.
