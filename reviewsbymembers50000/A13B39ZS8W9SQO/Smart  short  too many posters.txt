 This book showcases Bill Maher's politically incorrectness in all areas, from the much-discussed (our energy dependence and its connections with terrorism) to the intriguingly under-discussed (diamonds, and the same).  Maher writes very short essays (in big print) on a wide variety of terrorism-related topics, calling for real lifestyle changes and honesty in an attempt to shake us out of our everything's-changed-but-how-I-live slumber, interspersing them with WWII-style posters mocking our politicians and our misconceptions.  At least one of them is guaranteed to offend - notably the one about the silliness of codified religions.  Though the essays are generally smart, funny and incisive, they're too short, scattershot, and the posters get considerably less inspired as the book goes on.  There's simply not enough written material: it can be read easily in an evening.  One gets the feeling that if Maher had the drive, he could be a modern-day Voltaire.  Instead the essays, pungent and entertaining as they are, just scratch the surface of his topics and are at best loosely held together by the theme of sacrifice in a new world - something which he seems to go a bit overboard with, even if you agree with him on oil and diamonds.  Hopefully, he'll find the inspiration someday to settle down and write a real "serious" 300-pager.  Minus the pictures.
