 PBS took an interesting and useful approach with this documentary, but ultimately it's limited by the simple fact that you can't squeeze the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict into two DVDs.  Many of the major players are interviewed on the Israeli side.  Fewer major Arab figures are there to present their views, partly due to death/assassination, and you're left to speculate as to other reasons.  Thus smaller figures usually speak for the Arabs, from generals to foot soldiers, and footage from old interviews fills in some of the gaps.  There are no reenactments, and little modern-day footage aside from the interviewees.  There is a minimum of judgment or criticism, which may leave viewers wishing for a bit more analysis.  Still, it's a generally pleasing format which uncovers many interesting factlets.  Unfortunately, you don't need to dig very far to find problems, as they begin at the wildly optmistic title: '50 Years War' seems more tragicomic with each passing year, and limits the film terribly in that it starts just after World War II, and ends with a sudden stop fifty years later with peace talks on the horizon and an air of 'happily ever after'.  One gets no backgrounder on the controversies over Jews initially moving to the area, WWI power plays, or the conflict between 1918 and 1945, let alone the collapse of Camp David talks and Intifada II.  What is there is heavily truncated to fit into five hours of film, while a really comprehensive treatment would probably require a full shelf of DVDs.  But anybody trying to gain a thorough understanding of the conflict should review information from as many sources with as many viewpoints as possible, and PBS takes a decent stab at a summary.  It's just a shame about the title.
