 A liberal, I'm no fan of Hilary Clinton.  What bothers me most about this book is not its truth or falsity, but what the author thinks is worth my time.  The so-called "character issue" -- around since at least Clinton's first Presidential primary -- has become simply an excuse for smear.  Do I care whether Hilary suffers from ambition or whether she's hypocritical about her husband's personal life?  Not really.  After all, these attacks have so far been little more than partisan turf war.  You can tell such is the case when only Conservatives get to wear white hats and Liberals are handed only black ones.  After all, several Conservatives have been caught with their pants down and their tongues hanging out, and we hear nothing from the conservative camp about "character."  In short, there's very little of substance in this book.  Far better to explain what's wrong with Hilary Clinton's political views and her policies.  How much has she accomplished, given the limitations of the political climate?  Instead, Klein gives us third-rate titillation (ooh, LESBIANS!!!).  Unless you have a taste for schlock, give this a miss.
