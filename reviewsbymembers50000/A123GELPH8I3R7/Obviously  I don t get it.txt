 I'm a classical-music freak, so the idea of a dotty composer and his equally-dotty biographer appealed to me right away.  However, to me the book is a rehash of Nabokov, at a level you'd find in a creative-writing seminar from a well-read, though not particularly gifted student.  There's nothing obviously wrong with it, but nothing obviously right, either.  In fact, I found it pretentious, rather than stimulating.  The idea of a hero who tries to construct his life as he would create a piece of art Nabokov did a lot better, possibly because Nabokov understands the tragedy of the situation and finds something worthy in his ridiculous heroes.  As I read Miller, I found myself asking, "Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?"  Miller's humor -- and, by the way, he tends to explain his better jokes, as if he doesn't trust the reader to get them -- struck me as small-minded, mean-spirited, and, worst of all, precious. So I'm the strident note in the chorus of general praise.  My reaction is probably idiosyncratic, but for other oddballs, this might be a warning.
