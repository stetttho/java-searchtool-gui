 I've been watching Roger Ebert on TV for years and occasionally read his column.  I always thought he had his critical head screwed on straight (when it came to American movies in particular -- he's not seduced by the Literary or someone's notion of High Culture) even when I disagreed about this or that movie.  However, I never thought of him as anything other than capable, before I read his two books on The Great Movies.  Ebert writes beautifully and, for me, re-awakens my experience of the movies he talks about.  He clearly knows a lot about film vocabulary (far more than I do) and has read widely beyond his chosen field.  These essays, one after another, have knocked me over.  In the cases of movies I haven't seen, I now have GOT to see them.  I'm putting these next to my Bazins, Agee, and Kaels.
