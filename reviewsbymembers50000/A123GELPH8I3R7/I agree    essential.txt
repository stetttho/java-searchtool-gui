 Ellington's large works have usually been slammed by classical music critics, who apparently expected him to produce Beethovenian sonata-allegros.  Furthermore, they had very little idea of the popular models Ellington took off from.  "Black, Brown, and Beige" in particular suffered from this kind of ignorant dismissal.  Ellington's dearest ambition was to be taken seriously as a composer, in the sense that Bartok and Stravinsky were, rather than as a "mere" bandleader and songwriter, and these criticisms made him insecure and extremely defensive.  After his critical mauling, Ellington withdrew "Black, Brown, and Beige" for a time and jettisoned at least two movements.  When BB&B returned, it had been substantially rethought.  Fortunately, all the original had been recorded (although not all of it at the Carnegie Hall concert), and that's what this CD gives us here.  This is a highpoint of Ellington, which means a highpoint of American music (popular or classical), and for that reason alone, this CD justifies its existence.  In addition, you get the Ellington band of the Forties in performances of classics like "Ko-ko," "Rockin' in Rhythm," the portraits of Bert Williams, Florence Mills, and Bojangles, "Cotton Tail," "Black and Tan Fantasy," "Boy Meets Horn," and many more Ellington standards, as well as "Rose of the Rio Grande," to remind you that the band wasn't in it just for the art.  The sound isn't the best, even for recordings of the period, but that consideration is absolutely irrelevant for people who actually listen to music, rather than to engineering.
