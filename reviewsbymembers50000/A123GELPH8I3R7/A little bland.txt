 Castelnuovo-Tedesco, best-known probably for his 1939 guitar concerto, wrote music that I don't believe can be called strongly memorable.  It's expertly written, at times even beautiful, but it seems to disappear as soon as it's over.  Furthermore, he never seemed to find himself, or at least to establish a strong artistic personality.  At his best, he resorts to a neoclassic idiom.  Most of the time, the music, despite its occasional prettiness, doesn't sound like much of anything.   The works here the composer wrote near or at the top of his game.  Naomi and Ruth, a little cantata, tells the familiar story, with the soprano soloist taking the part of Naomi and the chorus taking over the narration and the words of Ruth.  It's an almost archetypal example of the composer's unevenness, in that the music for the chorus is much stronger than that for the soprano.  The Sacred Service has its moments, but large stretches of it simply go by.  My favorite parts of the CD were the excerpts from the organ preludes, Prayers My Grandfather Wrote, and especially from the Memorial Service for the Departed.  Here, whatever engagement the composer had with his inspiration manages to cross over to the listener. The performances are mostly top-drawer, with Neville Marriner leading an outstanding Naomi and Ruth.  The choir and orchestra knock you out with their precision and tone.  By comparison, Ronald Corp's Sacred Service sounds muddy, and the baritone soloist, Ted Christopher, suffers from what sounds like occasional vocal tiredness.  Organist Barbara Harbach gives an intense account of the Prayers, and canto Simon Spiro (though of modest voice) nevertheless sings beautifully and with wonderful communication in the Memorial Service.  Indeed, the composer gets such strong performances, it may be difficult to separate one's pleasure in the singers and players from the pleasure in the work.
