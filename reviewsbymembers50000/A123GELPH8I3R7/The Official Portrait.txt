 Ellington's "Black, Brown, & Beige" ranks as probably his most ambitious work and the one in which he made his heaviest emotional investment.  When critics mauled its premiere in the early Forties, Ellington more or less withdrew it.  Fifteen years later, he brought it back, substantially reworked, and with at least two of the original movements gone.  We get here a kind of Official Portrait of, in my opinion, a more interesting original, but it's still an extraordinarily beautiful work.  Also, the Ellington band plays the bejeezus out of it.  Ellington wanted Mahalia Jackson for the recording.  She had doubts, but Ellington soothed her out of them.  Good thing, too.  Her "Come Sunday" (written especially for her) ranks as one of her most extraordinary, uplifting performances, and that's saying something.  I also love the solos from John Sanders on valve trombone and especially Ray Nance on violin.  Grappelli, eat your heart out!
