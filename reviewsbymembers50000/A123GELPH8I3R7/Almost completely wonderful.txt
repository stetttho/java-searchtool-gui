 Its very considerable advantage lies in its completeness.  Poulenc was one of the very greatest songwriters of any era.  If you have no Poulenc songs in your collection, start here.  The recommendation of Kruysen is a fine one, but only after you have heard this as a basis of comparison.  Of Ameling, Senechal, Souzay, Gedda, and Parker, the only disappointment is Parker, who - I'll just say it - sings with his usual bleat.  Souzay is a shade past it in vocal quality, but he still understands these songs as well as anybody, with great declamation (and that, after all, is what most of French singing is about).  The dryness of the voice is nowhere close to disastrous, as it might have been in Italian opera.  Indeed, it lends an air of life lived, without excuses.  Gedda is okay.  The standouts are Souzay, Ameling, and Senechal.  Baldwin accompanies superbly.
