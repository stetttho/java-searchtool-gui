 A landmark in Vaughan Williams criticism.  The book handles questions both of intellectual milieu (Frogley's essay on English musical identity relates it to a wider movement) and of Vaughan Williams's musical art.  The essay  on VW's use of rhythm is outstanding, thoroughly refuting the picture of  him as some musical bumpkin, but essays of this type require some  familiarity with the nuts and bolts of music as well as the ability to read  it.  The book well rewards the effort it requires.  This has become a  favorite book, one that I reread.
