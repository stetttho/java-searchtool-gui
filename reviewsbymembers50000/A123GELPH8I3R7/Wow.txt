 Let's face it:  most cookbooks have maybe two or three recipes you incorporate into your repertoire.  I must admit the Culinary Institute of America imprimatur put me off (I'm a *cook*, not a chef, and I associate the CIA with the Arugula Heresy and the California Cuisine Abomination).  This, along with Beard on Bread, the original troika of Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Marcella Hazan, and various Louisiana and Chinese cookbooks has definitely got a permanent place on my shelves.  I've tried 10 recipes so far from the various categories (Broths, Hearty Soups, Cream Soups, Pureed Soups, Bisques & Chowders, Cold Soups) and not only haven't found a dud, but have been brought to food overjoy.  I admit that I've chosen with an eye to avoiding stuff I don't like (like split pea, which traumatized me as a child, or puree of carrot & orange, which simply sounds vile to me, rather than intriguing -- the California Cuisine Abomination again). With a Cuisinart or similar appliance, none of these things are very hard, especially if you keep stocks around.  If you don't, buy a package of stock at your grocery store, which I do when I don't have the time to roast and simmer.  I've seen more specialized books (there's one very good one devoted to chowders, whose name escapes me right now), but this is the best general-soup book I've used.
