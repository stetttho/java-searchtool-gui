 I have to admit, I don't read French, and that often makes a difference.  Adriana Hunter translated.  I don't know if what bothers me is Hunter's or Nothomb's fault.  I thought the book intelligent and interesting in its report on cultural clash (the narrator keeps getting shoved to a lower and lower corporate rung, because she's compassionate in Western terms).  But its prose comes off a bit flat.  If you like the prose, you might call it "elegant," in a very French way.  But there's no "after-ring."  For me, a great -- even very good novel -- shows a lot more than it says.  English literature has a tradition of "richness" -- we expect rounded characters.  Even mysterious characters -- people we don't understand fully or at all -- echo in our minds.  We ask questions of them.  Nothomb doesn't allow us to ask questions.  The Japanese are a mystery, the cultural clash is ironic.  It's as if she wrote out an essay outline and then found incidents that illustrated the thesis.  But there's almost nothing else beyond that thesis.  I will say there's a surprising irony concerning the head of the firm, but it's too little, too late.  I read this book and enjoyed it, but I won't be re-reading it.
