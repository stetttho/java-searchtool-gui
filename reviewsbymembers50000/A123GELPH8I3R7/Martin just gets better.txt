 Martin's career fascinates me because I see him enter a new field at a certain level and then improve on subsequent outings.  He's always been good enough from the get-go to earn the indulgence of fans and financers, which of course buys him time.  People will take a chance on Steve Martin.  Pure Drivel, his collection of short, humorous essays, bettered his first effort, Cruel Shoes (much of which reworked his standup routines).  Roxanne, his sharp adaptation of Cyrano, seemed to come from nowhere, if we consider his previous screenplays -- The Jerk, The Man with Two Brains, and Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid.  L. A. Story (one of my favorite films) revealed a screenwriting talent of the highest caliber.  Likewise, after Shopgirl, a rather self-conscious, too-careful effort, Martin comes up with The Pleasure of My Company. Martin has always used words sparely and elegantly.  Here, however, he manages to give the impression of having loosened up a bit, of taking artistic risks with his characters.  The characters of Shopgirl were a little too easy and too familiar to readers of New Yorker fiction.  One always sensed Martin's controlling hand in their actions, and the best parts of the book seemed to be the by-the-way observations of Southern California culture.  In Pleasure, one actually cares what happens to the hero -- a self-absorbed neurotic so inside his own head that he has, essentially, withdrawn to the rooms of his small apartment.  Among the many ironies, he enters (twice!) an essay contest on why he is the Most Typical American.  As in L. A. Story, Martin's somewhat surreal view of life (in this case, explored through a character suffering from world-class obsessive-compulsive disorder) turns out to be, not really nightmarish, but a sense of wonder toward the ordinary world.
