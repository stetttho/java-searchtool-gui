 OK, I admit to a slight prejudice (I'm the translator's proud brother), but don't take my word for it.  The NY Times put it on their Best of '98 list. I don't know any Russian beyond a few guidebook phrases and isolated  words that pop up in Russian songs and James Bond novels.  All I ask of a  translation is that it give me the sense that I'm reading great literature.   I usually don't know enough - as in this case - to comment on accuracy or  to nit-pick connotations.  What my "reader's voice" gives me is  the sound of a masterpiece, different from the sound of the translator's  own prose (read the wonderful introductory memories of Berberova).   The  three stories collected here weren't meant as a trilogy and are separated  by years and, in the case of the last, by several decades.  The first two  reminded me of Tolstoy's "Death of Ivan Illych," with their  satiric and grotesque edge on death and illness.  The last seemed to me  more modern, even somewhat like Kafka, in its phantasmagoria.  I must admit  to liking the third story -- about an immigrant in New York City - best.   Berberova is good and even funny on the disorientation of the newcomer, but  also romantic  (and Romantic) about the city's attraction and mystery.    The book is filled with passages of virtuoso storytelling - all of which  seem to point to a big nature that could easily create a novel.  In the  first, a description of a burial stands out.  In the second, a sick woman  is taken out of a rooming house run by almost fairy-tale witches to a  hospital.  In the third, the immigrant is given a pair of (magic?)  binoculars by someone who reminds me strongly of a wizard in a cave and is  shown a series of powerful, disturbing images - realistic and fantastic at  the same time.  I have to bring up classic masters to remind myself of  anything this good.  Berberova's a thrilling find.
