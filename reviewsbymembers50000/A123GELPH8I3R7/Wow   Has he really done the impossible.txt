 History shows us that "standard" translations are really translations for the time.  As good as Pope's translation of the Iliad is - and it's good enough to stand on its own as an English poem - it definitely  smacks of its time, particularly in how it moves and in its concern for  rhetorical balance.  Fagles has at least given me the Iliad of my own time.   I read it the first time with part of me saying, "This is *so* good,  can it last?"  I have no idea.  What impresses me so much is that it  is undoubtedly wonderful poetry - poetry that makes you marvel at word  choice and rhetorical construction - and yet it moves with the speed of an  adventure novel.  In other words, it exemplifies (as no other translation  has for me) what scholars have been telling us about Homer for centuries.   I don't understand classical Greek.  I can't read Homer in the original,  but I believe Fagles has given me something very, very close indeed.
