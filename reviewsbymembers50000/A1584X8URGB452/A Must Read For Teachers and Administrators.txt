 I happened upon this fine autobiography one day while browsing through the library at West Middle School where I am a 7th grade teacher. I don't even remember what drew me to this book, but some form of "magic" must  have been involved, because its enchantment is still on me. I hold this  book in such high regard that I have read it to my classes over the years.  I don't recall one student ever asking me to stop reading it. The stories  of this fine man's life are intriguing and in many ways unbelieveable!  "Thread" chronicles Jesse Stewart's career as a  teacher/principal/superintendent of schools in rural Kentucky. He not only  fought for the rights of his fellow teachers, but also the rights of his  students. He believed that an education would set any man or woman free,  especially those he taught inKentucky's hills and hollows. This book should  be read by every teacher. It should be required reading for every principal  and school superintendent in this fine country of ours. Do yourself a favor  and buy this book.
