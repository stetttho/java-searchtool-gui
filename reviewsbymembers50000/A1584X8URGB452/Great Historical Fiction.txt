 One day I went into my school's library looking for a book.  I looked on the shelves and could not find one, so I looked at the books that were selected for the Newbery Awards.  There I found " Mr Lincoln's  Drummer".  It is such a good book.  Not only was it good, it was  historical.  This book is based on a true story, so it has such characters  as, Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, and many more.  I enjoyed this book and  I recommend it to all middle school students.                                  --J.S.
