 I had the honor of meeting Redd at a Merle concert and was privileged to give him a vintage '56 Fender pick.  I became an instant fan of Redd's after hearing him play with the country legend.  Telewacker is an  incredible guitar album, which includes some pretty nice vocals by the  guitarist. He not only plays traditional country, but also dabbles in the  blues. When you buy the CD, get a load of Redd's hands. How on earth does  he get that beautiful, delicate, refined sound out of those sausage-sized  fingers?
