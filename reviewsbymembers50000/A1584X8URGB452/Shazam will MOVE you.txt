 I first heard this album back in the late-60s/early 70s--I can't remember clearly that far back. I was in a used record store in Hollywood, browsing through the stacks and stacks of vinyl, when I heard the most incredible  rock music I'd ever heard up to that point. I could not ignore it, as it  became more than just background music for shoppers like myself. I was so  taken in by the music that I went to the store owner and asked him what it  was. He showed me the album and I bought it immediately. You know how you  played Sgt Pepper over and over when you first got it? Shazam got played  more than any of my other albums. I couldn't get enough of it.  Somewhere  along the line, the album disappeared. When CDs became the rage, I searched  all over for Shazam, and finally found it as an import (Japanese).  Actually, it was part of a Move "twofer". The music is still as  fresh as it was nearly 30 years ago. (Read the review that is a couple  down...good background). My personal favorite is "Cherry Blossom  Clinic (Revisited)", but they are all excellent. This is truly one of  those "perfect" albums. You can't go wrong with this one. Heck,  I'm tempted to buy this reissue just to hear the other songs that aren't  part of the original Shazam!
