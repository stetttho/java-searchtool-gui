 I recently saw Tom Rush perform, and he commented that one of the best things about this project is that he was able to go through all his past recordings and choose those songs that should appear on "No  Regrets". My only wish is that he'd chosen one more song from his  "Take a Walk with Me" album. That being Bo Diddley's "Who Do  You Love?", which is the song that made me a Tom Rush fan. The CD is  in chronological order, which gives you a taste of where he started, where  he is today, and all phases in between. Perhaps, Elektra will dust off some  of their old masters and reissue Tom's complete catalog, which is simply  the artist's best work.
