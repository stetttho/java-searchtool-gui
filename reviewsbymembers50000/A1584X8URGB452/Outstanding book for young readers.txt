 This is a book that I happened across one day while browsing through a pile of discarded books. The saying, "one man's trash is another man's treasure" holds true for this fine piece of children's literature. I  used this book when I worked with a reluctant reader. It worked like magic!  We had great fun reading and discussing this story of a homeless boy who is  "adopted" by the owner of a sheep ranch. Later, I adopted this  book as a class novel for my sixth grade language arts classes. What a  blast! The Loner has plenty of action and suspense. It lends itself to  wonderful discussions. It is chockful of moral questions. It's enlightening  and heartwarming. I strongly recommend this as a book for parents to read  along with their children. You will both benefit.
