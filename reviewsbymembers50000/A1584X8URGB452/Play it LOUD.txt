 Considering when this gig was recorded and the fact that Phil Keaggy was in his late teens at the time, this is one of the greatest  "live" recordings you'll ever hear. But to fully appreciate it,  you MUST PLAY IT LOUD!  If you don't, you will not enjoy it nearly as  much. The first time I slapped it into my CD player I was alone at home, so  I cranked it up! WOW!  It was like being at the concert hall. The next  time I played it, I turned it down to a more conservative level...it was a  different CD altogether. It sounded pretty lame, to be honest. If you can't  crank it up, don't buy it. Keaggy does do some pretty amazing stuff on his  Les Paul. The last track is a showcase for this ace. It is your typical  70's-style jam with each member getting his chance to strut his stuff. It  is obvious this trio knew each other well, as they play off one another  over the course of nearly 30 minutes on just this one song. I'm sure The  Kinks (the band Glass Harp opened for) had a hard time besting the opening  act. Make sure you check out Keaggy's "Blue" CD.
