 Having been a long time fan of Poco and Richie Furay's, I was thrilled to see that he had finally released a new solo album. Unlike many old-time rock-and-rollers, time has not been unkind to Furay's voice. God has  blessed him with the ability to still hit those trade mark high notes, and  the patented harmony blends are there just like in the 70's. The message of  which he sings makes this disc all the better. I have had the privilege of  visiting Richie's church and also hearing him perform in a small venue. I  would love to hear him perform with a full band, doing material from In My  Father's House as well as a few Poco tunes. His last effort (actually, the  Poco reunion album, which was weak, considering Furay had only two lead  vocals. I mean, wasn't it HIS voice that helped define their music) was  just enough to whet my appetite for more.  If you like the Springfield/Poco  sound, this CD is for you. Not a bad cut on the disc .                              "Hallel", the opening song, blows you away with its tight,  high lonesome, harmony."Wake Up My Soul" will awaken memories of  Poco. It was a long wait, but well worth it!  O.K. Richie! It is time to  get back in the studio.
