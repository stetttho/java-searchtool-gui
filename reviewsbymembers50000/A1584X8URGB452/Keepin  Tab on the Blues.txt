 This CD is a perfect primer to Mr. Benoit's brand of  blues. "These Blues Are All Mine" displays his raw approach to guitar playing  which harkens back to the days of Albert King, when the most important part was  exposing your musical soul. To Tab, it's not important to hit every note  correctly, which makes his music so intriguing. If this CD has one  drawback, it is the inclusion of the Hammond B-3, which almost seems like a  safety net--something Benoit does not need. "These Blues..." also  comes across as quite tame to anyone who has seen this guy play live. I  would say it's like trying to compare a poster of a van Gogh with the  actual painting. It can be appreciated, but not fully understood. For  example, "Crosscut Saw" on the CD is under three minutes in  length, while "live" it goes more than twice that time. The lack  of his soloing just seems to take away from the overall product. And seeing  him grind out a solo on just four strings (he breaks a lot of 'em) without  missing a beat, is a thing to behold. I give this 5 stars, because for a  studio album, it possesses much of the qualities you find in one of his  shows, it just happens to be the Reader's Digest version thereof. Go see  him if he ever comes to your town, he won't disappoint and you'll always go  back for more!
