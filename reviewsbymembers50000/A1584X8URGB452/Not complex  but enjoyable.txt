 Before I read this book, I spent a good deal of time looking through the reviews--mainly the 3 stars and less, as I was interested in the downside of this novel. I'm glad I did, because I read it with a more critical eye  than if I'd chosen to read the serie's cheerleaders' reviews. I must admit,  I enjoyed this one as much as any of the others. If you read it for  escapism, as is the intention of most series, you don't really want a lot  of details bogging down the flow of the story. The authors accomplish this  feat. Their point, I'm sure, is to both entertain and inform. It is far  more accessible and understandable to the layman than is The Revelation. It  will also be an aid to those who actually sit down and read the biblical  version. The authors, though at times in the previous books tend to make  the main characters superhero-like, have done a good job with showing the  vulnerability of the big three in this one. Poor Chloe has been beaten up  pretty badly two books in a row! Doesn't matter how she looks, Buck loves  her just the same. The books are addictive, and I'm probably going to have  to run to Sam's Club and get the next one. I can't wait to decode Amanda's  correspondences with Nicolae. I had a funny feeling about her in the  previous book.
