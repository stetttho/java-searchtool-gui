 Nicolae is an enjoyable enough book, but his evil is not really personified to my satisfaction. Yeah, he does a lot of terrible things--destruction of Chicago, NYC, DC, San Fran, LA--but had Hitler the  technology, London would still be a shambles and I'd be writing this in  German! Marty Moon, from Jenkins' Gil Thorpe comic strip series, is just as  nasty!  I would still highly recommend this book, as it is an important  link in the series. When I finished it, I went right out and bought Soul  Harvest the next day. I hope the Land Rover people have had the good sense  to give the authors free vehicles. They can stand up to anything God can  throw at 'em!  "Land Rover! The Car of the Apocolypse! "
