 What a stunning concert this is!  The first disc, if you didn't know is Dylan, his acoustic guitar, and his harmonica. The songs he performs are not those from his "protest" days, but come from Bringin' It All  Back Home, Highway 61, Blonde on Blonde era. While he performs, you could  hear a pin drop, the audience is so deathly quiet. The termination of each  song is met with vigorous applause. Dylan is at his best! You get the  feeling that he is warming up the crowd for the electric set that is soon  to come, especially with his final song of the set Mr. Tambourine Man. He  seems to be spitting out the words of the chorus...amazing. The electric  set (disc two) is no less intense, especially considering the tension you  feel coming from the audience. It's almost as though they cleared out the  first group and brought in a bunch of rowdies. At the end of each song, the  applause seems just as strong as with the acoustic set, but the natives are  restless between the songs. I know it made me feel uncomfortable for  Dylan's sake. Of course, I believe this reaction only encouraged Mr. D. He  and the Hawks just crank out rock and roll.  Of the two discs, one is not  better than the other. They are classic in their own right. As I mentioned,  it's as though two separate gigs took place on two separate nights. I think  the first part of that last statement is true. This IS Bob Dylan at his  best, especially when you compare it with his and the Band's Before (or is  it After) the Flood. A 50-plus page booklet comes with the set, which makes  for great reading while enjoying the music. And for those of you who think  Dylan's voice spoils his lyrics, maybe you ought to stick with John Denver!
