 I cannot recall any novel that has moved me to such tears and silence. Perhaps it is the cumulative power of a great imaginative epic superbly told--the NEW/LONG/SHORT SUN Books. Perhaps it is because Wolfe continues to grow and challenge us as a writer, to take us places we've never been before. Perhaps real genius is beyond explanation. I'm sorry I can't say this any better. RETURN TO THE WHORL is unspeakably beautiful.
