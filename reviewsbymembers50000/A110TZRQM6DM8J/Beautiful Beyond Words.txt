 I've read the Long Sun Books six times, so far. They continue to amaze and surprise me, as if I've never read them before. For instance: They are extremely funny--something I've not heard much about. (For example: The scene where Patera Silk meets Patera Gulo. And nearly every time the night chough Oreb speaks.) These books are also deep and moving. Sometimes, great art is too big for words. Or, perhaps, we have to enlarge ourselves in order to absorb it. So I feel I am still reading this astonishing story; it is still working on me, changing me, and someday I may be able to express its achievement. Just now, I can't. And wait until you finish Wolfe's Short Sun books. I feel certain you'll understand then.
