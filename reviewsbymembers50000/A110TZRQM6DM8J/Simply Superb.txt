 Gene Wolfe is a treasure. A true original. Authors hold him in awe. Readers fumble trying to express the magic of his work. Astounding stories,  perfect craft, and a depth of emotional and philosophical courage that is  nearly impossible to describe. Among its many delights and shocks, ON  BLUE'S WATERS is perhaps the most moving portrait of a haunted man that I  have ever read. Under the guise of a typical science fiction extended  adventure series Wolfe is creating an entirely new thing: a meditation on  the journey of faith and the search for truth refracted through a dazzling  array of unforgettable characters. Why doesn't everyone know Gene Wolfe is  the best writer alive today?
