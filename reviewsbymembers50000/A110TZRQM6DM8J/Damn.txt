 Damn what a fine book. Amazing range and passion, wonderful writing. Weird and sad, surprising and wise. And very, very funny. Damn. Read one story and try to imagine the author. Read another and try again. Read a third and you will give up. Andy Duncan's got some serious stories to tell us. And we have such a good time listening to his remarkably convincing and varied voices we don't figure that out till later. A grand collection.
