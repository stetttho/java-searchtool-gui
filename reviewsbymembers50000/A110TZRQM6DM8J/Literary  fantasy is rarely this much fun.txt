 A rich and haunting tale--by turns horrifying,heartbreaking and hilarious, but always surprising. Ford is an eloquent tour guide of inner worlds; his vivid characters, thrilling journeys and impossible landscapes engage us  with the startling elusive logic of dreams. A worthy successor to the  excellent THE PHYSIOGNOMY, MEMORANDA stands on its own as a beautiful  meditation on memory--that most familiar and mysterious inner world. Bravo!
