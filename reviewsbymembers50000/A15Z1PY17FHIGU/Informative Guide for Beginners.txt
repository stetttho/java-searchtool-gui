 I'd always thought that fortune telling was interesting and wanted to learn more about it. I received much more than I expected when I bought "The Fortune Teller's Deck." I discovered that fortune telling with playing cards was interesting, accurate, and much simpler than using tarot cards. I'd tried to learn how to use tarot cards in the past but was always daunted by the task of memorizing so many card meanings. A deck of playing cards is much smaller than a tarot deck and, as a result, is easier to grasp. Jane Lyle offers her readers some of the most in-depth analysis' of the cards that I've seen (and by now, I've read several books on the subject). She includes keywords for each card so that they're easier to memorize and shares with her readers many different spreads. In my readings, the Star of Fifteen has been the most accurate. I definitely don't regret purchasing "The Fortune Teller's Deck." In fact, it's one of the best purchases I've ever made, and I recommend that anyone interested in fortune telling buy it.
