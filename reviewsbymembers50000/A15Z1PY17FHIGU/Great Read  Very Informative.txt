 Ted Andrew's book, the first I've read by the author, has a lot to offer a reader. It deals extensively with different types of spirit guides, including angels, and how to contact them. Andrews offers tips on how to facilitate contact, such as using incense and bathing in sea salts. I haven't attempted to contact my spirit guide yet, but I plan to soon. The only drawback to the book is that it doesn't explain meditation fully and left me somewhat confused. Andrews also discussed crystal ball gazing which was very interesting. I plan to research it further.
