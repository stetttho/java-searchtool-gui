 I've been trying to read tarot cards for a year, and I was always confused by the various meanings in the books.  Then, I read The 2 Hour Tarot Tutor.  It changed my readings - for the better!  It taught me to use my intuition (which I had always found to be very difficult before).  I even predicted that a friend would  move his things out of his girlfriend's house - the very night that he was moving!  If I had looked up the card meanings in a book, the reading would have been totally different and less accurate.  For anyone wanting to learn the tarot, this book is for you.
