 I finished the book last night.  I'd been coming back to it whenever I had free time because I was so engrossed in the story.  The writing is almost flawless.  My only complaint is that it seemed to wrap up pretty quickly, as if the author was tired of writing and decided to just sum up the last 40 or so years of her life. Given the outcome of the story, it makes sense, but it also left me with more questions.  After everything that this geisha had gone through, I wanted to know more!
