 I have to say that Sylvia Browne is a great author and a blessing to the literary community. But, her work "Astrology Through a Psychic's Eyes" fails to do justice to her writing abilities. The book is interesting, but I wouldn't say that it's a must-have. It's extremely short, offering an overview on the personalities of the different sun signs. Browne's sense of humor gives energy to the book, but even that isn't enough to pull it through. I read it in about an hour (probably less) and never looked at it again. I'd say that her assessment of an Aries (my sign) is only partially true to my personality, and I was disappointed that Sylvia couldn't come any closer to the truth than the sun sign profiles I've found on the internet. My recommendation: borrow the book from a friend or from the library; buying it definitely isn't worthwhile.
