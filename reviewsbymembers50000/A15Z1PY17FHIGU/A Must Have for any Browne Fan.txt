 I absolutely love this book. I've read it once already and am reading it for a second time. It really helped me to deal with the breakup of my boyfriend and I, and it gave me a lot of hope for the future. I've read many of Browne's other works, and I didn't find this one too repetitive. Sure, she covers some of the same ground as in her other books (mainly to benefit 1st time readers), but she does so very briefly. I can't say enough good things about "Wisdom and Comfort..." It really is inspiring. Even if you don't believe in her theories, her advice is practical and helpful. She discusses how to deal with grief, when and how to forgive others, how to choose a mate (wisely), ect. "Wisdom and Comfort..." is amazing. You won't regret buying it.
