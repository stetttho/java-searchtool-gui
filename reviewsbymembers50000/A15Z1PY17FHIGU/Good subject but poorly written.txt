 I have lived in Chautauqua my entire life and am currently attending Fredonia State. I am a firm believer in spiritualism, and while reading "Lily Dale", I was extremely offended by Mrs. Wicker's attitude. She implied several times that those who believe in psychic phenomena are crazy, or somehow not normal, and while she is entitled to her own opinions, she has to keep her audience in mind. I did not feel as though Wicker was respectful of my beliefs, and as a consequence, I felt no inclination to respect hers. That said, there were some very interesting stories regarding conjuring the dead, and I enjoyed the history of Lily Dale. However, the interweaving stories concerning individual accounts of Lily Dale were interspersed throughout the book and were confusing. One would expect more from a seasoned journalist.
