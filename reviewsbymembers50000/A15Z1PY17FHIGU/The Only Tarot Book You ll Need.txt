 I've made frequent attempts to study the tarot, and found it extremely difficult. However, after I visited the author's website, I began to have a new understanding of the tarot. Her meanings are presented in a format that's easy to use and are extremely accurate. The exercises in the book enable the reader to gain a deeper understanding of the tarot. The exercises are optional, not mandatory, which allows the reader to pick and choose without missing out on anything. Visit www.learntarot.com to check out the book, which is virtually a copy of the webpages. I bought the book because it's easier to use than connecting to the internet everyday and also because Bunning is such an amazing teacher, that I want to support her work. There is also an option to contact the author with any questions. I own numerous tarot books and this is the only one that I use. If you're serious about learning the tarot, buy this book. You won't regret it.
