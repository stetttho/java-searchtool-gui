 This book has helped motivate me to overcome my shyness and depression. Russianoff is a knowledgable yet understanding author...it's like talking to your ideal best friend! The book relates to so many areas of my life. Almost every chapter has dealt with something close to my heart. I plan to read it over and over again so that I can fully absorb Russianoff's lessons and incorporate them into my life. This is the greatest self-help book I've read!
