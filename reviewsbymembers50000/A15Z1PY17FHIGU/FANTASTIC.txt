 This is my new favorite movie! (...) I actaully caught it on Showtime one night, and was mesmerized by the storyline. It was unpredictable, the characters were interesting, and I couldn't stop watching. In fact, I stayed up until 1 am the next morning to watch it again. I'm even considering buying the DVD for a friend. See this movie. It won't disappoint.
