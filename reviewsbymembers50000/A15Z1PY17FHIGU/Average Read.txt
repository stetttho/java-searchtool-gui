 I was somewhat disappointed with this book. It didn't contain as many layouts as I expected and its definitions of the cards were somewhat lacking in breadth. However, the book spoke in simple terms and broke down the cards into their suits and numbers so that their meanings were easier to understand. I learned the significance of higher or lower numbers predominating in a spread, as well as black or red cards. This book has added to my knowledge of cartomancy, but I probably wouldn't buy it again.
