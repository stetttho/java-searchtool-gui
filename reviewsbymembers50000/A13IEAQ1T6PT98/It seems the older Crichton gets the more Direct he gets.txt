 Looking over his older books, He has a degree of "Man overestimates his importance on the Planet", but the more he writes, the more it gets away from a story.  Jurassic Park,  has a lot of stuff in it about his message about the use of Science, but it helps the Story about people trapped on an island with raging dinosaurs.  State of Fear is not so much a story, as it is a dissertation. I could sum the whole "story" up in a few lines. It feels more like a trip through Mr. Roggers Neighborhood, on "About our Planet Day". There is a lawyer who goes a bunch of places, and keeps running into people who "Explain" stuff to him, or someone else, next to him about environment, nature, history, and control.  Very interesting stuff. He (as always) did his research, and makes a very compelling argument. My guess is, that he would have wanted this to go in non-fiction, but decided he'd get more readers if it was an action book. There is about 3 pages of Action. He added those, to get people to buy it.  Good stuff, and a lot to think about.  My suggestion: Get this book on MP3. That way you're not wasting time, sitting around reading it. Instead you can drive, work your garden, clean, etc. Think of it as Talk Radio. You are not stepping into a different world, you're mearly absorbing information.
