 Heat. Heat is your friend. Cold is the enemy.  I take this snowboarding. You CAN NOT use the Beltclip  carry case for this, if you are in the cold. Place it  in your pocket, with a Heat pack. I have walked out the door with a FULLY charged battery,  only to see the Red, Battery dying light. Ignor this. If you keep it warm, it will last longer. The hotter the battery is, the longer it lasts. I have gotten many photos after the red light, by  turning the camera on, the quickly snapping a photo,  then turning it off. And keeping the camera warm, when not in use.  YOU NEED A SECOND BATTERY!!!! Taking about 40 pictures at Disnaey World, will  use up ONE battery, if your fussing with the camera  on, and looking at the picture you took.  Just for your help. :)
