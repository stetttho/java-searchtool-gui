  If you are looking for story, then you can see ether one of these. They are both good. It's a story about a hot girl who is left alone in a small town, during the war, and all the bad stuff she has to deal with because of her looks. There are 2 stories here.  One is the town's inability to accept someone so Hot. The women hate her, and call her a slut. The men trick her, bribe her, and force her into bed.  The second story is about a 12 year old boy who is starting to notice women, and of course, he notices Monica Bellucci (Matrix Reloaded). His constant fantasies about her are driving his friends, and family mad, and are all the nude scenes that are added back into this UNCUT version.   If you are looking just for a story, then see ether version. If you are looking for Monica Bellucci naked, then see this. The reason that is was cut, is because it is illegal in the US to show  underage children in sexual situations. The 12 year old boy in constant fantasies with her naked, is just that. And those are the only real nude scenes of her.  Good story ether way.  If you like this, you will also like Midnight clear. Another good WW2 film.
