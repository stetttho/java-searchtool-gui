 I just pluged it into my Mac, and it worked. i love mac, sometimes. :) the sound is far better then other headset mics, I've tried. I use it to recoed voices, for Animation. You can even whisper, and it sounds clear. A very good choice for Mac.  I use it only for recording voices. i have a different set I use for gaming. One that will not fall off. I bought this for recording voices. That is why i don't care if it only has one Headphone.  My review is for the Mic only. i love it.
