 One of the best first person shooters out there. This is intense! I bought a 5 button mouse for this game. The Logitech wireless mouse. You will need it. If you liked Metal Of Honor, then moved to Call of Duty, THIS is your next step. In Call of Duty you work with your squad to get things done. You worry about hitting your own guys. This takes it a step further. You are in hell, and you need to use control. Lots of it. Not only do you constantly give commands to your 4 man fire team, you also have to NOT shoot civilians. With people running out of every door, some want to kill you, others want to run away, you  need to check your targets. Also the enemy is not in a bunker, they are EVERYWHERE. You see 4 guys and move in on them, only to have a truck drive up the alley you are in and shoot at you, or the window above the door you're in, has a sniper in it. Very Tough. Also there is an emotion engine in the game. You can rush up, killing the enemy, and freak them out. They will also throw back your grenades, or take up firing a mounted gun after you kill the previous guy who maned it.  Good game. Lots of levels. Complicated. Takes some getting used to. Prepare to die.... a LOT. Think of Black Hawk Down.
