 I got this game, because I was over my Mom's house for the holidays. I figured there was going to be some down-time, and she had a PC  with NO games. This was great for going in and taking down some  small Dinosaurs  for a quick fix. Then (after getting my Stepdad,  and brother hooked), we  would go on a much more aggressive hunt, like  after Raptors. Watch the  wind. Other animals are on the island, and  not all of them are plant  eaters. Everything moved smooth, and you  can choose how dense you want the  foliage, and how sensitive you  want the animals to sight, sound, and  smell. I wish the directions  were more then just a few pages, though.  I  never got to the BIG  carnivores, but it seemed that there should be more  interaction  with the dinosaurs amongst themselves. (i.e.. getting eaten  and all that). All and all a very fun game.
