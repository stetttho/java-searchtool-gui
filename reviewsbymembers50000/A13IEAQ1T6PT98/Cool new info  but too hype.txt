 Lots of new info, and a cool way of figuring things out. I really like the animatronic shark. If you like sharks, then you need to watch this. It's a cool video.  That said, it is NOT National Geographic, or Discovery Channel. It's more like Fear Factor. If you can stand watching Fear Factor for 2 hours, then this is for you. The editing, direction, music, everything Screams: Fear Factor. Because it was made for TV, it has the commercial pauses. But before the break, they tell you what's coming up. Then after the break, they recap Everything that has happened so far, PLUS a glimpse of what is coming up, before getting on with the story.  The most irritating thing about this video, is the fact that they show the one camera (underwater) of the shark biting the guy's leg about 40 times. They show that he was doing an interview. There were about 4 cameras shooting from various angles above water, and at least 2 underwater. To see it from the other camera views just a few times, would have been nice. But they never show them.  I'm telling you, it's Fear Factor. It even has the strobing light they use, to show how cool something is.
