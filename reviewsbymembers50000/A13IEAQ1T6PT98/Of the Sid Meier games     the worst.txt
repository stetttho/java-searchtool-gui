 Get one of the other games Sid Meier made before this one. Civilization is MUCH better.  THIS game takes everything from Civilization and dumbs it down. Most of the stuff is exactly the same, except they gave new names for them (future names). Wow. you guys are inventive. Instead of having around 12 races you can choose from in civilization, you get 9. All are extremely predictable, even the shuffling of character types does nothing. They should of had it shuffle several basic traits in the characters, not just their pictures. If you run into the religious zealot, no matter what the picture or name, you know how they are going to react to everything. They are just too predictable. Also, the game takes about a month of gaming to finnish, and at that point you want to stuff it in a box and never look at it again. I gave mine away after several started games, and 2 finished ones. I say again: get Civilization instead. It's a shame they don't make many good Turn based strategy games. :(
