 This game had all the makings of a cool game, but they botched it. I'm sorry to say I never made it past the 5th mission. Problems: Sound. It's like the Sims. everyone talks in gibberish.  Mission play has ONE combination that works. That is BAD. In each mission you get a few Ghosts that are pre-picked. BUT... you have other ghosts you can buy, or when you rescue ghosts from houses, they join your team, and are selectable for other missions. Now, I was hopping that I could accomplish a mission with ghosts of MY choosing. NOT.  The computer chooses a few ghosts for your mission, but if you like another ghosts, because you LIKE him, you  will not be able to complete the mission. You NEED the ghosts that are "Suggested". This sucks. Why buy a ghost, if you can't use him till the comp says so? There should be multiple ways of completing missions, and i have tried many things, I feel should work. They don't. ONLY the right combination, and order, of choices will get you through. This game lasted a week for me, and that is only because I really wanted it to be fun. Graphics are cool.
