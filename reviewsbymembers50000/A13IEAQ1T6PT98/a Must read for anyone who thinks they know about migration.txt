 This is one of those rare books, that should be mandatory reading, by anyone who wants to open their mouth about immigration. This book is laid out in a very articulate, non-agenda, balanced view of the state of immigration in the united states regarding Mexico. If you are  For or Against Undocumented workers (those with no formal US citizenship), then you should take a look at Mexifornia.  All sides are looked at. It is quite apparent that the writer was very concerned with not offending anyone too much. After reading, or listening to, many political books, this is by far one of the least "preachy". It lays out the facts, as seen through the eyes of a  Peach Farmer in Southern California, and scholar of immigration history.  It also gives you a Democratic point of View, a Republican point of view, a Big business point of view, Liberal point of view, town view, country view, worker view, old migrant view, new new migrant view. Even a point of view from both male and female migrants. And the differences in past migration, and present. Very thorough.   A Very good book. A must Read (or better yet, get the audio book)
