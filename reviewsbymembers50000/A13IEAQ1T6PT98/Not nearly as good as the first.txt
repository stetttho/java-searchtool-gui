 This game is kind of a disappointment. True, it has a lot of cool new stuff, but unlike the older Civilization games, it lacks a lot of play ability. First of all, there are less tribes (in here they are called Factions). The factions are ALWAYS the same. The traits are too eccentric to make the game play very interesting. Once you figure out who is in love with the land, you know how to treat them. Once you figure out who is a Zealot,  you can get them. You can do a randomize on the characters, but all it does is change their face. Once they start talking, you know who they were originally. I played this game about 4 times. The last game I played, I stopped halfway through, because I was far enough ahead to render any more playing moot. I set off a nuke (which is by far the coolest thing in the game) then quit, because everyone turns against you, at once. This game has SUCH potential. Stick with Civilization 1,2,&3, you will be MUCH happier.      All I really wanted was Civilization to go a little further. Get into space ships, and space station battles, have shield bases, lasers, undersea cities, that sort of thing. But they just changed the look and name of all the stuff, and called it a new game. It seems like they even took things out.
