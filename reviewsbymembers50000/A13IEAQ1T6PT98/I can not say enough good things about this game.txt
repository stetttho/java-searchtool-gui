 I can not say enough good things about this game. It's super fun for all ages. I bought this game for my nephews and they actually put down their PSPs to play it! I play against my girlfriend some times, but my friends have also begun to take interest in it. You have a map of America, with cities and other bonus spaces on it. You have a monster (one of 6 to choose from) from the classic 1950's monster films. You also get one of the 4 Branches of Military. After playing once, it gets addictive. It requires luck of dice rolling, strategy of Military movement (you only get 8 units for each Branch), and trash talking to get other players to go after another player's monster instead of yours. At the end of the "regular" game (which is Monsters Vs. Military) you go Monster Vs. Monster in an all out monster battle, to see who is the most powerful monster! Kicks butt. Get this game.  My only complaint is it is only for 4 players. We use the National Guard as a 5th player if we have more people. There are 6 monsters to choose from, only 4 (not counting National guard) military branches.  The other games my friends, nephews, etc. like to play is called Dread Pirate. Get that as well. Simple and fun. And it's got Pirates in it, so.... good choice.  If you like this game, then you will like War of the Monsters PS2, and Destroy All Humans  PS2
