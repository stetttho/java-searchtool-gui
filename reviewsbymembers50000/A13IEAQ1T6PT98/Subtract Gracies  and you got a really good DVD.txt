 After watching these fights, I would never train under the Gracies. If you have a x2 PLAY button on your DVD, USE it. All the Gracies spend about 90% of the fight on their backs, and do absolutely Nothing when on top.  It's almost like they are stunned to realize they are in a good position.  Watch the first 30 seconds of any of the Gracie fights, and you get the idea. Then, x2 or x4 if you got it.  The other fights are a lot better, and worth watching. A long time ago, the Gracies were unstoppable, but now..... Any standup fighter with more then 6 months of ground training could beat them. Main method of attack: Lay on your back like a turtle, wrap your legs in the guard, then hope your opponent gets tired of hitting you, and passes out. I would never even pay a regular rental fee for this one.  Also, the commentary is only good when the fights start. The Japanese put on a spectacular show, before the fight, but it's ruined by not having a translator or subtitles, and then having the commentators just saying over, and over, and over again "Wow........ Wow. I wish you were here. Wow. This is like a movie. Wow..... I can't believe this..... wow...... This is amazing.."
