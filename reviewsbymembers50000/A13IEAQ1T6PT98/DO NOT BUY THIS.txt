 This set sucks. When I bought it, I thought I was getting all the NG shows on 7 disks. Just like the TIME LIFE: WORLD AT WAR collection. That is a box set with 5 disks and 6 titles on each disk. THIS is their pick of what THEY think is great. The Ultimate National Geographic DVD Collection contains: 7 disks: 1) 30 Years Of National Geographic 2) Nature's Fury 3) Secrets Of The Titanic 4) Surviving Everest 5) The Battle For Midway 6) The Photographers 7) Tigers Of The Snow  So you pay $150  for 7 disks (that's $21/ per disk) and you don't get to choose which ones. You are better off buying them separately, and picking the ones you like.  Ultimate it is NOT.
