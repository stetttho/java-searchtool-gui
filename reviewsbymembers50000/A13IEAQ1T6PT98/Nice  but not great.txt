 I like the picture. It matches my Desktop Image, but for an Optical mouse pad it's not the best. I had a soft, smooth, tie-dye-looking mouse pad, before. I had to give it up, because I got another computer, and My girlfriend wanted to keep the pad.  1) This mouse pad is Hard. It's made out of some super hard plastic.  2) It has a Texture to it. It feels like those opaque windows they put in public bathrooms. The rough ones. With that texture, I can Hear every mouse move I make (srcaaap.... srutt... scrruutt... scrape).  3)The Optical mouse gets lost around the crest of the wave, where the image has a large white spot.  4) Although it says OPTICAL MOUSE PAD here. It actually says "Can be used with Optical Mouse" On the package. Meaning that it's POSSIBLE to use the optical mouse, not that it's MADE for the optical mouse.   The pad is Useable, but not what I hoped for. I like the image, and it works for Large movements. If you need Exact sensitivity, then look elsewhere.
