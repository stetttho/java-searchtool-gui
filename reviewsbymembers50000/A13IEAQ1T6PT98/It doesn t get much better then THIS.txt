 Just sucked me in after a few paragraphs. I could not put this book down.  Every time someone saw me, they saw me reading ARMOR. I've read it  more  then once, and can only say: I wish it was Longer.  After reading this I  ran to the store to find that there were no other stories of this kind By  John Steakley.  I read SPHERE, then ENDER'S GAME, then STARSHIP TROOPERS in  hope of a similar "high".   ENDER'S GAME was very cool. S.T.  dealt a lot with training and philosophy (but it was still great book. I  only wish the movie was more like ARMOR). I'm  hoping for a Sequel or a  Prequel. Just don't ruin the characters. Maybe a story that happens in the  same universe, but a different guy. Or detail the first big battle, when  the bugs came to Earth. ARMOR as the story of Felix, stands fine (as HIS  story) all by itself. I bought around 8 copies of this book for friends,  and they all Loved it!
