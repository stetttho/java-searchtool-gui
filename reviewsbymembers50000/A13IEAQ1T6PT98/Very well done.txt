 The guy at the store recommended this, and I was a bit skeptical. I loved the cut scenes, and the whole style of the game. If you are into the 1940-50s style retro horror film thing, then you will love this game. The humor is fun, and sarcastic. It IS however, more adult humor then you want your 8yr old playing with. 15... maybe. It's a chase camera (tomb raider, GTA, MGS, Hitman, etc) The controls are very simple, and easy to get the hang of. There is a tutorial as you play. The voice of one of the aliens you may recognize as ZIM!!! Yes! Invader Zim! And the humor is on the same level as that cartoon. There are the main missions, and then there are the Side missions. In each town you have these probes you must find, and they are not easy to find. They do let you know how many are left, though. There are also mini missions in each town, signaled by an orange beam from the sky. The only problem I have with these, is that they are mostly the same in every town. They could have made some different missions. They are mainly "Get 5 brains in 2 minutes", "Kill 12 civilians in 1 minute" "Race from one location to another" So.... a lot like Zim plying GTA.  They put a lot of different thoughts in the heads of the common folk for you to read, even so, they get repetitive after a while. I'm sure they tried to come up with a lot, but when you spend a lot of time as hollo-Bob you start hearing the same ones over and over. I think each person you read, has about 4 thoughts.  Also, people you kill, respawn once you get outside shooting range of them. So don't think you can clean sweep the whole town.  If you like this game, then you will like War of the Monsters PS2, and Monsters Menace America (board game)
