 I like pirate games, and one of the parts that are always overlooked is the sea battles. This game Rules! The fun of this game is in it's simplicity. You can explain the rules to anyone in just under a minute. I have plenty of games that are fun, but many take too long for anyone with a short attention span (kids) to get the rules. Every player starts in a port. They roll dice to move. If you land next to another port or another player, you can roll for a "skirmish" The highest die roll wins. you take their gems if you win. When you have one of each color gem, you can land on Dread island and get free treasure (it's like Free Parking  in monopoly). the first there gets the Dread Pirate flag, which gives them an extra die to roll for moving. When all the gems are removed from the islands, the game is over, and each player counts their treasure. The highest wins. Parcheesi, Trouble, Life, Yahtzee, etc all have similar aspects of rolling dice and dealing with the results. The whining about dice rolls seems childish. It's a game. It's not educational, but it IS very interactive. We always have people bargaining and pleading with each other to shift the game play.  There are also areas you must pass through (like Bermuda Triangles) and you draw a chance card. You can also add the WIND die into your dice rolls. This can greatly shift the outcome of the game.  This can also be a very good drinking game, where... if  you loose a battle, you drink.  The cool metal ships, the strong wooden box, the cloth board, the glass Gems, and METAL Doubloons, make this game a MUST buy.
