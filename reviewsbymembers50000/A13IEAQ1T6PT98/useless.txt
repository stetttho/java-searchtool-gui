 I had one of these things for a while. I loved it. Now they "improved" it. They made it more sensitive. What a nightmare! It used to have a 6'-10' range, now it sences eveything with in a 30' range. I was using it to keep one of my cats out of a corner that she liked to pee in. If I set up the new one, she can't even walk through the room. They should have put a control on this to adjust the distance that it picks up the collar's signal. I really wish the old one had not broken. :(
