 Right. First off, i bought this thing, figuring it would work with my G5 iMac. I was wrong. Or logitech was shamefully lacking in their info for Mac users. It SAYS it can work with a Mac, but all I got was the headphones to work. I had to run out, and pick up this Egg looking thing, called iVoice2. It plugs into your USB slot, and allows you to use ANY PC mic/headset with your mac. It is $35-$50 (depending on where you buy it). But, on plus side, after you buy the iVoice2 from Macally, you can use ANY PC headset  with mic you want. :)  Now, on with the headset. This headset is a bit uncomfortable. I like the  behind the ears headsets, but this one is made for big heads, or Large hair. It has the advantage of not being able to fall off, but it feels loose.  The mic is great. It doesn't reach your mouth. It stops about 2/3rds of the way, but it does pick up some nice clear sound. I use it for recording voices for animation and small games I make. You DO need to turn up the GAIN in your computer, but after that, it's GOLD. The sound is clear,rich, and not Hissy. i prefer the mic to be closer to the mouth, because you have to speak up, to get nice levels. If you whisper, you will get  recorded, but you will have to amplify it later in post, and my get some hiss.  All and all, a good product. At the price, you can't do much better. The long cord is also a plus, when you have people reading from a script, and  don't want them hunched over a table to speak into a desk mic.  Another cool feature, is that the shields on the sides come off, and it comes with  4 colors to place there (black, red, blue, orange), So you know which is yours.  A better mic is the Plantronics DSP-100. It's USB, and has only one head phone, but it sound beautiful. It also costs $45.
