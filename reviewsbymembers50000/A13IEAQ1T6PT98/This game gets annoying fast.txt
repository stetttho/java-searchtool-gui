 This game gets annoying fast.  It has so much potential. Problem is, it's way too much micro managing. Not only are you trying to keep all your resources coming in, you are trying to get all of you crew to like each other. I lasted a week on this game. I thought  the building of the space port was cool. Personally i thought this was going to be like Sim City. It' not. It's very  annoying. The sound effects alone get on your nerves real quick. I had a big port, and lots of nice equipment and hotel. This gave me so much money I could train all my people to be super efficient, and create lots of fast robots to work. I STILL didn't have enough time to get my people to like one another. Rent this game. If you last more then a few days, buy it. If you DO buy it, save the receipt.
