 If this CD was put out by anyone else, I would have given it 4 stars. But Tanya Donelly is MUCH better then this CD shows. If you like Belly, and LOVE SONGS FOR UNDERDOGS, then you  may not like BEAUTYSLEEP. If you like Tracy Thorn, or EVERYTHING BUT THE GIRL, or The slow songs that MATCHBOX TWENTY  sings, then you will love this CD. It's slow, and not very creative. There are no Little birds, Broken Angels, see-through dogs, frogs for friends, screamers, spacemen, or Girls with silver smiles, in the CD. It all seems like a diary she wrote while having a dull relationship with some guy. EVERY SONG on this album is SLOW. Let me say that again; EVERY Song on this album is SLOW. Her past CDs had some variety, and even the sad songs had a bit of Rock to them. Any of Dido's  CDs have more uplifting songs then BEAUTYSLEEP. BEAUTYSLEEP, despite having the Beautiful, dreamy voice of Tonya Donelly, will leave you a bit flat. Normally, I can pick a few songs out that really stand out, the first time around, but this took a few listening to get me to like it. I like this CD, but it's not what I was hoping for. I like her past stuff. Check out Belly's Greatest Hits. Sweet Ride is a great song. Oh, And this has one of those stupid "hidden" songs on it. You know, The last song on the CD has a 5 minute pause between it and the REAL last song on the CD. Makes it bad for Random Play on your CD player.
