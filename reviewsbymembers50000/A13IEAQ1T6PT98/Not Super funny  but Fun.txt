 This is a perfect film for playing in the background at a party. There is nothing in this film that requires any thought, what so ever. The two guys get stoned, then take off to white castle. If you like Austin Powers, Dude Where's my Car, License To Drive, Scary Movie, Undercover brother, or Dumb and Dumber,  then you will like this. This film tries to out do Dumb and Dumber's  Diarrhea scenes, with Two girls battling for who can make the biggest splash. Yuck! The disgusting parts, are just a bit Too disgusting. You can scan Though the Girls on the Toilets, but JUMP over the Hillbilly, named Freakshow. The rest of the film is playful, and twisted, and yeah... funny. There is no real "Laughing out loud, I got to rewind that and see it again" scenes, unless you are talking about the nudity. There are glimpses of girls flashing, throughout the film. (just enough to keep the male audience's attention). Austin Powers made me Laugh out loud, and Dumb and Dumber did Once. This film is like a heavy chuckle at times, or a "What the?....."  Everyone goes on about how the two main characters, being Non-White is of any importance. They are just Guys. Who Cares? They could put anyone in these rolls, and it would work. These two, do a great job, though. And the jokes, are for everybody. It's not like Soul Plane, where the jokes are aimed at a focused group of  viewers. They touch on may stereo types, but they don't beat you over the head with "inside" jokes.  Good film. Not Super funny, but Fun.
