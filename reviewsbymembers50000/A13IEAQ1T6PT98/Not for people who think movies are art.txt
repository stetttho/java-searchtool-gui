 If you liked The Relic, Deep Blue sea, Deep Star Six, Daylight, Anaconda, or Resident Evil, you will  love this Film. It's fun, the actors did as good a job as they could be expected to in a monster film, and it was shot very well. It would not quite rate as a B film, because there is no nudity, no dumb one-liners, and no hookers with machine guns. This is not Ghosts of Mars, or Demon Night. As far as the film goes, it's fun. There are no Jump-out-at-you parts, no false scares. Just people trying to get out of a cave filled with water, as they get picked off one by one.
