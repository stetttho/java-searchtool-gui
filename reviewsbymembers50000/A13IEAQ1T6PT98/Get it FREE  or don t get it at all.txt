 First off, I'm going to say I don't like this software, but it's very hard to find ANY software that can do what this DOES do. That said, this is the lowdown: CONS: I'm doing the cons first, because THAT is what is getting me to write this. -- Nothing is finished. I'm not sure where PRO comes in, but         you can't create anything to a finished piece. a) The home design has no toilets, bathtubs, sinks, cabinets, beds, fans. etc. b) The Garden design has no Stepping stones, ponds, rocks, waterfalls,  designer walls.  -- You can alter any of the textures to make your own "designer" Textures. This is lame. Everything is a half-tool in this program. I found a CONCRETE I liked but it was too dark. I take it into the custom menus. There, there are sliders for  RED, Green, Blue. The Concrete is a middle gray, and all the sliders are set to 255, 255, 255.  That's the MAX brightness, for every slider. I clicked on other textures, and Every texture is the same. When you bring them into the custom menu, they are all 255,255,255. SO, that means that you can ONLY make things DARKER. WHY!!!?!??!? Most of the textures I liked, I just needed them to be a bit LIGHTER. there is NO way of doing this.  -- I tried to make my stepping stones..... They have a 3D editor to create your own stuff. A stepping stone is a cylinder. They have that as a basic shape, so this should be easy, right? Wrong.  I create a stone 1' x 1' x 2", when I click enter, it converts to 8.2' x 8.2' x 2.5". I go into the Object editor, and click SIZE. Everything in here is a half-tool, remember? So I can enter a number for length, and height, but guess what, no WIDTH. That's right.  -- Garden design.... I draw out my house outer wall, and then create a property line. You can add textures to the ground. Now each outline you make is basically a flat piece os geometry. So if you make a big square, and THINK you are making a little square in it as a cement landing, you are wrong. Both are still there. You never CUT into the original piece. So now you have TWO squares fighting over who's textures get displayed. This causes flickers.  -- When making a long rectangle, and deciding to cut it into 2 squares, you will never do this. It will always recognize it as ONE piece. You have to shrink the original to the shape you want, then create a new piece next to it.    a) This is the same with INSIDE WALLS. If you have a long wall running down your     house, and two bedrooms share that wall. In one room that wall is white, and in the next,     it's green. Not in THIS program. You paint that green, and every room all the way down      the hall, now has a green wall.  -- In my back yard there is cement, then 6" down, there is a garden. You can't move things in 6" units. Only 1 foot.  -- Plants. I got this to plant a garden, and found out that all the plants, and there are a LOT, only come in ONE photo. So the whole AGE YOUR PLANTS to see what stuff will look like in a few years, is wrong. They just scale it up. So If I plant Bamboo, in my yard, it will come as a big jumble of shafts, and never spread, only get larger and more pixely.  --Personally, I have seen more flexibility in THE SIMS.  --Oh GOD, yeah, the walk through, is horrible, it's almost impossible to control the camera. After all of us have played QUAKE, trying to get the hang of this 3D engine, is like making us ride a bike with only one leg, and one arm.    --I figured out why the company's name is PUNCH. After 10 minutes with this software you'll want to punch someone.  --Whenever you click on a new tool, the icon conveniently turns into the tool you clicked. (ie. Wall, door, window)   This is great, to know what you are doing, but lousy for DOING what you are doing. You have no idea where you line is going to start. Is it the top corner of the Door Icon, or maybe in the middle, possibly a bit up and to the right of the icon.  -- anyone touting the Greatness of this software is a SHAM, who works for Punch.  -- The materials window, that allows you to place a material on any surface is WAY to small to hit anything accurately.    PROS: It's interesting to have a blueprint of your house with all the measurements, even if it has no bathroom or kitchen.  It makes it easier to shop for carpet, sofa, drapes, etc.   -One thing good is the Video Tutorial on each button. When you click a button, you can R/Click to get a Tutorial. This is great to figure out the uses of the buttons. BUT, it doesn't cover EVERY button.  ** I'd like to see a tutorial on how to make a simple house, and how to make a raised house, or a split level home.
