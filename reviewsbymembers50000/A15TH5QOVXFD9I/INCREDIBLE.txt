 What an amazing book! If you're tired of the same old formula when it comes to historical romance then you'll love yourself for getting a copy of After the Storm. This story has everything! From time travel, to humor, to intense emotion and erotic sensuality this book is a definite keeper. In the present day Maya Jones is one of the worlds leading anthropologists. After unearthing some amazing artifacts from an ancient scottish castle, Maya finds herself drawn inexplicably to the story of the Laird of the castle. Thinking of taking a small vacation Maya and a friend find themselves participating in a hurricane party on the coast of Florida where *poof!* she and her best friend are swallowed up by the storm and transported through a wormhole into ancient Scotland! Using her understanding of ancient peoples Maya and her friend become part of an ancient and fearsome clan the MacGregors!  Most amazing is that Maya finds herself as drawn to Laird MacGregor in the flesh as her historical view of the Laird. She's never known a more virile or exasperatingly stubborn man. Hilarious hijinks ensue as Maya and the Laird take turns pursuing each other, forging an earth shattering love that spans through the ages and gives birth to a dynasty. I also recommend Before the Fire also by Tia Isabella and any and all books by Jaid Black.
