 Start with this book and work your way down Jaid Black's list. There's no avoiding it...once you read Black you never go back. Seriously this series is one of the best futuristic/paranormal romance reads in print. Not for the faint of heart by any stretch of the imagination, make sure you have a cool drink near by for these incredibly hot sex scenes. While sex and sexuality make up for a core strength in this author's work, you'll be amazed at how well she involves you in the plot structure and characterization of the new reality she has created. This is not your run of the mill erotica...this is Romantica! If you like Dara Joy or Christine Feehan you'll LOVE Jaid Black.
