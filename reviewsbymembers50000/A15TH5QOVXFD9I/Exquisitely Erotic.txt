 Jaid Black's amazing talent with words never ceases to amaze me. She knows exactly how to draw a reader into the storyline and make the characters on the page come alive. Her Trek M'Qan series has kept me spellbound from beginning to end, and left me hungry for more. Her futuristic reality keeps getting more and more amazing with each installment. I can't wait for the next one. Keem 'em coming!
