 Whew! It's been a long time since I've read so original a book. This book takes us on a fantastic journey through time fraught with perils and unexpected adventures. The main characters Kane and George have intense chemistry and understand each other on a realistic and loving level. You won't believe they're really a work of fiction. The time travel aspect of the story is handled well and realisticly and the plot is very original. In future Earth the population is diying from a brain plague that makes AIDS look like the sniffles. There is plant that has properties that could cure this devastating disease...there's just one problem. This plant has been extinct for hundreds of years. So Kane, a warrior woman/biologist must travel back in time to obtain samples of this plant in order to save her world. In past Earth George Wyndom the Earl of Blackmore is stuck between a rock and a hard place. He must find a wife to beget his heirs. He must find a suitable wife soon or his mother will foist an insipid nightmare into his marriage bed. While riding through his property and brooding over his problem he stumbles upon an incredible...naked beauty. He falls instantly in love/lust and his life turns upside down. Little does he know that the woman of his dreams is also from the future! Will he be able to help her fulfill her quest...even though it will mean losing her to the future? Be ready to laugh until you cry this book is full of hilarious surprises and wonderful characters. You'll hate it when the book comes to an end. I also recommend Before the Storm also by Tia Isabella and any and all books by Jaid Black.
