 This book is choc full of erotic tales of the paranormal. There's a tale of a sexual and deviant Vampire and his bloodlust for one lucky mortal woman, a tale of a warlock and his soulmate, and (my fave)the tale of a gargoyle/vampire and his destined mate. I hated when this book ended, and I can't wait to read more like it. These women writers of the erotic genre really know how to pen an alpha male. And how!!
