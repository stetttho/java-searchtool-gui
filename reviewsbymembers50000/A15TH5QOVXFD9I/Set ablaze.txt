 This was yet another triumph for Ms. Black. I just can't get enough of her incredible stories. God of Fire is the story of a young lady who is swept back in time by the ancient viking god Loki - and into the arms of her gorgeous dream man. Ragnor is a viking warrior like no other, and Dara can't refuse the heated attraction that flares between the two of them. In an adventure that spans centuries, these two people will learn what it is to love and be loved despite the odds against it. After reading this wonderfully sexy story you'll wish Loki would come down to earth and make mischief in your life!
