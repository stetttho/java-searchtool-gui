 If you've never read a Jaid Black book you have no idea what you've been missing. Her stories are original, erotic with a capital E, and full of surprises. Her heroes are to die for, her heroines are strong and a far cry from the usual insipid young ladies you're used to finding in romances. If you're faint of heart or used to recyled romantic mush this book is not for you. However if you're looking for a great way to spend an evening with some chocolates and cooling fan you have to read Ms. Black's work. This book is one of her best, but be prepared for a cliff-hanger ending!
