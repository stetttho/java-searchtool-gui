 You have to read this author! I cannot decide my favorite among her books. This books was wonderfully romantic and original. Ms. Moning's use of time travel was not in the normal 'heroine gets bonked on the head and finds herself in another time' plot format. It was unique and anything but familiar. Her heroes are to die for and her heroines are strong and intelligent. Definately worth the time and money, you'll wish you'd read them sooner.
