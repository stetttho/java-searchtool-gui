 This movie is a great new look at an old favorite. While character development could use a little more work - the subject matter is wonderfully scripted. The ideas behind Dracula's aversion to holy objects is a brilliant one. I only wish they had gone into it more deeply instead of ending it with a huge revelation. I hope there is a sequel.
