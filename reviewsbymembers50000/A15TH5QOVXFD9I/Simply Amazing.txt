 Jaid Black is one of the most talented authors around today. She has an amazing understanding of the human psyche, and is an expert at exposing the very nature of women and their most secret desires. She has a wonderful way of drawing the reader into her world until nothing else can exist for them but the characters and stories she has created. She doesn't use dried up, overused, hum-drum story lines at all, instead she creates something new and wonderful in each of her books that just makes you want to swoon with pleasure...and read more more more!! If you haven't read a Jaid Black novel then your life as a reader is just not complete. I reccommend all of her books, and even though I can't pick a favorite no matter how hard I try, this one is up there on my list. Keep 'em coming Ms. Black, and no doubt about it!
