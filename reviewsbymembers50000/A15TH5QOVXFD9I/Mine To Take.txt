 I've read all of the Matrix of Desiny book Ms. Joy has published thus far and have found each to be a thrilling, romantic adventure. The stories are the most original I have read in a long time. And the sex scenes!! They are anything but typical of the genre. I can't wait for the other books in this series. I hope she publishes them soon, or I'll go crazy with boredom! This author is an ABSOLUTE MUST READ!!!!!!
