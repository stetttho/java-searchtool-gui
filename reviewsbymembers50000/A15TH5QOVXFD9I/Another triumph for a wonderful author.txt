 If you've enjoyed Ms. Shayne's previous installments to this vampire series then you're sure to love this newest tale. Her previous tales in the Shadows line were good, but short and given little chance at plot development. Mira publishing has finally allowed Ms. Shayne the freedom to weave a completely developed storyline inside this full length novel, and it has paid off!  The characters are as interesting as the plot - don't let some of the other reviews fool you. Dante is no gentle or maleable lover...he is dark, dangerous and incredibly sexy! Morgan is lonely and diying from the very antigen in her blood that can draw her to Dante's embrace...if only Dante weren't so stubborn about resisting her to keep her safe and human.  Trust me, if you enjoyed Ms. Shayne's previous vampire tales at all, this book will draw you even more firmly into the fandom of her Twilight series.
