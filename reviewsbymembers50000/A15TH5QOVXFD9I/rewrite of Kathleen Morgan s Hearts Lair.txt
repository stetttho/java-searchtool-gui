 I liked reading this book, but it's basically the same book as Hearts Lair by Kathleen Morgan. Everything is similar including the cat-man green/gold eyed hero. Ms. Joy's book was more erotic but pretty much the same otherwise. The events in the first chapter with the hero being chained naked to a wall, drugged, and having the heroine find him thus are exactly the same between the two books. I liked the book mostly because it was a continuation of The Matrix of Destiny books, but it was very unoriginal, and I felt cheated after I read both Hearts Lair and Mine to Take back to back. I felt that Ms. Joy could have done better. I suggest that if you want the original story you read Hearts Lair by Kathleen Morgan and just enjoy Mine to Take as a continuation of a much better story line in the MOD series.
