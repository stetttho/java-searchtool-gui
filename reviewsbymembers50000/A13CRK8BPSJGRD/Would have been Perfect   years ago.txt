 I think Wiz 8 is a good game IF you are a fan of the Wiz series and have played the other games. If you are new, you will indeed, not get what all the fuss is about.  I can understand that it would be hard to jump into Wiz 8 and be excited by it. It does, on the surface, interact a whole lot like M&M. The graphics are OK, but nothing special or new. The story line is OK, but you appreciate it much more if you played Bane, Savant...etc.  This game will be loved by Wiz fans, like me, that waited years for the next (and sadly final) chapter in this series. But, if you are new to the Wizardry story line, weren't even alive when Wiz I came out, or think that games like Final Fantasy are examples of an RPG....you are too young and spoiled by technological advances to appreciate this game and the rest of us are too old and reflected to see its flaws.
