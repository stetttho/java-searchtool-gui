 Plus is pretty cool, but you don't get much for your money. You get games that are just playable demos that if you want more levels you have to purchase them. (at outrageous prices) You get like 4 themes. They are pretty neat, but 4? How about a few more? You get a cool Aquarium screen saver that is lifelike with cool graphics. But, you only get 4 fish. To get more fish you have to buy them (for like half the price of Plus) from Microsoft. XP is a good OS, so far I haven't had any problems, but Plus isn't half the upgrade Plus for Win95 was. Don't bother getting it. It is too expensive and there isn't much to it.
