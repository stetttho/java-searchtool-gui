 This isn't a bad game at all, but it isn't much of an improvement over 2001. It might not be an improvement at all. The commentary is better, but the game-play and graphics are pretty much the same. Also, a career mode is present, but it doesn't provide the depth necessary to make it a fun feature. The user interface used to view stats and edit lines is a bit cumbersome. For example: there is no quick way to switch a guy on SL1 with a guy on SL2. You have to go through and change each player separately. Not a big deal, but when you make a trade or someone gets hurt and they are on several lines, going through each one and changing it does take some time. The UI is one thing they should have left the same. I was hoping for a big jump forward from last year, but 2002 isn't. It is still a good game, but if you have 2001 you don't need this one.
