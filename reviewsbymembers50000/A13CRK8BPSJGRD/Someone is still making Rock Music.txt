 This album has an early rock flavor to it. Some songs sound early 60ish and all songs have a Beatles flavor to them. This album may be short by today's music standards, but "three minute or less" songs were the way most rock albums were until the early 80's. Weezer fans may be disappointed if they are looking for a "My name is Jonas" or "I'm Tired of Sex" kind of harder rock. The songs on this album are far and away the lightest Weezer thus far. I would have like a few "edgier" songs, but if you aren't frightened by the Beatles or Rolling Stones type rock this album should strike you quite nice.
