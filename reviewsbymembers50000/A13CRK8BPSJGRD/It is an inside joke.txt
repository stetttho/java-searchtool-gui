 If you have ever worked in an office, cubicle, or in computer technology you will find this movie hilarious. The only people that I have met that did not think this movie was funny were people who never worked in an office etc...There are many "inside" type jokes that you will only get if you can relate them to your own work experience. This movie will definitely become a cult favorite for the disgruntled office technology employee. Others might not get the entire joke.
