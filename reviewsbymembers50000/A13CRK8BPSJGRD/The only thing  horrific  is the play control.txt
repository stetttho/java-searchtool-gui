 If you like the original Resident Evil you will probably like this one for the most part. However, I liked the original Resident Evil, but found: Code Veronica extremely annoying.  The annoying part has nothing to do with the game itself. The puzzles are a bit bothersome at times, but nothing to complain about. The graphics aren't bad and the story line works pretty well. The BIG problem I have with the game is the play control. The editorial comment says "less than perfect controls", well that is an understatement. You have to hold down the right trigger to use your weapons, this makes firing while running and firing while retreating overly complex. Moreover, you have to go into the menu screen every time you want to pick up or use an item. There just had to be a better way. Most of the time I would say that the play control only diminishes the fun of the game, but doesn't ruin it. However, in this instance it does. The control sucks the fun out of the game just as the zombies do the blood out of your neck, while you are fumbling around with the controller. The game isn't very difficult, but the play control makes the game more work then it is worth.
