 Graphically superb. It is also challenging playing in single person mode. However, like most fighting games, the most fun is playing against one of your friends. This is the only real downside to the game. If you are a little skilled at the game you can put your opponent in a hold and make him tap out in only a few seconds. It takes a while to learn how to avoid these moves and if you not playing against someone who owns the game you will most likely just beat them very quickly match after match unless you agree that there are no submission holds allowed. So this isn't the type of game where you can just both get in the ring and beat on each other. It takes some practice to learn the special moves each fighter has and how to avoid submission holds. My only other critique is that the game manual does little to help you learn how to play. So it is pretty much a just learn as you go type thing. Other than that it is quite fun and entertaining. If you love fighting games you will like this one for sure. The standing, grappling, and submission positions add a depth that is currently unmatched by other fighting games.
