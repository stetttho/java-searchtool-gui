 Silver just doesn't cut it in my opinion. The story line is weak, predictable, and fragmented. The graphics aren't bad, but by no means are they ground breaking. There are also instances where you need binoculars to see the characters because they get so small.  I also felt that the play control could have been better arranged. While the game does not fail completely, it does come close. There are just better games to buy with your money, in my opinion.
