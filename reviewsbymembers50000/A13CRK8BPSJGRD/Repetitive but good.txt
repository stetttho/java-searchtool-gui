 Do not listen to anybody who gives this game less than 3 stars. Sure it is not perfect, but that is all relative. Compared to other RPGs, or what comport to be RPG's, (since no one makes a TRUE RPG anymore) Final Fantasy X is leaps and bounds ahead of the competition.  My only complaint is that the "spirit and pain of the earth" concept has run its course. Recent FF games seemed to try to develop their own religion more than convey and inspirational tale. I wish Square would return to a story writing similar to the original Final Fantasy or Final Fantasy II; with just crazy madmen trying to rule the world (not destroy it), and more emphasis on the kings, castles, knights etc. You can still have magic and "summoning" without all that "fighting for nature against the evil mechanized encroachment of man". That story has been repeated so much in the last few FFs that it has become a theme. It is time for Square to grow the story line as they have grown the graphics and character development. Either that, or they run the risk of having their own success constrict them into stagnant stories that become predictable and stale.
