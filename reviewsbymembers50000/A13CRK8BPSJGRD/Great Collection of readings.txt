 A great book for anyone into electrogravitics systems or with any real interest in new propulsion technology. This book is made up of several reports and writings pieced together. Some Physics is a must to understand this book. If you are not at all familiar with the some basic principles it will be hard to understand what much the book speaks of. The author takes for granted a certain level of Physics education and familiarity with the subject.  Only other thing is that this book takes about a month to get, but it is worth the wait.
