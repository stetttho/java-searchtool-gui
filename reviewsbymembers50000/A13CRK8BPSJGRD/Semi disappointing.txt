 Let me start off by saying I am a Blink fan and have been for a while. The songs on this album grow on you, but they are missing that something special that up till now was in every Blink album that set it apart from other pop punk bands. This album sounds too much like it was produced by someone other than the band and not homegrown as Blink's albums were in the past. The album is O. K, but without question the worst Blink has made thus far. There are just too many songs that are just mediocre and we have grown to expect more from Blink. Since it is hard to write about what the music sounds like I will just comment on some of the peculiar things I noticed about this album. First off the band blatantly rips themselves off. Which is beyond strange if you ask me. "Roller Coaster" and "Everytime" sound a whole lot alike. One songs' chorus sounds just like the other songs' verse. Also the riff in "Online Songs" is EXACTLY the same as "Boring" on the Dude Ranch album. I mean it is so obvious to anyone who has listened to the prior album. I am really not being picky about that. Just listen and you will nod your head in agreement. Lastly, the band is still talking about cutting class and high school. I know it is nice to reminisce, but come on...everybody knows that these guys are a little old for high school. It is time to write about something else. Blink fans will buy this album no matter what these reviews say (I sure did), but I was disappointed with this one. I hope on the next album Blink goes back to writing songs like they have all along.
