 It is way too short for a KOEI game. Even if there are 8 levels and not just 5 (which takes some work to unlock the extra characters and levels) we are still talking about only 8 levels. That is way too short. I have loved all kinds of KOEI games (from Ghengis Khan for the NES to Romance for the Station) all give hundreds if not thousands of hours of strategy game play. However, Dynasty gives you at best (and this is stretching it) 50-70 hours. That is if you use all the characters and really work your way through the entire game each time. However, the game is repetitive in nature, so doing basically the same thing with different officers each time gets tiresome.  Moreover, there really isn't a whole lot of strategy involved. You play as an officer. Basically, you go around and try to hack the opposing officers and protect your general. There is a bit of strategy, but it is all dependant on how well you are with the action fighting game play. Your character and his/her bodyguards get better as the missions go on, but any real war strategy (moving troops, angles of attack, etc.) are nonexistent. If you buy this game you will probably say what I did: "that was cool, but is this it?" Graphics are great and it is a great idea. However, there isn't and real strategy like I enjoyed in past KOEI games. There isn't anything that really requires you to think and try to figure out. So as a strategy game it just fails. As an action game, it succeeds, but like most action games its life span is relatively short.
