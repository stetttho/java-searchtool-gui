 This is a very solid album and worth the money if you are into pop-punk or emo. However, there are some problems with the album. I won't get into a lengthy discussion about it, but the songs fall shy of their full potential. For example on "Don't Hate Me" (Probably my favorite song on the album). The opening is missing something. You get the feeling that if they just added a little more time or an extra guitar part they could have made the opening sound much better. Then at the end of the song it would have been awesome for them to rip back into another chorus (and the first time you listen to the song you are so expecting them to), but they just fade out the song with this light surreal guitar fade. They do odd things like that a bunch of times on a variety of songs. Leaves you scratching your head... Don't get me wrong, it is a good album, a good band, and they have good songs. But they are so close to greatness so many times on this album and they just miss. It just makes me wonder why they decide to write some of the songs the way they did. Were the rushed to get it done? Sometimes it seems so.
