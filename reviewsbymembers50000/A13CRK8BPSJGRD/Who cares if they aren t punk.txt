 This album has some very catchy tunes.  NFG is in no way a punk bad. But do they have to be? As long as you like to listen to the songs who cares what they call it?  People who are punk purists won't like this band because of its radio friendliness and more popular sound. I thought that most of their songs were really good and I like all kinds of music in the genre. The first 5 songs are very solid. The best probaly being the first song on the album "Better Off Dead". They all have a common pop-punk formula of non-complex verses with a catchy chorus. Along with "Vegas" and "All about Her" you have 7 or 8 songs out of the 12 on the album that you will want to listen to over and over. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is two fold. One, there is no variety in the lyrics. All the songs are about girls and relationships. If you are not in the mood for that there isn't one song on the album you can listen to. Two, their vocals are so polished at times that on songs like "Eyesore" where the band "takes it down a notch" they sound outright N'SYNCish. I know, it scared me too... "Boy Crazy" seems like a Blink 182 rip off to me...not saying which one in particular....(off the Cheshire Cat album...wink wink)....songs like "Sucker" get lost in the chorus, and "Ballad For The Lost Romantics" for one, isn't a ballad, and two, would have been better if they didn't try to turn it into an anthem. However, the better songs more than make up for the 2 or 3 songs that don't work. It is well worth the price of admission. They are surprisingly good and I look forward to see what their next release sounds like. This isn't a "gotta have" album for everyone, but if you like Blink, FenixTX, Ataris, etc...you should pick it up. You will most definitely like it.
