 This album is one big train wreck. I really can't write a long review about it because there isn't much to say. The songs are watered down ska at its worst. It feels like they are just trying to throw something together to get money, not to make good songs. I didn't mind ska before, but this band is why ska gets such a bad rap. Stay away from this album. Save your money and buy something else....anything else...you will get more mileage out of a Yanni album.
