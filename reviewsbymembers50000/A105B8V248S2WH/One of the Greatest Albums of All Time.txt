 I have listened to a lot of music in my life - that's basically what I do. I first heard this album in an Econo Lodge in New Haven, CT surrounded by new friends and a bottle of whiskey. The joy in hearts when 313 came on is unique and will be with me forever - "Take my life if you are able, I don't want to be here when they come to take me in" sung with pop hooks and a jazz beat, brought tears to my eyes. The rest of the album is just as stunning. Sun Machine is a mastery of controlled power using rythm chords to a manifest pure joy and freedom. Even though this album won the Jammy album of the yeaar in 2000 it is still largely unheard and deserves more attention. The members of PH are pure muscians and people in touch with the rythm of the universe.
