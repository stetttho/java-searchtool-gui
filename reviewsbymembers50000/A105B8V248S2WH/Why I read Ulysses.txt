 As I read Ulysses, I asked myself, what is the point of putting all these words next to each other? When I got to the end, (and not until then) I realized that this book is Joyce's search for God amid everyday life in Dublin. This God(the father) is one who is caring, concerned, shows consideration, and is also a cuckold. One of the greatest moments of my reading career was the question and answer session at the end of part 2, and it is very much worth the journey through the streets of Dublin of June 16, 1904.
