 This book is not written by the senator. It is written by someone who knows what it means to be an orthodox Jew, and he tells the truth about the real political slant of someone who is a politician, and like any politician will adopt any slant to get elected. The author also discusses his personal life growing up in Brooklyn, and what it is like to really live as an orthodox Jew.
