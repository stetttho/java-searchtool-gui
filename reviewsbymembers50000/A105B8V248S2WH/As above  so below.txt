 Froget the hype. For anyone who has had a spiritual experience, the title song and rest of the album truly reflect a desire for a spiritual concsiouness in a material world. "Like a Prayer, I'll Take You There, It's like A Dream to Me."  What person in this world full of selfishness and ego, doesn't wish to go there, where prayers go. The beauty and truth in the song is the path of the singer. At first she says yes, than no, no more, "I have no choice," Than of course, I feel like dancing, where the seeker  and sought are one. The dance after a successful journey is truly a moment of joy, as beautifully expressed by the choir.   As for the name, Madonna's name is surely a connection to a heavenly entity. None less than the Buddha, before he adopted his life of ascetism, enjoyed every pleasure of the physical world, including sex(See Siddharrtha). He came to see their emptiness. While our songstress may not exactly rise to the greatness of her namesake, (or that of the Buddha), she surely has a spark of her soul. What we are witnessing is the journey of mankind form a low, mundane, physical conscious, to a place where the Light of the world will be revealed. (Ray of Light) We will see how for she goes with her spiritual desires, but based on her last three albums, she seems to be on the right track.
