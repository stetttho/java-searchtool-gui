 Ok. I admit it. I was a virgin. I was in Blockbuster and having never read or seen Hamlet I decided to be literary. And I was completely blown away!! It was one of the most enjoyable movie watching experiences of recent memory. I identified completely with Ethan Hawke as Hamlet, and the whole cast (except for Bill Murray).   This version of Hamlet is perfect for anyone who has been a college slacker since the 70's and has felt the psychological and philosophical dilemma's that that place in our society engenders. The twin joys of this version are 1) the transcendent beauty of Shakespeare's language; and 2) the univerisality of Hamlet's struggles, which transcends the generations. It may not be for Hamlet scholars, but this one was done for us, and if your one of us, you will enjoy it.
