 Every once in a while a work of art expresses the joy and heartache of the Divine Plan. This album is one those few times. The joy and heartache of love (Genesis, I'll Let You Know Before I leave) the spiritual journey (Song for the North Star), the promise of redemption (I'll be Allright, I am the Light of this World) and the fact that someone somewhere is suffering (or being punished)(Another Man Done Gone, Police Dog Blues)are all expressed. The poignanacy of the lyrics, and the truth of the heart and soul expressed through the mystery of music, create a potrait of the human condition that is relevant for all time.
