 I read the book in college, and then again last year. I just reread the introduction and recieved the answer I've been looking for the last 3 years. The blockage is the creation of the form. This of course is the idea of he imageless (read formless) creator. That's all you need epending on where you are. This is similar to the Ashlagian idea of 'Mati v'lo Mati' (to reach and not to reach) or as Trungpa says "not too tight, not too loose. To loose, we don't get anywhere (no desire) to tight, we create a form ( an idol). I know buddhists meditate in fornt of a form, but you should ask them about that!
