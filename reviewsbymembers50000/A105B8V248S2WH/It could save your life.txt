 This is a great album, but two songs in particular deserve special mention. 'Mission in the Rain' I have always loved, because as life teaches us "no matter  comes down (what happens) our mission always looks the same". This is an introspective album, with lyricist Hunter conteplating fame and fortune and realizing his "cup is empty; only love can fill." True words for any one on a journey. In fact that song, 'Comes a Time" has kept me going when all seemed lost. The album works for anyone.
