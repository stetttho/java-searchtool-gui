 Spritual ideas are simple - it's the practice that's difficult. This shows us the fun and the ideas and also gives us hint of what true spirituality can bring us - mind over matter and control over ones destiny. The book is useful for any level of the spiritual journeyman. It can be opened and referenced like the I Ching. It's a great and humble energy to have lying around.
