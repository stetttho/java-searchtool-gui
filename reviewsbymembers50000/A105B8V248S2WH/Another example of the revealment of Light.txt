 Again, in our world of physicality and cycnicsm, the Light chooses to reveal the possibilities within our our souls through a young adult book that has catured the imagination of the entire world. The question is not whether there are wizards and metaphysical possibilities within the human spirit, the question is when they will be revealed. The popularity of these is based on a human desire for fun, for joy, for an otherworldliness, and of course for the oppurtunity inherent in the goodness of man to do battle with evil. I hope all the people who read book realize that the possibilities of the human imagination are real, (as is the force of evil) and that the allure of Harry Potter and friends is tht each one of us wishs we were him (or at least like him).
