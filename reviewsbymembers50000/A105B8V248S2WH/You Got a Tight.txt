 The first song "Tight Connection..." is worth the price. The song is actually quite logical. It's about BD's lack of satisfaction with Christianity .."I never did learn to drink that blood and to call it wine..I never did learn to hold your love, and to call it mine." Pretty logical to me. While the rest of the album is admittly not so great, this is one of my favorite Dylan songs.
