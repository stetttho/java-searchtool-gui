 Every song rocks. Crystal clear clarity, probably the best sounding live album you'll hear. The songs: Paul Henry, the Harrower, The Honest Hour, Man With a Plan, are so tight and emotionally charged they will knock your socks off. A truly great album from a truly great band. Special mention to Nate Wilson's solo on Speculator - beyond.
