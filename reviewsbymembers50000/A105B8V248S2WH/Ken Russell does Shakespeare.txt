 Kenneth Branagh, in trying to set his Hamlet apart, creates a spectacle that belittles the drama of our favorite prince. From the inundation of flower petals to the mirrored court(and Branagh's dyed hair), this is over the top. While acting, or really just making speeches, Branagh never forgets he is a movie star, and doesn't become the character. It's a different take on Hamlet, without the emotional pain and with a lot of bile. The developement of the character does not really make sense. The portrayal of Gertrude(Julie Christie) is also problematic.         For it's good points, Derek Joacobi is excellent as Cladius, and the portayal of Hamlet's relationship with Ophelia and Polonius was revalatory. Also I very muched enjoyed the scene with the the first player(Charleton Heston) and the passages regarding Hecuba (which are left out of the Olivier version). For these two aspects this HAMLET is worth the price of admission.  For any Shakespeare lover this is a must see, but based on Branagh's portrayal, I only give it three stars.
