 As a Spanish teacher, I have used the English version of this book, _Froggy Gets Dressed_, with my own translations, as a story for the classroom and with a little neighbor. The tale always delights children and in the classroom, it serves as a meaningful and fun way to introduce or  review clothing words. (Once students have heard the story, watch them  wiggle in anticipation of the moment when Froggy's mother calls out a  particularly embarrassing oversight in Froggy's preparations to go play in  the snow!) A translation as good as this one is said to be can only enhance  the story's value and fun for children.
