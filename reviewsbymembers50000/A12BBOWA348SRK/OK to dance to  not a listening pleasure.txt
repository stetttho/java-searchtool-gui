 The first time I heard a bilingual/Spanglish remix of "Suavemente," I was dancing in a favorite club and was delighted by the novelty. After my boyfriend bought the Remixes CD, however, I found  that many of my favorite songs suffered in the translation. The charm of  "Suavemente," for example, is totally lost as the best lines of  the song disappear into a mix of lesser new lyrics and harsh-sounding  translations. Why translate the song if you're going to drop out a  wonderful line such as, "Dame un beso mas que en mi boca cabe"?  ("Give me one kiss more than my mouth can hold") [Pardon the lack  of accents!] If you want the CD as dance music for a noisy party, it may  provide novelty, but I can't recommend it for everyday listening.  (_Suavemente_, however, I recommend highly!)
