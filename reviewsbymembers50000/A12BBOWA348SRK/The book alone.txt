 If you take the book on its own (apart from any accompanying audiotape), you will find a cute text and fair translations from Spanish to English. As an introduction to some of the common rhymes and songs, the book serves  well and has attractive illustration. There are other books of this type  you might enjoy more, particularly if you wish to use the book in a  classroom setting.
