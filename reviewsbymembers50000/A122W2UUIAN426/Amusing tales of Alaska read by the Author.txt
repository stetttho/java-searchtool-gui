 Once more America's most distinctive humorist and storyteller invites us to spend a thoroughly entertaining visit with our friends at the End of the Road.  The townspeople at the End of the Road survived the Alaska oil spill, but life has a few more upheavals in store. Old Angus Winslow's begun to worry about the memory lapses he's been having since he banged his head. But that hasn't stopped him from declaring his interest, after 25 years in Ruby McClay. Ed Flannigan has a fateful encounter with a pipe wrench, and a stuck dump truck that will put him in an Anchorage hospital, and change his life. And Emmitt Frank, who came to Alaska looking for nature and himself, gets booted out of his town apartment and lands in a backwoods cabin to find both - for better or for worse.  From babysitting disasters, to the strangest set of wedding bells Alaska has ever seen, life takes some strange turns, and then again goes on pretty much as usual.  2 cassettes. Approximate running time is 2 hours, 10 minutes.  If you like Tom Bodett's stories and voice, this is very enjoyable.
