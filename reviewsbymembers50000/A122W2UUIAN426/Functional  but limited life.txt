 This unit lasted about one winter.  Too much heat was generated at the point where the male power plug (from the space heater) attached to the timer's female plug.  Reportedly, excess heat can be generated if the plug is not inserted fully.  But even when the plug is inserted fully and flush with the female plug, the male plug can work its way out gradually. In this case, the plastic case melts slowly and the unit stopped working -- which is better than having a fire.  Separatelly, I find the pins to be very inconvenient and easily misplaced.   I thought that Intermec used to make a superior model which had sliding tabs instead.  That said, for the price, I'll be buying another unit.
