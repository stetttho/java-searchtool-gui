 In all fairness, the copy I have was published in 2004, so much of the pricing and other info is outdated. Nevertheless, I was disappointed in the overly-opinionated editorializing instead of useful and insightful traveller's facts that I expect from Lonely Planet guides.  I think I will start giving a closer look to other travel pubs such as the Rough Guide series, which is a shame, as I have been a fan and loyal customer of LP since "SE Asia on a Shoestring" which was published the early 80s.  This Panama guide needs updating, more detail and a cleansing of the overly-political content.
