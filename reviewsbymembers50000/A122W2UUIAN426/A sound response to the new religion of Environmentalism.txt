 Environmentalism is one of our current society's new religions -- complete with extremist ideologues and evoking polarizing emotions similar to those arising from the abortion issue.  This text is a wonderfully-sound, logical exploration of energy from scientific and economic perspectives.  It reads like an engaging business text or extended magazine article, which is to say interesting, logical, and persuasive. The authors nicely puncture some of the Malthusian myths about energy which pass as current conventional wisdom.  No doubt this book is unpopular with the mainstream press, academe or Sierra Club-types -- much of what it lays out is heresy to the "big oil/industry/capitalism is bad" orthodoxy, but convincing nevertheless.  Facts are stubborn things!  A good read with lots of food for thought.
