 If you're reading these reviews, your experience will be different than mine -- I saw the DVD without any preconceptions (other than it was in my list of recommended films to see).  At first, I accepted the film's premise that it's a documentary about "Lichi," a mail-order bride from a poor 3rd world country (in this case, Burma) and Adrian, an overweight, lonely NYC doorman who orders her from a catalog.  Adrian initially appears to be a bit ignorant and unattractive, but an earnest, hard-working and decent guy.  However, after Lichi's arrival and quick marriage to him, events take a subtly dark and increasingly-abusive turn.  At several points, I wondered if some scenes, events and dialog weren't a bit staged -- would people really act out so openly in front of a camera crew?  More implausibilities kept cropping up, from minor details (i.e. why does Lichi -- a supposedly poorly-educated, destitute girl from rural Burma -- speak fluent Chinese in Chinatown?) to major plot issues (the build-up to a Jerry Springer-like finale).  Early on, I began to wonder how a theatre audience would react: women likely would howl over the overt exploitation, and human beings with a heart would recoil at the growing manipulation and opportunism, perversity, and heartache.  The film reeled me in and hooked me quite effectively: the unknown degree of truth kept me engrossed -- laughing, cringing, and wondering could this be at all true?  Net: As fiction, it's perversely entertaining.  As a film, it's controversial, and worth seeing.  Just not for kids or a first date.
