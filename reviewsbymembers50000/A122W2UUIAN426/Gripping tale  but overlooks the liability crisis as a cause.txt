 James B Stewart is a terrific author; this book reads like an extended Wall St Journal investigative article.  His painstakingly-detailed chronicle of Dr. Michael Swango - a true psychopath - is gripping and increasingly horrifying.  My only editorial comment is while Stewart rightly assails the medical profession for its failure to protect the public, Stewart might have explored a bit more the fear of legal LIABILITY as a root cause.  The book's focus on Doctors' hubris and hospitals' reflexive "circle the wagons" responses to allegations against one of their own gives short-shrift to the fact medical professionals are dedicated to curing diseases and saving lives.  Certainly, the ongoing malpractive liability crisis in this country leads the medical estiablishment into inefficient, unnecessary and - in this case - counter-productive and dangerous behavior.  Swango would never have gotten as far as he did without the ironic help of the legal system directly (defendants' rights over society's) and indirectly (threat of liability preventing doctors from admitting mistakes of judgment) shielding his criminal activity.  I would enjoy seeing Stewart take apart a lawyer/law firm in this way.
