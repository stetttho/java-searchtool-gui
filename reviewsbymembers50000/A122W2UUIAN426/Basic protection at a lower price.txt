 I wasn't that pleased with this case's fit on myPod 30.  I have found this case is a little too big for the 30 -- in addition to the included plastic spacer, it required inserting a thick slice of cardboard behind the iPod to fill up the slack.  The clear plastic window cover protects the iPod's screen, but is too easily scratched (Speck did send me a replacement, however).  No instructions or diagrams were included in the package I received. On the plus side, the soft ruobber cover provides effective shock protection from bounces and drops.  It's very basic protection at a lower price.
