 It's a well-told story of two young men's road trip through South America in the 1950s, and an eye-opening visual treat for an American like me who is ignorant of South America's geographic beauty and diversity.  Young Che (Ernesto), portrayed by the well-cast, eye candy (attractive) Gael Garcia Bernal: bonds with the common people ("I like your face" says one rural dweller approvingly), sacrifices for the poor, has empathy for the sick, heals the lepers, knows his own suffering and vulnerability, and strongly hints that he will dedicate his life to fighting the growing INJUSTICE they find.  In other words, young Che is presented as a very Christ-like figure.   But the final moments of the film give away a strong political bias -- Che was inexplicably murdered "BY THE CIA."   So we have this saintly, Christ-like man-child at the end of a transformative journey which takes him to the cusp of adulthood  -- but whose life was cut short by the US government agency equated with all the evil above.  The film would be beautiful if it was simply about 2 young men unknown to this day and age.   Because the story is obviously about a historical figure (a revolutionary leader who led armed rebellions involving lots of bloodshed) there are puzzling gaps -- how could such an vulnerable asthmatic become a jungle-based commando?  Why would he be assasinated?  The film's ending insinuates a lot of unstated political messages which detract from its value.  Ignore the obvious political bias, and enjoy it on the human and scenic level.
