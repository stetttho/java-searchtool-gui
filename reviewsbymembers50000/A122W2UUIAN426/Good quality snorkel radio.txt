 I have tried the Speedo swim radio, but found it difficult to hear because water would leak past the earplugs into my ear, effectively blocking the sound.  The Aqua Sphere transmits the sound via teeth and bone.  One must still wear a swim cap or ear plugs in order to cut down on the water sounds.  The Aqua Sphere is expensive, but provides a more effective way of radio listening.  Takes a bit of adjustment to swim with a snorkel (i.e. I had to get used to not letting in water through my nose when using eye goggles).  Signal strength must be strong (a local FM station works best).  Overall, I am pleased with the Aqua Sphere. Addendum: with the purchase of a small (25 milliwatt) FM transmitter (i.e. search Ramsey FM-25B), you can play books on tape or any audio recording and transmit it to your snorkel radio.   I listen to podcasts from my iPod while swimming.
