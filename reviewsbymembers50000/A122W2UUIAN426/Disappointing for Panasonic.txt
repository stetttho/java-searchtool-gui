 ...I own many Panasonic products (answering machines, portaphones, cellphone) and have been pleased with the consistently high quality, design and longetivity of their products.  However, I am disappointed with this product -- some minor annoyances like no tape/DVD counter/timer, complex 50+ button remote, BUT the darn thing doesn't accept all the VCR tapes -- it just rejects some (which play fine in other VCRs), not others.  DVD works fine; good quality.  EASY set-up; finished in less than 5 minutes.  Display is skimpy on info.
