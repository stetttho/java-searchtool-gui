 Watching Will Farrell try to throw off weak nebbish Woody Allen lines was painful to watch -- both stunk.  The film takes a twist on "Rashomon" -- presenting how different people might think a scenario plays out (tragic vs. comedic).  Were it not for Woody Allen's name, this film would drop into well-deserved oblivion.  Unless you're a die-hard Woody fan, this one is not worth your time.
