 I bought the JBL On Stage over a year ago for $110 (the current price should be lower) in order to have portable sound when travelling. Some pre-2006 units had a defective chip, but this one worked flawlessly out of the box. Never had a problem with it.  The sound is very good for the compact size -- surprisingly good bass response -- but still keep in mind that this is a portable speaker set, not a high-fidelity home stereo component. Surprisingly loud volume for such a small unit -- plenty to fill a hotel room. By now, adapters for all the iPods should be included -- for my unit, JBL mailed me free one for my 4G 30GB (request via their website).  The separate AC power supply is rather heavy and bulky (to supply enough power to drive loud volume), but still portable. I do not see the justification for buying the newer, more-costly On Stage II model unless you're desperate for a remote control.  PLUS: - good sound quality - small size, portable - easy to use, logical controls and functions - good ergonomics and styling - charges iPod MINUS: - HEAVY AC power supply (included). A 6 watt unit takes a lot of power to pump out so much volume, so it draws a lot of juice (no batteries, folks.)  NET: I like and highly recommend this unit. Shop around, pricing varies quite a bit.
