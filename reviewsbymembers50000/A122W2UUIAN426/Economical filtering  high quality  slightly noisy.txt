 In comparison to many air filters which use disposable (and expensive) HEPA filter units, this Friedrich uses an electrostatic filter element to collect and trap dust particles. This is far superior to the electrostatic filters sold by Sharper Image because the total surface area for collecting dust is MUCH greater.  The Friedrich C-90 (A or B) has an internal fan that draws air through a pre-filter, then through an aluminum element with many electrostatically-charged plates that capture dust particles, and finally through a carbon filter for cleaning up odors.  Filtration has 3 stages: 1)an outer filter to catch hair and large dust particles, etc. 2) the main inner filter element and 3) a final charcoal filter.  Each are removable to clean.  The main filter element can be cleaned in a dishwasher; the pre- and carbon filters can be cleaned with a vacuum cleaner brush.  I've never bothered replacing the carbon filter - but have no strong odors in the apartment.  I've never noticed any "ozone" smell noted by other reviewers.  NET: The unit is well-built, American-made, solid, but fairly large (like a small college-dorm refridgerator). The fan has 3 speeds.  I have no problem with the noise level, (a low hum from the internal fan even at the lowest setting) but it bothers my wife.  Prices vary widely; I've owned mine for 5+ years and would consider buying another/the same unit again.   ONE CAVEAT: the plates on the main electrostatic filter element are extremely fragile, and easily bent. Once bent out of alignment, the unit will continually pop and crackle as sparks jump between the unaligned plates.  A replacement filter element is costly, but not when one considers the first one lasted over 5 years.
