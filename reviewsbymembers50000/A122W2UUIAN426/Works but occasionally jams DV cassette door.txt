 The unit works as advertised, however, I've encountered an occasional significant problem -- occasionally in ejecting a mini-DV cassette, the cassette door mechanism jams, crunching the tape.  When inserting a tape, the outer cassette door cover opens to enable the camcorder heads to read the tape.  There is an inner door mechanism which slides to hold the tape in place when the cassette external door is closed.   Apparently, the inner door gets pushed off its track when being ejected from the Winder, which results in the inner door crunching the tape.  I figured out (with no help from Lenmar or JVC, the tape manufacturer) that the cassette inner door can be GENTLY pushed back onto its track with a pair of needle-nosed pliers,but it takes patience, keen eyesight, the right tools, and a new cassette to compare the mechanisms.  To Lenmar's defense, they offered to send me a new unit.  But I do remember some other reviewers saying their units crunched tapes.  So, if you're technically astute, go ahead -- but have a pair of needlenose pliers handy.  Or please recommend an alternate unit which doesn't have this problem!
