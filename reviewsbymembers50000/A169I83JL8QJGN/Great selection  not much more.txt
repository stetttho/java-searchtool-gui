 Sony promised us a revolution in games, they failed to deliver. The graphics on this system have been evolutionary, but far from revolutionary. Since it's launch in October of 2000 there have been very few noteworthy titles. In fact I rented a lot of games and have only found seven or eight noteworthy titles out of the whole lot, and while PS 2 is currently home to some great titles, like Onimusha Warlords, Metal Gear Solid, and Final Fantasy X I can feel Sony's steam fading and fading fast. Being that most of their major titles have supieror ports available on other consoles Sony has little to offer that is exclusive anymore. However, for the immediate future it is still home to Metal Gear and Soul Reaver, but Final Fantasy will also start appearing on the GameCube with in the next year. I do recomend buying this console, however, because while GCN is my primary gaming focus at the moment, the PS 2 is a good second, and also a decent DVD player, plus there are some noteworthy exclusives for the time being, where as XBox has Halo and Halo alone. Most Xbox ports of PS 2 games are only marginally better anyway. Buy this machine if you haven't already, get a GCN though too. Both systems are worth the money, but if you can only get one of the two systems, pass this one up for the GCN, PS 2 is far from a revolutionary system.
