  In all fairness the game was done on prerendered backgrounds, but even so I do have to applaud Capcom because even on my "so big it ruins everything" TV this game come off as very polished. I imagine that RE 4 for PS2 will be comparable to this, not a perfect replica of what can be done with the superior technology behind GameCube and Xbox, but pretty darn close. What I felt was the best part was the games near complete lack of jaggies. The anti aliasing was so well done that if this game had run in high resolution it would have blown everyone away. Now I realize that with prerendered sceneries that makes it easier to focus on character detail but still, even though this is an older game it came out quite nicely on my TV.  Game play mechanics still need work though. Capcom needs to ditch the tank like movement, especially for an action heavy title like this. In the last battle for instance, I wanted so badly to be able to strafe from side to side... but no... I could not. Regardless the controls are thankfully more responsive than most of the Resident Evil games ever were, so it still gets the job done. By and large game play is similar to the original, a lot of hacking and slashing with a few interesting but solvable without a guide book puzzles. Regardless it's still a lot of fun.  The story is not as strong as the original's but took me about two hours longer to get through, and features many different "paths" that can alter the story a number of different ways which does add some replay value.  Where this game succeeds most, however, is in making you eager to get your hands on the third installment... I was planning on playing a GCN title next but I might have to change that plan a bit, as now I'm eager to see what the 3rd of this so far amazing trilogy has to offer. Defiantly get this one.
