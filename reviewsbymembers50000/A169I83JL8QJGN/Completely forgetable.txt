 Having read some of the reviews by my fellow critics I know that I am about to get a ton of "not helpful" votes for what I am about to, what I have to say.  I have been a fan of Mariah since the beginning. I have every single, every album, every video and every DVD she has released. I love her voice, and I love and adore past efforts such as Music Box (my personal favorite Mariah Album) and Daydream, but since Butterfly something has been wrong with Mariah... Every album has pretty much been the same bland and boring type of stuff... I touted Butterfly as the last good Mariah CD, as I was not impressed with Rainbow, and I think we can all agree that Glitter was a joke, both as a movie, and an album.   Because I've been with Mariah for so long I went ahead and bought this CD despite my hesitation after Glitter... Sorry folks, what ever "it" is, she's lost it. This album offers nothing new or innovative, its as though Mariah has lost herself to a very bland repetitive and generic formula, and cannot move past it. This is very tragic for me because I love music, and I always expect new and innovative music from the legends. Michael and Janet Jackson let me down last year, this year its Mariah's turn to let me down. While I would welcome a Mariah Carey comeback with Open Arms (pun intended) I just don't see Charm bracelet in the same positive light as some do, and I'll honestly be surprised if this album is a huge success. She needs to break away from the rap guest stars, and generic light R&B badly, a new Mariah sound is needed or she will continue to stagnate and fester in the drowning pool of corporate manufactured garbage.
