 Getting a perfect guide book is rare, Brady games usually gets it right though. After the horrid guide to Final Fantasy IX, which was virtually useless as it would merely referr the reader to the Play Online Website for the solutions, I was really hesitant to buy this book. The game is pretty staright forward and I found myself referring to the book on very few occasions, which is abnormal for an FF game. I used this guide for the not so obvious secrets, but not a lot. The guide does not hold your hand in it's walkthrough, but thankfully doesn't leave you hanging either. However, some of the secrets could have been, and should have been incorperated into the main walk through, having to bounce between sections of the book was aggrivating, and I think that Brady should reevaluate their format and consider throwing the secrets into the main walkthrough. Also, some of the secrets were vague and unclear. I opened the secret path in the frozen forrest, but couldn't get to the crystal to charge the clouudy mirror because some blockhead was standing in the way. The book says nothing about how to get that person to move. Also the Cactuar ghost side quest, Some of the rocks you have to touch would glow, but would stop glowing as I approached, and when they stop glowing it won't do anything. The book offers no remedy for this dillema as well. I did beat the game, but with many of the side quests unfinished, and for the first time in my long history of Final Fantasy with none of the ultimate weapons. The guide was efficent, but could have been a little more elaborate without guiding me by the hand.
