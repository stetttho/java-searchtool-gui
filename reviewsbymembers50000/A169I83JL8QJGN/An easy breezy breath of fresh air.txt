 I've always wanted to get my hands on a Utada album, however, my devotion to respecting copyrights created a situation where my only option was importing, which is usually cost prohibitive for me. I have fallen for a number of Asian singers whose music is far more inspired, and innovative than any thing the pop industry has given us over the last several years. Burnt out on Brittany, still recovering from Back street Boys, and still angry that Michael Jackson failed to revitalize the pop industry with his last album I have been in a situation where I am far more reluctant to buy pop music than I have been in the past. I bought Cocoa Lee's CD when it came out only to be disappointed, and despite that I still had to take a chance on Utada. Boy am I glad I did.  Utada is probably the most daring artist I have heard in a very long time. She is not afraid to experiment, she's not afraid to express herself, and she'd extremely talented. I haven't heard anything this brilliant in a very long time, and frankly I hope that this CD does incredibly well as I am looking very forward to a sophomore domestic album, which I will happily buy the day of its release. Pop fans should not hesitate to pick this CD up. Only be warned, that while none of her music is blatantly offensive, some of the content may be too edgy for children.
