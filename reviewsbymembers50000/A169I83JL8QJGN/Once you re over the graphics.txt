 I like this game, which is a miracle because I did not like the last one, or the one before that, or the one before that. It is my opinion that Dead or alive is about nothing else but [exploitation]. This statement holds true of DOA 3, but for some strange reason it works for me this time. I noticed that the "bounce" that the series is well known for has been toned down significantly, and the movement of the characters is more realistic. I guess because the game itself has less of an emphasis on [exploitation] that I can take it more seriously as a fighter game, which is why I enjoyed this one, and plan to buy it later.   However some of its predecessor's weaknesses rear their ugly head. Once again the game attempts to tell an incoherent and irrelevant story that makes no sense. Temco needs to learn how to tell a cohesive narrative in the worst way. The fighting engine itself becomes tiresome, as many of the computer-operated characters can be beaten with the same simple combination kicks over and over again. The repetitive nature of the combat makes this fighter only good in a two-player match. Once you get over the graphics the game becomes quite shallow. Still fun, but shallow.
