 I was hesitant to see this movie, it took months of my little sister begging me to watch it, and frankly I'm glad I did. Although I disagree with her proclimation of "best movie ever" I cannot deny the artistic inginuity that this film is drowning in, in fact, this strength may also be it's greatest flaw. The movie is sometime awekwardly paced and the cinimatography, while brilliant is at times odd and almost as nautious as the Blair Witch Project. Despite over doing it in artistic appeal the film is beautifully colred, and coreographed. For the casual movie gower it may be easy to loose track of the story at times, but for movie buffs like myself the over all brilliance and depth of this movie makes it a definate must own. Although I must confess that if this movie had hoped to breathe new life into the dead musical genre it would have been better if they had used original music, not bizzar remakes of classic pop/rock tunes.
