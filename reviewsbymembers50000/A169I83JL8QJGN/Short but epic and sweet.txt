 If ever there was a series that could be labeled an epic it would be Legacy of Kain. Although Final Fantasy oft has that label even the Sakaguchi cash cow doesn't light a candle to the dark, gothic and twisted tale of Kain the knight turned vampire, and Raziel his disgruntled employee. As the story progresses we discover that everything we knew in Soul Reaver 1 was wrong, as I thought Kain does not appear to be the root of all evil, rather he seems to be trying to root out the real hands behind the demise of the sacred pillars. But he also seems to be up to more than that. His destiney had been robbed of him, he became a pawn in the eleborate game of Mobeous and his God (Who we now know is a giant squid.) Kain has set things into motion to undo the events of Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, or so it seems, and his key to rewritting history is Raziel, who is tired of everyone wanting Kain dead, and is now listening to reason. He cxontinues on his quest, no longer seeking to kill Kain, but rather to unravel the mysteries of the demise of the pillars, and the near extinction of the vampires. His quest adds more twists to the already deep plot of the story, but be warned, this story is far from over, it's clifhanger ending has left it very open for another sequel. Vampire fans must buy this game!
