 Spider-Man is perhaps one of the greatest super heroes of all time. In the traditional Marvel manner the character is deep a very good comedian too. Spidey's tounge-in-cheek humor is very well represented here, albiet by voice acting that is a little on the bland and dry side which has me worried becuase I hear that Toby McGuire (the actor playing him in the movie) provided the voice for the game. Although Bruce Campbell's narratives are great the voice overs for this game could have been a lot more energetic. I've always envisioned Spider-Man as a fast and energetic talker, and although Spidey's humor is more than present (the game is very funny) the lack of energy behind the dialogue is disapointing. The story for this game is a bit vague and choppy, but I supose that is because this game is beating the movie it's based on to the market and so they don't want to spoil the film, at least that's what I'm hoping for. If the movie is this choppy I'll be sorely dissapointed. Game play wise it plays a lot like the previous Spider-Man games, and it is probably one of the best beat-'em-ups in existance, but there are parts that are very very hard. Especially the time bomb chase down where if the bombs don't get you, the hunter robots will. Aside for that the game is very well paced, and will actually get your heart racing in some places. I have not played a game with such intense action in a very long time. Despite the dry voice acting (Please please, please do a better job in the movie Toby, I'm begging you!) and the lackluster story line the game is still very funny, and intense and a definate worthy addition to anyones game library.
