 Thank you Microsoft! You see? Companies can listen! XBox has been slowly improving since launch. Its games are getting much better, and the controllers have as well. I'm actually beginning to enjoy this machine. While the button placement is not as convenient as the PS 2 Dual Shock, or as comfortable as the GameCube controller, this controller is much less awkward than the original XBox controller. It could still be better, the black and white buttons are not in a place that make them easy to get to, but the other buttons are not as close together, and the button shape make them easier to know what button you're hitting, thus avoiding hitting the wrong button by accident, which happens to me a lot of the regular controller.  Aside from the placement of the black and white buttons one more complaint I have, I can get new Nintendo made GameCube controllers for much less than the Microsoft controllers are going for. If Microsoft could lower the price on these I'd buy three more.
