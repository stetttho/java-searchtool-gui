 Any real gamer knows that they can count on Nintendo to deliver some of the best games out there, and while the N64 was a little lacking in quantity of titles it was still home to some of the best games ever made. The N64 failed to capture the support of third party developers because of it's difficult to develop for cartridge format, but those days are gone. GCN is actually the most powerful of the three consoles. Nintendo is out to prove once and for all that it's not your system's stats that count, but the over all performance, and architecture of the system, and so far GCN has put out several titles that have been graphically light years ahead of the competition. Although Xbox has the potential to be more powerful, we have yet to see that. While GCN continues to have graphical marvels such as Rogue Leader and Resident Evil Rebirth, PS 2 and Xbox continue to be plagued with mediocre graphics that look outdated compared to GCN, especially Resident Evil: Rebirth. GCN is horribly underrated by a mainstream press that has bought into (or were bought by) the Sony and Microsoft hype machine. There is the idea that Nintendo's target demograph is strictly 12 years old, but this is about as far from the truth as you can get. Even Square is coming back, and this has been officially confirmed, it is no longer just a rumor. With Silicon Knights, Capcom, Square, Rare, Namco and many other high quality developers backing Nintendo calling the system a kiddie toy will surely get a groan from the 20-25 year old demograph (my age group) that is actually buying these machines and loving them. Prematurely dismissing GCN as a kid's toy will cause you to miss out on what will inevitably be the best line up of games since the SNES. Especially mature titles, as all Nintendo is lacking there is currently Legacy of Kain, and rumor has it that a port or sequel for that is under way as well.
