 When I heard that there would be an Obi-Wan game built in the vein of Jedi Knights I was so happy I bought an XBox. Well, I'm hitting myself pretty hard right now. While I will admit that XBox has had a very small handful of noteworthy titles my PS2 and GameCube have been giving me a lot more pleasure and good games to choose from. Obi-Wan stands as a testament to the type of over hyped garbage that the XBox has been pushing down a perhaps gullible consumer markets throat for almost a year now. To think that I bought the system for this game... Let me attack every aspect of it that is wrong.  The graphics are Playstation 1 quality at best, granted running in high resolution, but the character models, frame rate and animation are all terrible. The control feels clumsy, the story is boring, and as an Obi-Wan fan I was more put off by the way they portrayed Obi-Wan than enthusiastic about it.   The voice acting was terrible. The voice actors sounded nothing like their movie counterparts, and Obi-Wan came off as being very smug, and unlikable simply because of his voice alone. The sad part of this game is how great the game could have been if A) the graphics were more in touch with what the XBox CAN do, which is a lot more than this, B) the story and dialogue were a lot better, and C) the controls were not so clumsy and were a bit more precise. It is amazing to me that this game made it to the market like this. It was the reason I bought an XBox, it is a good thing I'm broke and could only afford to rent the game. Consumer beware! Rent this game before buying it!
