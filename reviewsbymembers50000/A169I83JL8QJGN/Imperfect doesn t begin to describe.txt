 Two words... Deep Hurting. When I read the harsh reviews that the critics were giving this game I took a look at the graphics, and I saw some of my favorite Marvel characters and I said "wow, it can't be that bad." So I, like an idiot, bought it. I am going to make a bold proclamation here. This has got to be the WORST game I have played this generation, the absolute worst! A huge waste of my $50 investment and I'll tell you why.  The single player story mode has to be played through in order to get anything unlocked in the main game. The story mode defines suffering. The quests are repetitive and obnoxious, and the block/dodge button is completely unresponsive... in fact the whole combat system is bloody unresponsive! This game has so many annoying quirks it makes me wonder how EA (normally a company known for at least moderate quality) could have allowed this catastrophe to be unleashed upon unsuspecting Marvel fans.  People, if it's Marvel you want pick up Marvel Vs Capcom 2 it remains the best Marvel fight to date. Marvel Nemesis is worse than the X-Men Mutant Academy/Next Dimension series; it's an absolute abomination despite its excellent story and amazingly detailed characters. Its game play is simply put unplayable. I have not had a game get me this angry in like... ever. It would behoove EA to have at least put a difficulty setting option for the story mode, as getting through the story mode features no gradual increase in difficulty as you become acquainted with the new characters, it simply goes from ridiculously easy with the Thing to absolutely impossible with Daredevil. Unless you enjoy masochism DO NOT rent, and DO NOT buy this piece of garbage. I'm trading mine in tomorrow toward something else. I hope I never hear the words Marvel Nemesis again. It's absolutely horrible! This blight on Marvel's otherwise excellence should be removed from shelves and burnt.
