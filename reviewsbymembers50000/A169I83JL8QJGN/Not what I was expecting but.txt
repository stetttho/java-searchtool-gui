 I was expecting quite a bit more from this film, perhaps because I've been with the game series since it's earliest incarnations here in the US. I've seen these themes before, yes, generic, maybe, a bad movie? Not really. Look, this movie could have been a lot better. We all know it. We all have our complaints. My biggest complaint was that someone other the Uematsu composed the score for this movie. Uematsu, of course, has done the music for all ten games thus far. I rather enjoyed the story, although I could see 'inspiration' from Aliens and Starship Troopers, the dialougue fit the film, though when Aki would cry and no tears came out of her eyes I found that disturbing. The facial expressions were all dead on, but no tears? Did anyone else find this puzzling? The movie was too short and had an ending that you have to be very into anime to understand or be able to cope with. Over all the movie was enjoyable for anime fans like myself, but those who do not follow Final Fantasy as a game series, or Japanese animation may be baffled by the movie's plot, or may find the movie's story sterile and unenjoyable.  More that it's plot the visual presentation has got to win some technical awards at the Academy Awards (Oscars) this year, since this is singlehandedly the most visually impressive film since The Phantom Menace, the images were so close! Imagine what it will be like when video games look this good!
