 Kain has opted not to sacrifice himself, and there are forces out there that would have you believe that this once noble knight was now a selfish and aarogant tyrant, and while this seems true if there's one thing we learned from Blood Omen, things are not as they appear.  1000 or more years after Blood Omen Kain has been exaulted to the status of a god. He has raised up an army of vampires lead by his first "born" Lt. Raziel and lashed out at the humanity that had attempted to erradicate the vampires under the leadership of Mobieus. Every so often a vampire enters a state of change and evolves. Raziel sprouted bat like wings, and in what seemed like a jealous rage Kain tore the wings from his back and ordered Raziel to be executed. But that is only beginning. Centuries later, Raziel awakens, battered, torn, and not even a shadow of his former glory. A mysterious entity calls to him and orders him to exact his revenge on Kain. The story is pretty straight forward compared to Blood Omen, and Soul Reavor 2, it's still a story of epic proportions but not as good as it's prequel and sequel. Still it's integral to the over all story. If you haven't played it yet shame on you, but get the Dreamcast or PC version.
