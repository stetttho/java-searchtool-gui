 I don't have much that I can say about this game that is good. The story line didn't make this game worth while, and while the gameplay was better than FF VIII the character models were iritatingly childish. This is what we get from the systems that accuses Nintendo of being nothing but kiddie games? You can't have cutsie cartoony characters swear and pass it off as not being kiddie crap, and I'm sorry, but that's what this game was. It wasn't even an epic kiddie game like Mario, or Pokemon, what this was wasa mediocre last ditch attempt to try and sqeeze some much needed cash out of the franchise, and while it wasn't entirely unlikeable, it was such a throwback to older games that it was completely unoriginal, and there in lied it's problem. It's plot, characters, etc were all rehash from past FF games. There are moments of silliness that will force a smile out of you, but I found myself anxious to have the game overwith, and never bothered to dig into side quests, bonus Eidilons or any of that. Had FF IX been FF VIII maybe I would have liked it better, but to spoil me with FF VIII's graphics, then expect me to be happy with the super deformed kiddie garbage is unfair. Thankfully FF X takes the series back into a progressive state, unlike this one which was more rehash than nostalgia.
