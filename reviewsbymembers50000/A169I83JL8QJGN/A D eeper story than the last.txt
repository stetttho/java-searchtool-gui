 Its interesting to me that although the movie's title character is D the movie doesn't spend as much time with him as it does with the Markis Bros and Leelu (not sure I spelled that right). But what time we do get with D and Left hand, his parasitic side kick, is quality time indeed. Unlike the last movie (made sometime in the 80s) we actually get some true insight into the character, and a little of his origins are finally revealed as well. We also get emotionally attached to the character and grow to understand why he is so distant, he doesn't age, and he knows that because of what he is he will always be alone. Lonliness seemed to be a theme that ran deep in this story. This is simply the best anime that I have seen in a long time. The lip synch is perhaps the most accurate, but this was done with the American audience in mind, and the level of detail the characters featured was simply amazing. This movie's artistry has yet to be outdone, and noone has ever done such detailed anime before that I am aware of. Additionally the animation in and of itself lacked the traditional japanese low framerate and jerky animation, the animation was smooth and fluid.  Sadly the extra features section of this disk biffed it badly. The making of featurett is boring, and the sound during this feature takes a nose dive in several places. The side by side storyboard-final film comparisions are always nice, but for me making of featurettes are what can make or break the DVD extras, and the making of featurette was horrid. Once again, like the first, this one is worth buying for the film alone, as it is truely a beautiful movie that stays very true to the lost Dhampir (Dunpeal) mythology. If Blade were only half this good...
