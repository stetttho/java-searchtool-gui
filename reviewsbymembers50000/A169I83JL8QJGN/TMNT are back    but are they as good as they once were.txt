 Someone once told me that fashion and trends tend to repeat themselves every 20 years or so. He-Man is back, Pretty Pretty Princes is back, Rainbow Bright has returned, as has Care Bears (which has my wife very happy), and Strawberry Shortcake... and so too have the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles returned with an updated look and style designated for a modern audience.   I remember watching the old cartoons as a kid, and playing the old Konami Ninja Turtle games in the arcade, and on my NES or Super NES and loving them. Then the fad fizzled out. I lost interest when I discovered X-Men, a story I've been following since I abandoned the Ninja turtles.   Having beaten all my GBA titles thus far my wife and I went searching for an inexpensive new addition to keep me occupied during slow time at work. That was Saturday... today I am rearranging my budget to look for a new game to keep me busy at work during down time.  Its not that this game is bad, far from it, its just ridiculously short. This game takes about three hours to clear completely, with next to nothing to extend the game play or encourage replay. Worse yet there's no two-player modes at all, and as far as I can tell no unlockable secrets. Also the stories seem to be based on episodes from the new series, which could explain why there seems to be such a minimally connected narrative between the games "chapters". Played even remotely out of order and it will make the story completely incoherent. (I recommend playing Leo, Raph, Mike, and then Don for the most coherent story). This game is a lot of fun, but there simply isn't enough of it. It was fun to relive a piece of my childhood, but overall I wish I had gotten Metroid Zero Mission instead, even if it did cost a bit more.
