 Since season five of the X-Files I've been largely disinterested in TV watching. I have a huge collection of movies, all on DVD, and that's what I liked to watch until one day I didn't feel like watching a movie and decided to tune in to Fox just for kicks. It was then that I incidentally stumbled upon the premier of season 2 for 24, and I've been hooked ever since, so much so that I did not hesitate to buy the first season... I got so hooked that I took time off from work just to watch this box set, something my boss was teasing me about for days after the fact.   I cannot discuss the plot for this show, because I don't want to spoil any of this amazing piece for anyone who might be interested, all I want to say is that this box set is well worth the price, as it is significantly less than the average price of an X-Files box set, yet it contains only one less disk, while at the same time containing 24 episodes, each one being an hour long, each hour being an hour of the day, starting at midnight, and ending at midnight the next day. It's intense, gut wrenching, and addicting. I have already made a commitment to buy every new season on DVD as they become available. I especially recommend this box set by those like me who didn't know about the show until Season 2. Get caught up to speed and buy this box set!
