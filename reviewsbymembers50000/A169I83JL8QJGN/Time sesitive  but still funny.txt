 The final installment, and probably the "worst" of the Naked Gun trilogy. This is not a bad film by any means; it's just not as good as its predecessors. The problem with this movie is that of the three it has the most time sensitive gags. Most notably when they go to the Oscars in LA, and the city behind them is on fire. The LA Riots are not a common discussion nearly a decade after the fact, in fact it seems like an event that is all but forgotten. I already had to explain this gag to a 19 year old friend of mine who didn't like the movie because of having to have so many of the time sensitive jokes explained to her. Because of this I must issue the critique that having more special features dedicated to the history surrounding the gags would have been nice. Comedy that pokes fu of something you know about is so much funnier than the comedy that you know nothing about. Never the less, if you are familiar with the history and the culture of that era (essentially if you're my age or older, or only a few years younger) you'll love this movie. But for some younger viewers it may not be something you'll get.
