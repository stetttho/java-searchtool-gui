 With graphics that are comparable to James Bond: Agent Under Fire, with slightly better textures, and cheesy, often childish sound effects its a wonder this game is a popular as it is. I am not a fan of first person shooters, and here is why... Control. This game needs to be on a PC. It has a very mouse and keyboard feel to its control set up, a set up that does not work well with a control paddle. Still, despite these quips Halo manages to be a very good story with a lot of possibilities. I have not finished the game, but despite my complaints I will probably have to at some point buy it. Maybe when the price goes down. For future installments it is my hope that Microsoft will remember that the XBox is a console, not a PC, and will develop more console user-friendly controls in the vein of Goldeneye in the future. They may also want to consider not having than baddies laughing maniacally as you're blasting them into tiny pieces. I will probably buy the PC version so I can use the mouse and keyboard. It will feel less awkward to me.
