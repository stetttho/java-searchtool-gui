 There are some episodes of MST3K that no B-Movie fan should be without, Eegah is one of those. While simply too horrible to view on its own, the film becomes hilarious when you add the crew of Mystery Science Theater to it. Classic tag lines like "Watch out for snakes" find their origins in this low life movie, which has "Richard Keil... and not much else."   Mystery Science Theater is not for everyone, however, as the style of humor is very reliant on references to other movies, and there are references that even I, a self-professed movie buff, do not understand. Some episodes of Mystery Science Theater (albeit rarely) can even be a little boring. But Eagah is among the funniest moments in the series' history, and while the best ones like "Santa Clause Versus The Martians" are still not available on DVD I would recommend Eegah as a must have for any MST3K fan's collection.
