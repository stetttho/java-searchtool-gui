 Insurrection is a fun little film, little being it's problem. It's simply too short, and doesn't have an intriging story line at all. Although lighthearted and full of moments that are comedica and silly (largely thanks to Data) it just doesn't live up to what I expect from Star Trek. I do like this movie, but it's just no where near as good as other Str Trek films. Like most trek films of the past the odd number curse applies to this film. It's fun, but it's just not necissarily purchase material, though my copy of Insurrection is one of the first DVDs I bought, so it does have some sentimental value.... collecting dust.
