 Jean Jacque Annund has a rare gift, he seems to be able to almost communicate to the animals he films exactly what he wants them to do, and the animals do it. Not only do they do it, but also they do it well. The bear is Annund's animal adventure prior to Two Brothers, and it's an even more daring endeavor than the enduring and tragic tale of Kumal and Sangah. The reason its so daring is because there is less than ten minutes of human dialogue in the entire film. Despite the lack of human dialogue there's still a lot about this film that makes it enjoyable, watching animals do what they do, and communicate with each other and others in their environment. While some parents may express concern over the "violence" of this film I must stress that the movie isn't as violent as it is sadly realistic. The sad thing that parents need to realize is that people DO this sort of thing to the animals, and it needs to stop. That's the whole point of this film. We have our place in the world, and we need to stop encroaching on theirs. It's a message as necessary to children as the message of Schindler's List. They need to see this while they still have a heart to care. The Bear was the film that got me into Animal Welfare Activism. And even now I am a proud supporter of the World Wildlife Federation and the Save the Tiger Fund with what time and money I can give. We need more activists, more people that care. And the best way to do it is to let the kids see this film and be exposed to the reality of human ignorance, and cruelty, and the mindless slaughter of innocent animals for petty sport. Aside from that this film shines on many artistic levels. It's a true classic for animal lovers, and I love it. This film does for animals what Star Wars did for special effects. It's truly a gem as rare as the animal itself.
