 In making the last few Castlevanias more like Symphony of the Night (arguably the best game in the series) Konami had hoped to repeat the magic that made the Playstation installment so great. Something had been missing, despite Circle of the Moon and Harmony of Dissonance being great they just weren't as great as Symphony of the Night. I've come to the conclusion that I like swords better than whips. In Aria of Sorrow you play as Soma, a young man summoned inside of a solar eclipse where Dracula's Castle is being kept. He finds that he has the ability to absorb souls, but he doesn't understand why he has this power, all he knows is that he wants to find a way to escape the castle. It's the first Castlevania to take place in the future, rather than the past, and nearly sates my insatiable thirst for a modern times Castlevania. Aria of Sorrow plays much more like Symphony of the Night as the main character uses swords rather than a whip, which is nice. I never thought that killing monsters with a whip was possible anyway.   The story could use a little work, as with all Castlevania there's only enough to keep you playing, not much more, but what's there is interesting. This game has spectacular graphics, looking pretty close to Metroid Fusion in quality.   In all honesty though the music is still lacking. While better than Harmony of dissonance its not quite on par with Symphony of the Night or even Circle of the moon. Most of the tunes are forgettable, which is sad because Castlevania has always been, in part, about the music. The good news is that the music isn't unbearable like HOD was. Konami once again has found a way to keep the general style of Castlevania going without letting it get stale or boring. I can't wait for the next one! Especially since I can finally sell those excess weapons I don't use in the shop!
