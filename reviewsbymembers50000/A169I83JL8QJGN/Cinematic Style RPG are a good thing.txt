 Square began to experement with cinema style RPGs with Parasite Eve, based upon the book of the same name. As far as I am aware it seems that this game is a sequel of sorts to that novel, and alothough I do not believe the novel has been translated to English there is a movie based upon it that has been released state side by ADV films. The film is subtitled and not very good but does help to add more depth to the "universe" of Parasite Eve.   I won't write much about the story, it is sufficent to say that the story is the driving force of this game which is a lot of fun, but like with other "experimental games" not without its flaws.   The first flaw that this game has is that is controls seem a bit un responsive, and Aya moves very stifly. This game could have benifited from the motion capture techneques that were later used on Final Fantasy VIII. The next flaw is that the random encounters simmer down and eventually stop. You can "wip out" all enimes in a particular area making it hard to level up to riduculous levels of speed an power. Random encounters are a pain as it is, but if you're going to have them let me have enough of them to get up to level 99 and wipe the floor with the end guy.   However the weapon mods are interesting, the overall gamplay is very innovative and over all this game was great. It is just a shame it was so short and impossible to make Aya an all powerful unstopable juggarnaut like you can with other RPGs.
