 Metal Gear the card game. What idiot thought this up? Card based video games (like the Urban themed games) are really getting on my nerves. They're often times slow paced, and obnoxious in that you never seem to have the card for the action that you want. The game even requires you to use cards to move! Every action, and reaction are restricted by a card system that is too complex, and too difficult to get a grip on. Worse yet by the time you've figured out how to play it you're squaring off against the game's requisite Metal Gear.  On the plus side the game's graphics are pretty good, and the story is superb, albeit a little convoluted. Regardless it's the well written story that will probably force you to complete the game.   The down side is that the story is presented in text and hand drawn stills as opposed to the fully voiced cinematic (yet real time) cut scenes that Metal Gear is known for. There is no reason aside from developer laziness that the presentation had to suffer like this. In fact, it is this presentation which makes the story somewhat convoluted, as it is at times, difficult to tell what's happening.   The music is also pretty disappointing for this "all powerful" handheld (PSP). If MGA is your primary reason for buying the PSP, let me forewarn you, you're probably better off looking for story spoilers on the web. This game has so many annoying game play problems it's barely worth it to play at all. If this had been a real Metal Gear game rather than a cheap card based knock off it could have been something special.
