 We all know I adore Mandy Moore. She's a fantastic singer, and a great actress. Few in this world can do one or the other, even fewer can do both.   The problem Mandy's past CDs have had is that they are mostly songs written by other people and are a bit generic, if not completely disposable, with a couple of notable exceptions, mostly music that would be more suited for children. Mandy's newest CD, on the other hand is a lot more mature, not in a Brittany Spears exposing too much sort of way, but in a poetic, meaningful music sort of way. While only one of the songs on this CD was actually written by Mandy the songs of this CD seem to have been written a lot more carefully to appeal to those in their late teens or early twenties. I was particularly fond of Yoyo. As simple as the song may seem, I've been in relationships like that and so I can relate to the song, even though I'm a guy, and what have you.   Ultimately the best music is music that speaks to someone on an individual level, and I think that this CD has several tracks that accomplish that a lot better than past albums. The best song on this CD is the last track, a song Mandy co-wrote herself. I hope that future CDs by Mandy will feature more songs written by her as well.   This CD is the best of the Mandy Moore collection. The songs are a lot of fun, and not as disposable as previous albums. I will not hesitate to recommend this album to just about any music fan.
