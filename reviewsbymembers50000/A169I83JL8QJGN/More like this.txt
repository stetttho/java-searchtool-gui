 It is rare that a game looks this good on the realitively weak PS2. (Sorry but if you compare the real world performance stats GameCube and XBox are lightyears ahead of Sony.) Even Hideo Kojima complained about the difficulty in developing the game, but he still managed to put out a game that looks and feels like a major Hollywood blockbuster. A deep engrosing story involving Solid Snake and later his replacement Raiden in a quest on a mission to stop terrorists from gaining access to the new and invincible Arsenal Gear. But there's so much more to it. The story features a grand conspiracy involving the real rulers of the United States, the threat of nuclear war, and many other themes. Over all both the game and the story are phenominal. But even though I am giving this game five stars I do have a few minor complaints. Raiden grows on you, but I wanted to be playing as Snake. In the future Konami might want to remember that Snake is the reason we love Metal Gear, and while I hope we haven't seen the last of Raiden, I don't want the game to focus on him as much as this one did, I don't want to loose track of him either. Snake still needs to be the focus. Also there are some contentinuity issues that must be explained, watch the Colonel closely, and Rose. You'll see what I mean. It raises the "if this is true then how/why did he... at Shadow Moses.. when..." question for those who are utterly engrossed in the story. And hang around after the credits, they provided quite the twist ending. It'll be interesting to see what the third Metal Gear Solid will be like, but hopefully Konami will opt to put it on a system that will allow them to accomplish the graphical marvel that PS2 didn't allow them to do due to it's bottlenecks.
