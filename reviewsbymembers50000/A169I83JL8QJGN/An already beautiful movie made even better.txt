 I never bought the theatrical DVD because I was made aware of this version well in advance. 30 minutes worth of additional footage... hmm..   My review remains largely unchanged. I still feel that this movie over all is the most beautiful film ever made, and I'm eager for the sequel. The additional footage adds a lot to the story, however, making this version the definitive version of the film. The additional features are a nice touch as well. I loved the "a day in the life of a Hobbit" featurette.   The only complaint I have is that all our of these disks are single layer, they could have had a dual layer two disk set, eliminating the need to change disks half way into the movie, which in my mind is annoying, considering today's technology. Despite this minor complaint I still will take this extended edition over the theatrical release any day. I only hope that the Two Towers will contain all the footage they intend to use so I can buy that DVD right off the bat rather than having to wait for its extended edition.
