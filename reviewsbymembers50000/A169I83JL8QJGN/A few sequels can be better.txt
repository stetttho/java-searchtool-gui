 This movie is far less era sensitive than its predecessor, and just about anyone should be able to understand the humor behind the Smell of Fear. There is quite a lot of genius to this particular comedy, and the jokes just do not get old. Of the trilogy this film is the best. The title alone is worth a thousand laughs. If you only buy one Naked Gun movie, make this installment that movie. I think that if modern comedies were more like this than we'd have a lot more genuine laughs.
