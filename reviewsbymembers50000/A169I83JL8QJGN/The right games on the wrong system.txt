 FMV sequences don't do much for me any more, and as impressive as they can be sometimes having FMVs just does not warrant a port of a remake of the classic Final Fantasy on the Playstation (or PS2 in my case) when it is obvious that even using enhanced graphics the game still does not fully utilize the PS1's sprite power. The games are still great, especially for nostalgia, but they would have been better off being brought to GameBoy Advance. The enhancements made to FF 1, and the never domestically released FF 2 were appreciated, but not drastic enough considering the types of enhancements that could have been made, but were not. Animation is still stiff, the music is improved but still not to the level of FF VIII, or X, and at this point if they are going to keep doing remakes of older FF titles they need to either fully realize the game's potential for the system the game is being made for (PS2, I mean does anybody still have or even use a PS 1 anymore?) or bring it to a system where less is expected of the game, GameBoy Advance is screaming for a game like this. Not that I don't appreciate that Square has been so dedicated to getting us updated versions of their classic games, its just that I'd like to see some 32-bit looking remakes out of them for PS1 or some 128 bit remakes for PS2, rather than low end 16-bit looking RPGs with a couple FMVs thrown in to justify the decision to put it on the Playstation.  And in all honesty I'd much rather see updated versions of FF VII, VIII, and IX on Xbox or GameCube at this point, or even PS 2 as long as it is able to fully realize the game's artistic potential. Love the games as I do, FF 1 and 2 are simply not upgraded enough to warrant their appearance on the Playstation. GameBoy Advance would have been a much better platform for these games.
