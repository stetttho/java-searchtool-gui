 This is actually something that was bought for me by a friend who wanted to hook me up to his LAN games. I have since learned that his whole reason for it was to play Mongolians to my Great Wall of China. How come every time I put up a good barricade his troops have to go and knock it down?   I find myself frustratingly hooked to this game right now, desperate to beat his troops into submission. So far, I have had no luck. I suck at this game.   During single player mode I find that this game has amazing pretender FMV sequences that are comparable to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, but the real time graphics are far from impressive, adequate, but not impressive. There is a great deal of stuff going on in this game though, and that's what makes this fun. It's the strategy. Trying to build your defense, and offense evenly, do I train a bunch of troopers, or hold out and train bigger, badder monsters? What are my opponents doing? Will they notice if I send a peasant to steal gold out of their mines? If I conquer their mine, will they retaliate? I can't pull myself away! Help! I can't turn this game off!   The only real problem with this game is that I have to upgrade my computer in order for it to run properly. Right now I have some serious lag issues, and the larger my army, and better my defenses the slower the game runs. I'm more of a console gamer, but this game may finally force me to upgrade the motherboard.
