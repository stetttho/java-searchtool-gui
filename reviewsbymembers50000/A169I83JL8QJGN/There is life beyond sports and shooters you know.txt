 Okay, I admit that I wanted my gamer's tag the day this thing came out, but I didn't have the money then. Two months later I'm too late...someone else snagged it... oh well. Ultimately I got this because my GameCube had gotten me excited about online gaming, surprising huh? Amazing what a solid Massive Multiplayer Online RPG like Phantasy Star Online will do for you... Amazing how XBox live does not have, and will not have a MMORPG anytime soon. If I had known that, and I should have, but wasn't thinking about anything except getting my Gamer's Tag, I probably would have held off on this purchase.  I'm pumped about XBox live. Between the three consoles XBox definitely has the best online plan, but the problem with it so far is that the games are all sport and shooter titles. I had hoped for a MMORPG, and while there is one that I am aware of in the works, it won't be out until toward the end of the year... meaning I just bought a year subscription to an online plan that I probably will not be using much this year at all.  This also means that my review of this product is subject to change... Microsoft has had a problem with variety all along. XBox almost seems like nothing but sport titles and Sci-Fi based shooters. This lack of variety shows in my ever so slowly building of my XBox collection, where as GameCube is up to 14 titles, PS 2 still dwindles at 8, and XBox at 4, with this peripheral being purchased with the intention of building that collection. Thankfully Capcom will be releasing Capcom VS SNK 2 to XBox with Xbox Live support sometime next month... but aside from that there are simply no other games for XBox live that I'm interested in right now, so needless to say I'm disappointed, but I'm sure that True Fantasy Online will make me change my review for this product, but again that's not until toward the end of the year.
