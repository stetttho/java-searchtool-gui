 Real time cut scennes, something that was practically unheard of in the day of Metal Gear Solid, and while the lips annoyingly refused to move the camera work was epic, sweeping, dynamic, and everything an action flick should be. Metal Gear Solid was indeed a revolutionary title and the first video game that I played with grade AAA voice acting. (Of course I hadn't played Legacy of Kain at that point.) The directing in this game is its biggest accomplishment. Hideo Kojima needs to do movies. If movies these days could be even half this good I'd be less likely to complain so much. This is another add to my "I wish they'd remake it for GCN."
