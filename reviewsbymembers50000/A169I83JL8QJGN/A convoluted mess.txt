 Silent Hill is supposed to be a mystery. There are some questions that cannot be answered... yet at the same time none of the games have featured stories that were next to impossible for me to follow. This comic was guilty of that crime, as it bounces around way too much, and the artwork is perhaps too sloppy and muddy to make it clear what is going on. By the time I finished reading this comic I had a whopper of a headache trying to follow this story.  I hope the other Silent Hill comics fared better. I'm more tempted to blame the art work than the writing on this one because if the art work had been clear enough to convey the story I might have been able to follow it better.   I was disappointed when I learned that the Metal Gear Solid features similar art in their comics, and simply I plan to avoid it too, I simply cannot interpret the story from this slop.
