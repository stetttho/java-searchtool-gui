 I must stress that my score of 4 stars is based on the netire DVD package, not just the movie itself.  Labyrinth is a great film, and the movie that my family watches anually at Holloween since I got the DVD. The acting in the movie is a little cheesy in parts, mostly Jennifer Connely, however David Bowie was compelling in his role the Goblin king... the tights are a bit unsightly though. This movie is an essential must own for Jim Henson fans. It is also the first Lucas film to hit DVD. As the first I suppose one must go easy on the over all DVD, but I've come to expect more out of Mr. Lucas when it comes to "special editions." The transfer is not much better than the VHS version, although the colors are more vibrant and richer, and the widescreen presentation is also a nice touch, it was still a little grainey, and there were parts where it was overly obvious a blue screen and optical print was used, all things which could have easily been corrected at very little cost. The special features are nice, and informative, but not substantial. It would have been nice if this package had been as fully loaded as the Dark Crystal. Still it does have above average special features. And it's definately worth buying, it just could have been better.
