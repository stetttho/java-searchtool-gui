 I like B-movies. I hunt them down, I MST3K them, and from that standpoint Blade 2 was pretty good. There's little plot, some sharp and funny dialogue, and some more of the hack fest that the first one offered. All in all the film is very enjoyable, and good for a laugh. The problem is that I'm not so sure that was the intent of the film.   Blade is still a shallow and two-dimensional character, and bringing Whistler back when I was under the impression that he shot himself in the head with a silver bullet in the first one seemed kind of gimmicky, and cheap in the vain of the Search for Spock. I hate it when they bring dead people back to life in sequels. Never the less a lot of the better moments of this film were courtesy of Whistler and his interaction with Scud.   If you're looking for a deep movie with a lot of character development then look somewhere else. The love interest is barely noticeable, you see Blade and Neesa eyeing each other but it never gets any further than that, which does not justify the tragic romantic ending by any means. Never the less B movies are not about plot, or character, that's why they call them B-movies, and that's what Blade 2 really is. Something that the original film failed to do. The movie is stupid, but still manages to be a lot of fun at the same time, despite some painfully CGI fights scenes that were absolutely unnecessary. People on wires look better!
