 Immaculate, innovative, undeniably king. Although sales for Dangerous never reached what Thriller or even Bad did (likely because of the backfiring publicity stunt that was the last two minutes of Black or White) it is undeniably his best work. Edgy, moving, sincere, and from a time when Michael's carrier wasn't as bogged down with having to proove something like he is now. Thriller and Smooth Criminal aside, MJ's best videos are in this collection. His best dancing, his most memorable moments, and the REAL video for Who Is It, not the MTV version (Which looks to me like the Dangerous video, redubbed with the music for Who Is It. The behind the scenes footage and additional material from that era as a nice touch as well making this DVD the best collection of videos, though History Pt2 is pretty good too. They need to release Moonwalker as well. It'd be nice if they would consider compiling his complete music videos too, I have yet to see the full length version of Bad, and I have only seen clips of Dirty Diana thanks to documentaries on VH1. I would like to have the entire Michael Jackson music video collection available on DVD. Hopefully that's comming soon. I miss the Dangerous era, MJ looked human back then, and despite the contraversies that ruined it for everyone Dangerous is his most underated album, and easily his edgiest and finest work. It's a shame that Invincible didn't reach the quality of this CD, the true platue of his carrere, though not in sales, people got scared off by the contraversy surrounding Black or White, and the incident involving Gordy Chandler, an obvious extortion issue for those who followed the case closely, but it still killed record sales. For those who missed this album and it's videos because of the controversy, pick this album up! And the DVD!
