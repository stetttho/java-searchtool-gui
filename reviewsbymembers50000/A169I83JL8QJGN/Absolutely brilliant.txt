 Its amazing to me how anytime something bad happens to me I always end up buying a CD that has someone singing about the very topics that I am dealing with at the time. In this case, my brother recommended the CD hoping to help me find something that would ease some things I was going through. I bought this CD and was amazed at the range of emotions this band emits during this CD. Perhaps this is my own personal interpretation, but it seems as though Stabbing Westward wrote an entire album dedicated to breaking up. The album begins with Darkest Days, a song about having to deal with his inner rage over having to be alone, to the short but amazing Save Yourself, which is basically a kiss off song. Each song covers a different emotion that is felt during the break up process, and every song is sung with such emotion that it had a true effect on me; I felt it, and something I haven't had happen to me with music in a long time. Perhaps this is just the way I interpet the CD. This band had sheer and raw talent. I have since learned that they have disbanded, which is a terrible shame because their music, from what I've heard was simply amazing.
