 When Nintendo first announced the DS I thought they had gone mad. Then I saw it in motion at E3 and it all made sense. Better yet was actually getting my hands on this fantastic little unit. While I was disappointed with the sound the graphics more than compete well against Sony's forthcoming PSP. The Metroid demo is awesome, and compete at nearly the same level of visual quality as it's Gamecube counterpart. Mario 64 DS is also awesome. I'm amazed by the output of this system. However, the launch line also disappoints me up. Only 6 games? Come on Nintendo! A good launch would need at twice this many games. Oh well. I know that there are some amazing games in the works; I would just like to buy more games for it now.  Update: Now that I've had some time to wait for decent new games I must express that I'm quite upset that Nintendo didn't have a better launch line up set up. The Final Fantasies I was looking forward to have all been pushed back, and the only noteworthy games for the system are the Urbz and Mario 64 DS. I have to wait clear until March before anything interesting comes out. The unit is innovative and fantastic, but what good does system power and innovation do when there's only 2 decent games for the system? COme on Nintendo! Let's get this show on the road!   Update: Over the last several months the NDS has had more than a handful of great games launch for it incluiding Viewtiful Joe Double Trouble, Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time, Castlevania, Dawn of Sorrow, and MArio Kart DS amung others. If you were waiting for noteworthy titles before picking up the unit now's a good time to do so. There's an onslaught of great titles already, and an even bigger onslaught of killer aps on the way, unlike the PSP, where we're still waiting for a single reason to justify the purchase.
