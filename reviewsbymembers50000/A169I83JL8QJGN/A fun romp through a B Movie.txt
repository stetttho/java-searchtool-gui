 I played this before I played the original Resident Evil. I had just barely gotten the Playstation and was renting a bunch of stuff. Originally I hated this game because I couldn't figure out how to play it. I had been a Nintendan with occasional defects to Sega (I own a Genisis) so I was unfamiliar with what has become a nearly standard control style for Playstation games. I didn't understand the pivoting, nor did I grasp the concept of holding R-1 to aim and X to shoot. I got frusterated and set it aside. However, my brother picked it up immediately after and managed to get me past the first screen. (Yes I got killed right away.) I watched my brother navigate his way through the game until he finally got killed by the first Licker. He begged me to buy it. So I did. After a while I decided to give it another try, and once I got used to the control style I beat it. I have played this this Resident Evil, and it many different incarnations across differnt platforms more than any other version. I have also bought this one the most times trying to get the "ultimate edition" and eventually got tired of it and bought the Dual Shock Greatest Hits version after the N64 version's FMV sequences were so terrible. Although I will not buy the forthcomming GameCube port unless they imporove it as drastically as they did the original, I still recomend RE 2 as the most fun of the series. If for some reason there is someone out there who does not already have some version of this game do yourself a favor and pick one up. GameCube owners, I recomend waiting for the GCN version as it is supposed to have all of the various enhancements that all of the various versions of this game had, including the much desired analog control the N64 version featured.
