 The premise of Mortal Kombat was never simple, the game got a lot of attention for its brutal gore, but the original was backed by a complex storyline about a demon sorceror trying to unbalance the Earth's furies so that his evil emporer could enter the realm of earth and take over. The storyline focused mostly on Lui Kang, the decendant of a shaolin munk who had been a great warrior and was defeated by Shang Tsung in an earlier tournament. Although the movie does change some elements of the story it still remains completely faithful to the spirit and story of teh original game. It follows the plot very closely, albiet less focus on Scorpion and Sub Zero, and for some odd reason they negelected to mention that Sub Zero was a good guy and that he was killed by Scorpion, but that's okay, it still remains faithful to the game. The dialogue is tounge-in-cheek, and there are some great one liners, and the movie version resembles the plot of Enter the Dragon. All in all this is how a game to movie translation should be done, although it would have been nice to see more of the classic power moves (fireballs and such) it still plays out very well. Its a shame that more game movies can't be this good.
