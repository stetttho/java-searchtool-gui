 I will confess I never finished this game, but thankfully I won't need to curtsey of the RE-make for GameCube. I had originally started this series with RE 2, and decided to back track to the first one for the sake of finding out who Chris was, and why Claire was looking for him. However the horrid control, horrid graphics were bearable, but the lousy voice acting was not. I couldn't stand it because here was a great classic B-Movie story (and I love B-movies) with F-Movie acting. Everything about this game became cheesy. I then bought the director's cut hoping for better voice acting... well at least I got my wish a couple weeks ago. I then bought the dual shock edition.... yeah, I'm kind of bitter, but I won't hold a grudge because Capcom and Nintendo provided me with what I wanted recently. But this game could have been better, even for the time it was released; at least the voice acting could have been better. Now that the remake is available with all the good things about the original intact, plus some fiercely improved graphics, sound and dialogue (although I miss the "Master of Unlocking" line) there is no need to bother with this game.
