 Out of the late 70s and through the earliy eighties came some of the greatest comedies that man kind has ever known. Amoung them the Sequel to Airplane. A satire film dedicated to mocking  disaster films (like Airport), and in this case, space disasters as the cast and crew are off to the first settlement on the moon when a sabature reeks havick on the computer system. The computer goes hayware and once again Stryker must save the day. Although the plot of this movie is pretty much the same as the first there is a slugh of new gags, plus some old ones revisited that makes this movie a great companion to the original. Like the first the movie is filled with many-a-hillarious moments that will keep just about anyone laughing. There are a few time sensative gags that some might not understand if they were not around for that era, but not as many as the original or other movies from this era. I was very happy when I got this DVD. However a warning to parents: although this movie is rated PG it does feature some brief nudity and a lot of PG-13 level jokes. This movie is not appropriate for children despite its PG rating.
