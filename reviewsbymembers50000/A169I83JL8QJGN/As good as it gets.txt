 While I am begging Capcom to reconsider the ground up remake for GameCube I think that it is safe to say that RE 2 Director's Cut Dual Shock whatever ediction is currently the definitive version of the game. The Aarange Mode makes this game slightly more interesteing than the original version, and while it makes it overly easy to play on Rookie mode nothing is more satifying than a rocket launcher with unlimited ammo. Especially on the B-sides when you're up agains the Tyrant who follows you arround like Nemisis does in RE 3, though not as much. The N64 version had garbled sound and grainey FMVs and was just not worth it, but did have one advantage over this version, the optional analogue control. Update the graphics, throw in analogue control and this game will be the best of the series again, but only if it keeps all the fun extras that this one has. This is the version I ended up settling for.
