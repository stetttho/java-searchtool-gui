 There are few comedies that can come close to touching the insanity of Mel Brooks. The man is a genius; there is not another way to describe it. He has done a parody film for just about every genre out there. In this film his target is Sci-Fi space operas. Star Wars, Star trek, Aliens and many other classics become the target of one massive farce on space adventures.  Spaceballs is without a doubt one of Brook's finest, and even has a few quotable scenes of its own. "Evil will always triumph because good is dumb."  The movie tells the story of a Druish princess who does not want to marry the royal pain Prince Valume. Rather than marry for her father's sake she runs away and is then attacked by Spaceballs who want to use her to blackmail her father into giving them the code to the air shield which guards 10,000 years of fresh air. The Spaceballs have nearly destroyed their planet and need to steal the air from Planet Druidia in order to save their own world.  Space cowboy Lonestar and his furry companion Barf are in debt to the notorious gangster Pizza the Hut. Thankfully the Druid King Rolland hires them to rescue his daughter from Spaceballs. The set up is clich sci-fi, and in that way its perfect for what Brooks set out to do. The problem with this movie is that the jokes do get tiresome. Unlike History of the World, Spaceballs has a limited view value. It is not a movie you could watch repeatedly and have it still be funny. If you take a "break" from it some of the laughs can be revived, but most of the gags do get old and stale after a while. It is still a worthy addition to anyone's DVD collection. Especially for the Mel Brooks commentary on the movie.
