 Dial up is too slow for me, so when Phantasy Star Online and the broadband Adapter became available I snagged both, intending to use high speed Internet as my means of playing online.   Nintendo's mistake with this device is the limited availability. The weakness of GameCube is solely its refusal to commit to a strong line up of online games. Here it is online ready, yet this adapter is difficult to find (but far from out of print) and there's only PSO that can be used with it. Thankfully, when you can find it through a retail outlet it is reasonably priced. You can actually take your 'Cube online for less than it costs to take your XBox online... although Microsoft really does have the better online plan. This is a great peripheral, I only hope that PSO isn't the only game to utilize it... lets get some Mario Kart!
