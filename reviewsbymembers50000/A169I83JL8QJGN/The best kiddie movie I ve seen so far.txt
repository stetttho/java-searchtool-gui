 I must admit that I am biased toward material specifically geared toward children. Very seldomly does a childrens movie contain material that is enjoyable for adults as well. When Harry Potter began to get popular I just ignored it, something I had learned to do when I got sick of the Pokemon mania that was ending just around that time. I had no desire to get involved with the Harry Potter franchise.   I was suprised that this movie seemed to begin planning and wrap shooting in six months. Two months later the movie was in theaters. When a movie is done in that short of time I tend to really doubt its ability to be a good movie. My parents begged and pleaded with me to visit them one night, and they had planned a trip to see this movie for a family activity. I didn't really want to go but I'm glad I did.  The movie was far from unenjoyable, and while the CGI effects were not spectacular the story was innovative, and fun despite being childish. The movie manages to be childish, but not immature, which makes it one of the most enjoyable kiddie flicks to date. I'm actually looking forward to the sequel.  The acting in this movie is spectacular. I have not seen such talent in youth since Haley Joel Osment. The actors were also well cast as far as appearances because the actors resemble the characters they are portraying more so than any other movie of its kind. I am very pleased with the way this movie was done. If the special effects were better it would have otten five stars from me.   I have not had time to check out the DVD extras yet, however just reading the back of the box has me itching for the time to do just that. I also must stress the importance of getting this movie in Widescreen I have seen both the Widescreen and Pan & [Scan] (Full screen) editions of this movie. You loose a lot of picture on the Pan & [Scan] version as the movie was presented in a 2:35:1 ratio, more than half of the picture is lost in the transition to "Full Screen".
