 When Nintendo released this as a freebee for the GCN last year in the Zelda collection I didn't mind at all that the frame rates dips and flickering problems of the old NES edition were still present. It was obvious that the game (which had a significant resolution boost but not much more) was being emulated by the GCN, and had not been really ported. It was free, so I didn't mind. All I needed to do as renew my Nintendo Power subscription, which I intended to do anyway. Now the game has been re released for GBA, once again, emulation, and not a port. I must state first that if you have the GCN Zelda Collection its not worth it to buy the GBA Legend of Zelda. Its fun, and the classic still holds up in its entertainment value even though it's a nearly 20-year-old game. I love Zelda to tears which is why I'm still giving it four stars, however, owning the GCN version and having played the GBA edition (courtesy of a friend who let me borrow it) I can honestly say that I don't think its worth paying the $20 to own this game yet again. If you don't have it definitely get it but be ware... The original Zelda was built on a relatively weak 8-bit console. The GBA is a relatively powerful 32 bit handheld specifically designed to take full advantage of sprite based games. The fact that Nintendo is charging $20 for such an old game but could not be bothered to eliminate the frequent and annoying slowdown really makes me mad. Capcom did it for Mega Man! Why couldn't Nintendo be bothered to do it for Zelda? On the plus side, they did remove the flickering that plagued the original and the GCN emulation. It would have been nice if the frame rate dips were worked out too. It could have been done; shoot it wouldn't have been much work for them to do it for the GCN. The difference is that now you do have to pay for this game, and Nintendo should be ashamed of themselves for not eliminating the frame rate dips, which can and do hinder the game play frequently.
