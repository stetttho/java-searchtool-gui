 October 2000. I like many other Playstation 1 fans lined up at the local game store and camped out. I like many disappointed fans didn't get my mega hyped Playstation 2. December I paid five hundred dollars for it. The PS 2 has been a disaster for me. While I admit that I use it as a DVD player the last two years have yielded a mere eight games for my collection. In fact, this year I have purchased only one game for my PS2, and it was a used copy of Devil May Cry that I got very cheap.  The sad fact of the matter is that of the current consoles on the market PS2 is the weakest. Its online plan is a joke, and its games are generic corporate manufactured garbage that lack artistic integrity, with the occasional Capcom, Konami, and Squaresoft exceptions.   PS2 may be the best selling console on the market, but as far as I'm concerned its practically dead, with only Xenosaga and Final Fantasy X-2 in the foreseeable future capturing my interest, all other PS 2 games that I'd be interested in have GameCube or Xbox ports that will become available later. I do not see that Playstation 2 has any advantages over the competition at all. Sony promised a revolution, and while the sales for this system have been awe inspiring the games have been anything but. At this point if you can't afford all three systems I recommend trading your PS 2 in for an Xbox or a GameCube. Rumor has it Xenosaga may be brought to GCN a little later anyway. Sorry, but Playstation's lost its steam. With only one game to be added to my collection this year I cannot express my utter disappointment with this system. The other seven games I bought were bought over the course of the year 2001. GameCube, in contrast has had fourteen titles added to my library in the last year, and Xbox 7. While my opinions shift on which console is offering me the most noteworthy games right now I have GameCube in first, Xbox in second, and PS2 at a distant third.
