 Since the advent of computer animation puppets are becoming more and more rare, so Avenue Q (a loose parody of Sesame Street) was a nice treat, and a very well done production. I've become quite a huge fan of the production since my sister played the "Internet lesson" for me while I was visiting with my parents. My initial reaction to the song was "what the...?" But Once I understood what Ave. Q was I found myself laughing nonstop. One thing I should note however, that while this album and its puppets are hilarious, and a lot of fun this is definitely not a show intended for children. I would definitely recommend buying this CD for an adult however, its catchy tunes not only demand repeat listening, but that you sing along! It is one of the best CDs to hit shelves this year.
