 The fist game in a long time to have me drooling over it's graphics. The first of a small handful of PS2 games that genuinely look good. The voice acting is a bit too quiet though, and if you're dumb like me and turn the subtitles off you miss a lot of the dialogue. The overall story, however, is great. I rather enjoyed the way the story tried to tie into real Japanese history the way that White Wolf games try to tie the World of Darkness into our own creating a somewhat believeable horror story. The best part of this game, however, is it's fully orchistrated sound track, simply put it's one of the most amazing soundtracks ever written for a game. The puzzels and fetch quests are managable and you will not likely need a strategy guide for this game, not that it's easy, but if you take a few minutes to stop and think about what you're doing you can figure it all out on your own, which is nice. You feel so much smarter when you figure a game like this out on your own. For it's merrits, there are however some major flaws. The control scheme, once again Capcom refused to abandon the archaic Resident Evil style controls, which makes combat a little more difficult than it needed to be, but thankfully once you adjust to the agonizing control mechanics and build up your weapons and learn the magic spells and special moves it becomes easier, plus you can block and perry which is helpful. Devil May Cry is much better, but this was a good prelude. The game was also the first in what seems to be a trend in hotly anticipated titles that present a strong story, great graphics, great sound, but can be beaten in less than six hours, and is just flat out too short, way too short. I clocked in at about 2 and a half hours. I'd like developers to start making longer games again. Here's hoping for a longer sequel, and one that will play less like Resident Evil, and more like Devil May Cry.
