 I can't possibly give this movie the five stars I would like to. It's been a long time since I've seen it until I found it at Wal-Mart. I bought it, and very eagerly watched it, and while I still love it I am also no longer marred by being a child, the flaws of this movie are simply that its dated now. Michelangelo's comment about "video games in 3D" garnered a chuckle out of me because for over almost a decade now video games have been in 3D.   Its kind of weird how this works. As a child I didn't much care for the first Turtles movie, but as an adult suddenly the humor makes sense and I find it to be a very enjoyable flick, in contrast, TMNT 2, which was my favorite as a child of the TMNT trilogy, now seems... well... childish. Its not that this movie is unenjoyable, as its still a fun movie, just don't expect the depth of something like... say X-Men, or Spider-Man, the type of super hero movies I tend to go for now. I think its safe to say that I've out grown the Ninja Turtles. Still, as a Jim Henson fan, I'm still glad I have this movie now, as I am a Henson completist and am trying to get every Henson related film on DVD. I may be single still, but I hope to have a family someday, and it will be great to be able to show these types of movies to my children who will likely find more entertainment value out of this particular installment than I did.  Please don't misunderstand the review, its not that I don't like this film, it's just that as an adult, the first movie was a lot better.
