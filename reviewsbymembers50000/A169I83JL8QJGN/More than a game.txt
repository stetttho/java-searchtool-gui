 Gothic Punk is oft the term used to describe the setting, thanks to the "Brew Jshaw" (I will forever mock that unforgivable mispronounciation) alot of people interpet this as being a "goth/punk" game...But there's so much more to this game than eighties fashion victimes with pink mohawks and eyebrow piercings, there's a clan for all walks of life. This is NOT a "Goth" game. This is a GOTHIC game, Gothic meaning dark themes. And Ventrue is pronouced as it's spelled!... More than a game, VTM is a statement about the fall of human society, and how humanity has lost it's humanity and become a beast, a statement about the struggle to maintain some semblance of sanity in a world that has gone to hell in a hand basket, a World of Darkness. Vampire is the focal point of WOD, and it is also the best of the series, a game that focuses on the thinning line between being human and becomming a beast. And while Goths might feel right at home in the anarchist arms of the Brujah, this game is NOt just for Goths. If you're a mature mind this game's for you, you're bound to find some clan or bloodline you can identify with. Daniel A. Moir Tooele Primogen of the Clan Toreador Viva Le Camarilla!
