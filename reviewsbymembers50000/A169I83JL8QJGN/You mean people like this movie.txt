 If ever there were a lesson on how not to translate a popular video game series into a movie it would be Mortal Kombat Annihilation and Tomb Raider. Both movies are B-Grade and only good for an MST3K party at midnight. Tomb Raider was torn apart by the critics, and with good reason. It features no coherent plot, mediocre acting, poorly planned action scenes, and dialogue so bad it makes an episode of Barney seem like Legacy of Kain... not that the games were much better. The game is well known for [poor] graphics, and horrid control, I guess the same could be said of the movie, and while Angelina doesn't pivot around to change direction, she may as well have. The story of this movie is just bad. When asked to summarize it's plot a friend of mine said "Jiggle jiggle splash splash, jiggle jiggle", and when we pressed further and asked for the moral of the story he simply replied "Kaploowey". I think that pretty much sums it up pretty well. While Jolie is a beauty, this film is not. It is over hyped garbage if I ever saw it. It is an excellent MST3K (Mystery Science Theater) movie though.
