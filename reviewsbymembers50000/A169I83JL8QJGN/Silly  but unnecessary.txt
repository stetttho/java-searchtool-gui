 Let's face it; Disney does not have a good track record with sequels. Often times the Disney sequels are more to capitalize on a brand name than to advance the story any. This is the case with Lion King 1/2 unfortunately. Wanting to capitalize on the recent DVD release of the Masterpiece The Lion King Disney not only put out the direct to DVD Behind-the-scenes-quill, but also re-released the lackluster "Simba's pride". While all three films are enjoyable both 1/2 and Simba's Pride lack the heart and visual quality of the original. It's sadly overly obvious that Disney does not follow the usual Hollywood tactic of putting more money in to the sequels. Nope, it's all about a quick buck. Thankfully I do feel that while this movie wasn't what I had hoped for it is worth the money to pick it up, especially if you have kids, or plan to have kids. What was I hoping for? Well, the slapstick antics were there, but in much smaller quantities than Timone and Pumba's television series which is a far better laughter-fest than 1/2. I did enjoy the Mystery Science Theater like antics of this film as well, but found that the movie didn't really add anything to the lore of the Lion King. We already knew Timone was an outcast Merekat... It's just... well an unnecessary addition to the series. It's fun, but I'd have much rather seen Disney release a box set of the Timone and Pumba TV Series.
