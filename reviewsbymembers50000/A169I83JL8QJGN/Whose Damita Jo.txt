 It's rather awkward having to write a somewhat negative review for a CD that seems to be pretty well received, however this album is only a so-so effort from this legendary and controversial artist. I've been a long time fan of the Jackson family (from an artistic standpoint) and so I have fairly high expectations that are difficult to reach. Janet has never eclipsed the artistic integrity of her fourth album Rhythm Nation 1814, nor has she eclipsed the sexy suave brilliance of her fifth, entitled simply "Janet." Although her first two albums are not very well known (as they were produced while her father was her manager, and thus she has done little to remind people of them) this is in fact her ninth album. It's also the third in a series of overly sexually explicit material. Its as if Janet has lost the heart of Control, the strength of Rhythm Nation, and the sexiness of Janet to sheer and utter trashiness that is plaguing the pop industry.   Despite the fact that I was disgusted by many of the lyrics, I do have to hand it to Miss Jackson for coming up with tunes that are absolutely brilliant. This album is filled with great and catchy tunes that demand repeat listening. It's just a shame that so few songs on this album are about something other than sex. This being the third album like this I am beginning to wonder if she has lost her lyrical talents which once made her my absolute favorite singer... or maybe its just a phase she'll eventually outgrow. Noteworthy tracks: R&B Junkie Thinking' about my Ex Don't Stop
