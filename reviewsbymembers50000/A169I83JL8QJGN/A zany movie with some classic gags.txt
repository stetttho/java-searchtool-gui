 Back in the late 80s and early 90s comedies used to be funny. Now a days everything is crude language and volgar bathroom humor that is not pleasing, and is offensive for a lot of moderatley conservative folks like myself. Even the latest National Lampoons films are mostly vulgar toilet humor and aren't that funny anymore. Loaded Weapon One was made in an era transitioning between being funny and being crude, the movie does have some toilet humor elements but its handled well, and its still a movie that relies on genuine silliness to entertain the viewer. A spoof of the Leathal Weapon series (and a few other movies that were popular at the time) the movie follows the classic parody formula with dim witted characters in absurdly silly situations. Many of the gags in this spoof movie were completely unique from other movies of this genre, I especially liked it when Emilio Esteves tripped over the subtitles. We need to go back to comodies along these lines, as modern comdey leaves something to be desired. If you are a comedy fan do yourself a favor and pick this one up.
