 Lets face it people, this is the reason you bought a Playstation. Its the game that made me buy one. Although the game is not without its problems that are irritatingly noticble now (a horrible translation, bad grammer, etc) for its time this game was revolutionary. Square made great use of FMV technology to progress this very anime like story line. FF VII is one of three titles argued to be the best of them (VI, VII and VIII), and is the game that started the RPG revolution that made Playstation what it is today.   These days this game is sorely dated and this game should be remade using GCN technlogy. I do not believe that they should make it realistic. Idealy I'd like to see them use toon shading in this remake idea to replace the 3D monstosities which were featured in the game originally. The original charcter models were inconsistant and largely overly blocky. However the battle scenes and major FMVs offered a whole lot of anime potential. This game needs to be toon shaded!
