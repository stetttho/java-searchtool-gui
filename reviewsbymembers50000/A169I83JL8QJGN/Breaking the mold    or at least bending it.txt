 Star Trek and Final Fantasy share two things in common, only the even numbered ones are any good, and number seven breaks that mold, even though thier even numbered counterparts are still better. In this case Generations has a great deal of comedic elements that make this movie very enjoyable, even if the film a little short, and lacking in action sequences. The premise is pretty lame as well. I never was akin to the idea of a Kirk/Picard team up because they are two very different characters, whith two very different styles, and I grew up in the Picard era (I think I was 7 when the show premiered.) I have a deep love of Star Trek TNG, and DS9 and to be honest I detest the Original for its bad acting and cheesy sound effects. I understand that the show is older than dirt, but still... The Trek movies were pretty good though.. Shatner's bad acting was still present, but he actually did pretty good in this film. What was the most enjoyable part of this movie was Data, as he installs the emotion chip and begins to experiment with humor. Even though a lot of the silliness wouldn't fly in real life it works for this movie because... it doesn't fly in Trek either. The reactions of Data's peers are just as humorous as Data himself. And to be honest Data's overall silliness really make this film. While the story is neither sweeping, nor epic it is engaging and entertaining. This could have been longer, and better but it is still a lot better than other odd numbered Trek films.
