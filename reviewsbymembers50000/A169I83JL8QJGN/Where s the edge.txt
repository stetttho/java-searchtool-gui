 I am probably one of a few remaining die hard MJ fans. I love the music, the dancing and everything that he has done in the past, including History. By far Dangerous is his best work and when the album Invincible was first announced I had hoped that it would mark a return to his edgy but not whiney Dangerous type work, and a few of the tracks retain the edgy pop/hard rock edge that I've come to expect since Bad. However, when i buy a Michael Jackson CD I expect to dance, and I'm single and this album is almost all slow songs, and not having a dace partner they're useless to me. I use MJ music to work out, and dancing in his style is at least 30 minutes a day of my routeen. This album is a dissapointment in the dance music area because of the 16 tracks only six are danceable, and only 5 of those are medium impact, and I like high impact like Scream, or Jam. There are no high impact dance songs here. The Album, over all is good, don't get me wrong, Michael is without argument the best ballad singer out there, with only Darren Hayes (formerly of Savage Garden) coming close to matching MJ's smooth vocals. However the songs here are only good, they're not great. Many of them seem a bit generic, more something that I would expect from the BS boys or N'Synch rather than the King of Pop. Mind you, this album is good, but far from great. I only hope that this isn't his last CD, becuase this certainly isn't going out with a bang.
