 Some have said that Fellowship of the Ring is the movie George Lucas was trying to make with Star Wars before he lost sight of his vision. While Star Wars is still a masterpiece as a whole in its own right, Fellowship of the Ring is the perfect epic fantasy adventure, with very few flaws. The only complaint I have is that some of my favorite moments from the book did not make it into the movie. Quite frankly I hardly noticed that the movie is as long as it is and would have happily sat through 6, or even 12 hours of a masterpiece like this.  We all know the story, so I will not write a synopsis, but I will say that I feel that each character was casted perfectly, and even Liv Tyler performed brilliantly. The scenery and attention to detail was amazing, and how they went through great lengths to ensure that every culture of the different races of Middle Earth was also amazing. I watch this movie, and every time I see it I am in awe of the grandeur of it all. This movie is grand, sweeping and epic, and aside from a few minor technical glitches (Frodo wearing shoes in one scene, Gandolf in hiking boots in another) this movie is the fantasy film I have longed to see since I was a child. I am eagerly awaiting the Two Towers.
