 It is very rare that an individual member of a group can go solo and pull off a good CD. Several members of the Spice Girls have tried and failed, and there have also been efforts of individual Back street Boys that are completely forgettable as well. I was very upset when Savage Garden (my favorite pop group, or Duo, at least) split up, mostly because Darren Hayes is the world's second best male vocalist (second only to the legendary Michael Jackson) and I had feared that he would not be releasing anything after that. Thankfully he has done so.   The fear with these sort of efforts is that they will not live up to the artists previous efforts, and while the Savage Garden dbut album is still a better CD than Spin, Spin is actually leaps and bounds better that SG's sophomore CD Affirmation. This was a relief for me.   Not only is Spin better than Affirmation by leaps and bound, but also it is the sort of album I was hoping to get from Michael Jackson's Invincible. Darren's music is very danceable, and edgy in its own right. He sings about a lot of things not sung about in pop music. Deep topics such as betrayal, depression, and even stalking are covered, not something one would expect in this genre, but much appreciated.   My favorite songs off this CD would be Insatiable, Heart attack, and Spin. The entire album is noteworthy, however. Essentially its a must have for any music fan who hasn't purchased it already.
