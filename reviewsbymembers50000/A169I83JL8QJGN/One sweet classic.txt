 Looming in the near future is a Tim Burton remake of the classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (the title of the book from which Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is based.) Tim Burton arrogantly proclaimed that the original film was unnecessarily sappy. I had very fond memories of this film and so my wife and I purchased it hoping to see if Tim Burton was right about this movie needing to be remade to be more "true to the book".   Thanks to the special features we discovered that Roald Dahl (The author of the book) had been responsible for the screen play, with some help of course, but even so the fact that the very man who wrote the book wrote the screenplay means that only this version of the film can come close to the author's vision of his story.  When translating a book to film sacrifices have to be made, and in Willy Wonka's case those sacrifices are more so by way of omission than complete overhauls of the story. While the book is different, the flow, the heart, and soul of Roald Dahl's classic tale remain, as does the over all story. What I realized is that while I love Johnny Depp, and Tim Burton the original Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory has held its own since the very early 1970s, and is still a much loved family classic now some 35 years later. A remake is not necessary, and although I look forward to Tim Burton's interpretation Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka for my family and I. In short, this movie is as wonderfully entertaining, and dark, and fun as it was in the 70s. Tim Burton is only kidding himself if he thinks that the original doesn't hold up by today's standard.
