 Although some may critizize Nintendo for being too reliant on it's franchises Nintendo always manages to make these franchise titles the best thier respective genre has to offer. Mario the best platformer, Zelda the best Action RPG, Metroid the best adventure, and Super Smash Bros Melee the best fighter...   Most fighter games get old within a few days, but I've had this game since December and I'm still finding more than enough things to do in this game to keep me busy, and I'm beginning to wonder if there is even an end to all the things to unlock! So many trophies, side quests, alternate modes, and the more you complete the more you unlock, this game is simply amazing.  This game is not the pinacle of the GameCubes graphical power, but for the most part it still manages to stand above the competing consoles. The backgrounds could have had more detail, but the characters looks imply amazing, and the real time clips mixed into the FMV movie at the beginning show such a smoth transition between prerendered and real time graphics you start to realize that GamCube is definately the most underrated system of the batch. The sound of this game is simply great, and the adventure mode gives gamers a chance to live the fantasy of playing through Super MArio Bros as Samus Aaron... though it would have been nice to have had the adventure mode a little longer and more elaborate (especially the metroid inspire level.) This game is nearly perfect for it's genre, and most importantly the game is a blast! I haven't had this much pure fun in a very long time.
