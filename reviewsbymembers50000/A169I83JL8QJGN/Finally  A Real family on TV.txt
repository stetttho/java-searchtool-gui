 We're all dysfunctional, and as such its been kind of insane to see perfect TV families like those seen in Full House, and Home Improvement, and the other TV sitcoms I've grown up with. My family certainly wasn't like that. I adore my siblings, and now that I'm 23 I get along much better with my parents than I did as a pre-teen, or even worse, as a teen.   Unlike many sitcoms of the past, I can identify much easier with Malcolm in the Middle. I'm the oldest of my family, but I can feel for Malcolm, because a lot of what he goes through at school happened to me as well. The tale of a boy genius with a knack for getting into trouble is a very personal tale to me, and so Malcolm in The Middle very quickly became my favorite TV sitcom... a genre I usually avoid like the plague. Finally a normal family is on the airwave, and they're so normal it actually makes me appreciate my family a lot more!   Its funny how everyone says at the moment that one day you'll look back and laugh... This is true. Suddenly the stuff I used to get into trouble for is hilarious, as were my parent???s clever punishments. My family and I watch this show and laugh while we compare notes on what happened when we were kids. My mom denied that she's a lot like Louis until she saw the episode where she found her red dress burnt and in the toilet... the clever, but not physically violent disciplinary actions were nearly identical to an incident involving me and some ceramics my mom bought... except in my story, I was the guilty party, not my dad...   It???s easy for me to declare Malcolm in the Middle the funniest show on TV, simply because of its slapstick view of otherwise serious issues. The show makes light of the average American family, and succeeds in getting the point across... even the insanely brilliant can do stupid things.
