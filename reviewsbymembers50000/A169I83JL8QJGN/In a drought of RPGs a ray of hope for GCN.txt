 Originally released during the final days of the Dreamcast I was introduced to Skies of Arcadia when a friend of mine bought it for me for Christmas. It's the only video game I have ever received for Christmas so it was quite an appreciated gift! Nevertheless hard times caused me to part with the DC original for some quick cash. I was relieved when they announced the title for the GameCube, with some additional material.   While there are a few new elements added to the saga I must confess that by and large the game is largely true to the original, which can be both good and bad. In the ways its good is that the story remains largely unchanged, and what has changed helps to advance the story. However the game's graphics have not been enhanced much at all, and on my TV (Wide screen, HD, and 53") the graphical flaws can really stand out. While the colors seem more vibrant, but there is visible rendering quite close to the main character as he navigates the game. The scenery looks muddy, but smoothes out gradually as Vyse approaches, and you can actually see the lines render the graphics. This was an eye sore in the original, and I had hoped Sega would fix it, but they didn't. Character models are far from impressive by today's standard, and let's face it; the day of random encounters is long past. Games like Chrono Cross and Xenosaga have shown an encounter system that is a lot more fun. Battles in Skies can go for a very long time, but that doesn't mean they aren't fun. I just wish I could skip the opening animations for the battles.   Despite the games flaws its still a fun story, with loveable and memorable characters. And the game play mechanics, while traditional and even clich' are still a lot of fun. Its definitely a must have for RPG fans, even though its not perfect.
