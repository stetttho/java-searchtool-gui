 ...In my childhood one of my all time favorites was the failed attempt at a movie he did called UHF. While the film did not loose money it failed to generate any revenue large enough to call it a success, and despite being blasted by critics of the day the movie's real problem was not the movie itself, but the film's release date. It was put out in the middle of one of the biggest summer blockbuster battles of the day. It was up against movies like Batman and When Harry Met Sally and these weren't the only ones! UHF was a small movie releasing against several large movies. It didn't stand a chance and it was crushed.  Thankfully the movie found its way into the hearts of B-movie fans via TV and home video. However, with the demise of Orion in 1996 the video vanished off the face of the earth. Sadly, before I could get a copy of it on VHS. Over the years demand for the movies return has been running rampant. The movie has a cult following as strong as the following of the other cult B-movie classic "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." This movie is not as quotable as Monty Python's movie, but its just as funny. Literally by popular demand the cult classic is now on DVD with completely restored video and audio that makes the movie look new, deleted scenes that suck to no end, but are worth watching just to hear Al comment about how bad they suck, and a very informative and hilarious audio commentary with Weird Al, his manager, and several of the stars of the movie. This movie is not time sensitive; the gags that were used 13 years ago are still funny today. This film is a must own for everybody. Simply put, quit reading this and go buy this DVD! You know you want it!
