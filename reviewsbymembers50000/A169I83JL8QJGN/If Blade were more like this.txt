 Dunpeals, Dhampirs, Dhampyrs, and daywalkers, all essentially different terms for the same thing. A little known Romani legend tells the tale of the son of Dracula who was half human, and half vampire, vampirojenovic/lampirojenovic, son of the vampire, or Dhampir. Vampire hunter D takes that basic premise renames the Dhampir Dunpeal and goes from there. The movie itself is intriging, and dark, but the art work and animation could have been better, as it is nothing compared to the recent Vampire Hunter D sequel. Over all this movie is interesting, but nothing about it is scary, and D is a bit too distant to get emotionally attached to, although his hand more than makes up for D's lack of dialogue. This movie is one of the best animes ever created, and should be added to every DVD anime fan's collection.  It is lacking in specila features though, aside from a rather uninformative making of featurett there is nothing substantial here. The Tranfer is slightly better than the VHS version, but again nothing substanial, the sound is a lot better though, but still not as good as it could have been, however this disk is worth the purchase for the movie alone.
