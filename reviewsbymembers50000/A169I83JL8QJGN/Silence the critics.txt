 Confusion is criticle to maintaining Silent Hill's atmosphere, so those complaining that the story is confusing, knock it off, it's meant to be. There are a lot of questions I'd like answered, but thankfully Konami has created a game that leaves you walking away just as disturbed as confused. The only game that could surpass Silent Hill in the disturbing arena is Silicon Knight's forth comming Eternal Darkness.  Silent Hill 2 addresses the complaints I had about the first one, the option to have a point and go there control style is there. So I just go, no pivoting! The problem is that the camera was not designed for this control method, and so it has a few quirks. Nothing too drastically bad, but it really needed work. It's sadly not as disturbing as the first one though, it seems that Konami has bent to the will of irresponsible parents blamming games for thier kid's problems and toned the game down dramatically from what it was. Over all though the game is still a good renter. The reason I recomend renting this is because there is a director's cut in the works for XBox that is comming out soon. It will have much more material than this one, and while I hate it when people do director's cuts it's nice that Konami announced that they were going to do this in time enough to stop me from buying the PS2 version. I'll be able to get the definitive version right off the bat, rather than wasting my money on an incomplete game.
