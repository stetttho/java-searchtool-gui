 Musicians who love music are all over classical music. No other style can be more expressive, and more effective in causing the mind to create its own "images", if you will, than classical. Classical music is also the most under apreciated music out there. There isn't enough focus on it, and the vast majority of music sales fall under the rock catagorey. But classical, and neo classical remain my favorite genre. As such, the two Fantasia films are amoung my favorite DVD collection on a shelf for all to see, rather than in a DVD storage box like the majority of my collection. I will confess that I never got around to watching the third disk of this collection, but I really enjoyed the movies despite the agrivating cuts made to the original to make it more "politically correct" (I don't know why people get so upset about such trivial things, but oh well.) My only concern is the condition of the original. Neither the sound or the video was as good as it could have been. Perhaps it is because the original footage is so old, but it does make one wonder why Disney didn't take the oportunity to try and restore the film during the nineties. Mr. Lucas did it with Star Wars, and granted Fantasia is much older than Star Wars, but the film preservation could have been better. They could have restored it earlier, thus saving more of the visual flare that I believe this film has lost due to the age of the footage. Because they did not do this the film looks pretty bad. But the movie is more so about the music anyway, which thankfully was restored earlier in the films "life". While Fantasia may be boring for some, for music lovers it is a must have, and the DVD format will give you the best possible presentation of these two spectacular films.
