 I remember getting excited over the Super GameBoy way back in the day, a device that Nintendo put out for the Super NES that not only allowed the SNES to play GameBoy games, but also colorized them (to an extent.) It was fun for me to be able to play the games on the TV because I've always had difficulty seeing small details that can be lethal on the small screen. I also got annoyed by having to constantly replace batteries, and never was willing to front the cash to buy an ac adaptor for it. The Super GameBoy was a solution to many problems for me in the handheld arena, but I was really upset when I found out that the GameBoy Color games didn't work on it.   Nintendo has brought us an updated version of the Super GameBoy in the form of the GameBoy Player. I was afraid of what the GBA and older games would look like on the big screen as with the Super GameBoy the games looked horrid, but now I am in awe of the GameBoy Advance as a whole. I had no idea that these games looked as good as they do. Some of the games (Metroid Fusion, Tactics Ogre, and Castlevania Aria of Sorrow in particular) are absolutely breathtaking on the big screen! It's like having a Super NES all over again. The nostalgia has overwhelmed me and I can't help but want to shake hands with Nintendo and thank them for this device. Not only did they succeed in bringing GameBoy Advance to the big screen, they found a way to do it and make the games look not just good, but great. Granted some games don't transition quite so well. Castlevania Circle of the moon in particular, on the big screen you notice how choppy the animation really was, but for the most part, from the games I've been playing they look and play great! Thank you Nintendo!
