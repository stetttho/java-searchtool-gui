 Fans of American Idol, like myself, probably were responsible for sending this album to the top of the charts by a ton of preorders, as well as swarming music stores to buy the album. However when I eagerly plugged my copy of this CD into my CD player on the way home from the music store where I had reserved mine I noticed something sorely lacking in this album: ingenuity and innovation.   With American Idol's emphases on being unique and original I am sorely disappointed that last years winner, Kelly Clarkson, ends up releasing a CD with lyrics that are almost identical to everything else that has been released by a now cheap and generic pop genre. These pop stars have been using the same rhyme scheme for years. When will it end? Can we please have something more creative than rhymes we've heard a million times before? "You feel I'm real" was a line used in Michael Jackson's "2000 Watts", using the exact same lyrics is plagiarism, or so I thought... okay so its only one line, but still! Insaine-Brian pain, love-above, you-do, me-be-see... its been done to death.  I suppose that I am so frustrated with this CD because of Simon Cowell. Simon seemed like a real visionary, and his label releasing an album that is the same old same old, new voice-same song sort of deal is a huge let down. I had expected an album full of brilliantly written songs like "A Moment Like This" and "Before your love", and while I still love those two songs the rest of the album is just typical over hyped generic pop. In all honesty only die hard American Idol fans could enjoy this, as its an album clearly meant for fourteen year old girls, not 23 year old men who have been longing for truly innovative music in general for a very long time. This does not mean that I don't like Kelly though. I think she has an amazing voice, but this album was not that good. Maybe her next album will be better. If not there's always Clay Aikein (My bet for the next American Idol.)
