 Jack Black is one of my favorite actors at the moment, so I've come to expect a lot more crazy antics from him. I'm not a fan of Saving Silverman, but that movie had a lot more craziness that I expect from MTV films. This movie, while good, lacked a lot of the craziness I had anticipated, and a completely different plot than I expected. The commercials lead me to believe that the movie would have Jack Black being accepted to the school in lou of the character played by Colin Hanks. This set up would have potential for a lot of crazy comedy. This isn't how the story goes.  My disappointment with this film is not that the plot was different its that the movie comes off as more of a drama than a crazy comedy. Don't get me wrong, it has quite a few moments, just not as many as I would have liked. Now as a drama, I would give this movie a higher rating. Mr. Hanks character has the ideal girlfriend, and a near perfect relationship with her. I think most of us guys out there would give anything to have someone like her. His family is a bit on the loopy side though, and it is they who serve the comedy antics that barely pass this film off as a comedy. However, the characters all have serious and very real issues that pull us away from the comedy momentarily too.   Its a great story, but more of a renter than a buyer.
