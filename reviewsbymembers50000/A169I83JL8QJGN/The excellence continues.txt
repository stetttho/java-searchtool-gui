 At the height of Star Trek popularity the producers of the show created a spin off about a man who'd lost his wife, and was assigned to command the recently wrestled from Cardassian control Terok Nor (Renamed Deep Space Nine by the Federation of Planets). His name, Benjamin Sisko... And he didn't want to be there. Regardless, being the good soldier that he is he takes his son and relocates to the station where he meets the moody Kira Nyrese, the shape shifting Odo, the scheming Quark, and a reincarnation (sort of) of his old friend Dax.   What I love about Deep Space Nine is that it removed the cowboy diplomacy of previous installments. The crew of DS9 was stationary, and had to deal with the consequences of their actions, unlike Kirk and Picard who could just fly off to the next planet, Sisko was stuck dealing with the problems that were created.   Season 2 does not delve into the Dominion much, but begins to hint at their existence, in introduces us to their minions, the Jem'Haddar. There's a lot to love about this season as the foreshadows of the future that's still somewhat fresh on everyone's mind begins here. We learn a lot of interesting things about the characters, and they continue to develop incredibly well.   Because DS9 developed its characters so well it is, in my mind, the best of the treks. I am grateful to Paramont for these box sets, though I do feel they are awefully expensive (Fox's 24 in contrast runs about $50-60 a set). A price drop would be nice, but as of now I'm only two seasons short of the collection. Deep Space Nine is TV as it should be. Great stories with great role models for our kids, episodes that are completely inoffensive, and completely entertaining. I wish DS9 had never ended. Of all of the TV shows I love that are now gone I miss DS9 the most.
