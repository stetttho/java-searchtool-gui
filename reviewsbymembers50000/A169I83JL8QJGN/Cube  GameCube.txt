 When I first played this game on the PS2 I had two major complaints, first the horendous loading time was inexcusable for the PS2, when I bought the system it was under the impression that load times were a thing of the past, the other was the lack of blood. Goldeneye was realistically bloody and still pulled of a T rating. Although I could also complain about the graphics I must also acknowledge the beautiful lip synching.  The GameCube port adresses at least one of the major complaints, and while it still seems cheesy to shoot someone in the head and not draw blood it also makes the game somewhat more shild friendly, I guesse... it's still not Goldeneye.  The voice acting in this game is superb as the voice actors sound very much like their movie counterparts, and the storyline itself is typical bond fan fair. This game is not without it's flaws, colission detection can be a bit off sometimes, and the control set up takes some getting used to, but over all it's still a lot of fun.  Nintendo GameCube also addressed the loading issue, as it is lightniong quick now and barely noticable. This game is fun, short, but fun, and a worthwhile purchase, but be warned that this was a PS 2 game first and it shows. Little was done to improve the graphics, this game is far from the pinacle of GCN graphics.
