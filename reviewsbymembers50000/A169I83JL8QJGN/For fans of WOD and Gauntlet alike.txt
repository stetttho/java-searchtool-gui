 My XBox is used to rent games. I have yet to buy any. I have a decent sized collection of PS 2 and GameCube games. The XBox has been a dust collector for a while.   This weekend I decided to do some renting to see if there is anything of value for the system yet, and thankfully there is. I know I could get blasted by Halo fans for not acknowledging it as the "best game ever" but Eternal Darkness has my vote for that, and Halo is a first person shooter that will be out done by Metroid Prime shortly. Usually I don't like First Person Shooters anyway. After many months Hunter: The Reckoning has made my purchase worthwhile. It's not a lot on story, but the pen and paper RPG can be like this as well. Unlike its sister World of Darkness games Vampire, and Mage, Hunter features a lot more of the "Hack and slash" gore fest than other World of Darkness games. The Pen and paper version still has a lot of room for character development and depth, something that the video game does not. What that game does offer is breathtaking visuals that are almost, but not quite, as good as GameCube's Resident Evil, fast paced Gauntlet like action, and a multiplayer game that beast out Gauntlet on many levels. Although it could be argued that the game more resembles Gauntlet than the pen and paper game that it is based on, but this is not a bad thing. A modern day Gauntlet is a beautiful thing, both graphically and game play wise. My only complaint is that the boss battles are too difficult to handle with just one or two players. It's only when you have all four that the bosses are doable, and even then they're difficult.   Hunter is a sigh of relief for me. This one game has given me hope for this otherwise disappointing console. Perhaps XBox will have other World of Darkness based games that will be more story focused. Its not that the story is bad, just thin. It's still a great game though. It's worth it to get an XBox for Hunter alone.
