 Time travel is a subject that is far too common in the Star Trek universe, when I first found out that time travel would be a focus of this movie I was worried that it would [NOT BE GOOD]. Thankfully this movie turned out to be the best entry in the series. The character of Picard finally showed a ruthless dark side that was in many ways as terrifying as the Borg he was so desperate to destroy. It's side of Picard that is rarely seen and very welcome. Picard has usually been the disciplined, yet kind hearted captain, and my favorite of the various Trek captains, so to see that he can be more than annoyed, to see that he can genuinely hate and hate with such an intense passion as to kill the Borg as ruthlessly as he did was a suprise, not out of character, mind you, just something that is rarely seen. The development of Data was nice as well. Data's child like innocence seemed destroyed in this film by the disturbing Borg Queen, who was played very well. The acting in this movie is stellar, which is not abnormal for the TNG crew as thet are all great actors. And to see the sides of these characters that is so rarely seen, thier dark sides, made this movie fantastic, even if the time travel bit is getting old, especially in Trek.
