 This is the final episode staring series founder Joel Hodgeson, a sad, yet triumphant moment for the series. This episode caused an endless uproar of laughter between my friends and I; we love this one, and have deemed it a classic. While the film itself isn't as bad as some of the other MST3K episodes I've seen, like Angel's Revenge, it's certainly not worth seeing unless you're watching the MST3K version... Mitchell is an example of how funny the crew can be, and as a long time fan of the series, (I hate to say this) but how much poor Mike J. Neilson had to live up to in succeeding Joel... and how he never quite reached that level. Not only because Mitchell is one of the funniest episodes of Mystery Science Theater, but also because it's Joel's last episode, all MST3K fans need to ad this one to their collection.
