 Back in the day the SNES controler was deemed perfect, its spiritual decendant the PS controler and then the Dual shock analog control is good, but a little small for my hands. Nintendo, in thier brilliance, has designed a control for GameCube that fits my hands perfectly. Microsoft, however, seems to have taken the awkward Dreamcast controler and made it even bigger and more akward. Singlhandedly the XBox controler is the most uncomfortable controler in the histroy of console gamming. I imagine that this control would be perfect for people with huge hands, but it is literally painful for my wrists to use this (I have Carpol Tunnel Syndrom, and controlers that agrrivate it are controlers I don't like using.) Microsoft is putting out an "S" tyoe contoller that will be smaller, but that doesn't look to be much better. I know that this is MS's first outing as a console manufacturer, but controlers should never be this big, and this bad. They should stick with what works. The best controlers out ther look like modifed SNES controlers, that's true of the PS 2 controler and the GCN contoler, both which do not agrivate my wrists. Buyer be ware, the XBox controllers hurt!
