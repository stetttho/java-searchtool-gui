 Despite owning all three current consoles, and warming up slowly to XBox the Nintendo GameCube dominates my living room. Nintendo's lunchbox sized console already has a whopping twelve games in my collection (PS 2 has 8, and XBox has 4 in contrast.) GameCube also has far more games that I'm looking forward to than the other two consoles. The only real problem that Nintendo has is its lack of advertising, and its reputation for kiddy oriented games... like Mario Sunshine.   The storyline of Mario Sunshine (and title) seem as though it was intended for a four year old, but then you get into the game play which is definitely too challenging for a younger player. Mario Sunshine is the most difficult Mario game to come out in a very long time, and that makes it great! Sadly this challenging little masterpiece has a couple of problems with it. Fist of all, all of the levels are tropical themed, we don't have the multi-world set up past Marios have had, no hot lava levels, no ice worlds, etc. I also miss the Mario Karate of Mario 64, and I miss it badly. The game is a blast, and no GameCube owner should be without it, whether a kid or an adult, because both younger players and adults will appreciate it, perhaps for different reasons. Little kids may actually enjoy the story elements, while adults will appreciate this masterpiece of a challenging platformer. I still like Mario 64 better though. Hopefully the next Mario game will have the Mario Karate, and Luigi... split screen two player mode, etc.
