 Oh my God! Wow. I say that because I just played the original for the first time having been made a fan of the series after beating 2 and somewhat curious to learn more about the tie-ins with 3 after finishing it. I just can't believe how much of Silent Hill 2 and 3, built on as powerful a system as the PS2, was actually not new in regards to the PSOne original. I didn't know what to expect when I started playing this but it just blew my mind how little Konami did with the series since the original besides using sharper graphics. The sounds of the wierd air raid siren signalling the shift between worlds. The way buildings go from the foggy real world to the dark, rust-stained alternate world. The fetish with floors that turn into iron fence-like grating was actually pioneered in the original. The fact that every Silent Hill has a mandatory hospital visit with those crazy bent over nurses. Man! After playing all three it's like the pot calling the kettle black when SH fans start accusing Resident Evil of being recycled and the "same old same ol'." It actually made me a little disappointed by the franchise. Oh well, I'll always treasure the first time I beat SH2.
