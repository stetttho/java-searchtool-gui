 Although this is not a full-length album, but just an EP, there is still quite a bit of material to enjoy. The radio friendly hits "No Excuses" and "I Stay Away" are both mellow "soft" rock tunes that dominate a very mellow, acoustic album. "Rotten Apple" and "Nutshell," the first two songs on the EP immediately set the tone for the rest of the CD. A short instrumental number dubbed "Whale & Wasp" is about the only moment in the whole record where the noticeably distinct overdriven guitar tone of Jerry Cantrell's comes to light--in this case in a very melodic and moving interplay of creamy bends.  The "sleeper" hit for me on this album has to be "Don't Follow" which lyrically is about leaving people and a troubled past behind with the message being saying your good-byes to someone you know who still cares about you and doesn't want to see you go. That only leaves the closing track on this EP ("Swing on This") to offer any blissful relief albeit in a unique way that you just have to hear for yourself. Aside from Pink Floyd's 1983 album "The Final Cut," I have not heard any album flow as seemlessly from one song to another while sustaining the same energy and vibe through every song. Only because of it's short length do I not give this album 5 stars. Buy it for an "alternative" Alice in Chains sound: the Kings of Alternative Rock.
