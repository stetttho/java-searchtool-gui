 It has been a while since I last saw the original theatrical cut of this film, but I have just watched the International Version twice now and I must say it is much better. The US release is much more abbreviated and leaves out a lot of great scenes with great chemistry between the two main characters (Leon and Matilda). There is some added sexual tensions in the International Version that American viewers never got the opportunity to see in the theatres, but it is nothing vulgar or disgusting. I actually found it cute in a trite sort of way.  Another viewer posted a comment suggesting that the added footage made Leon look like a pedophile. I disagree. The Professional, or actually Leon as it was called outside the US, is less about killing than it is about a love story between two very different individuals who share several unique qualities expressed in very different ways. Both are suvivors, both are strong and independent, and both have been wronged by someone else. The majority of this version is dialogue driven and that makes it feel like there is less "in your face" action than the American version. The romance is convincing and pure. The relationship between these two characters reminded me a lot of Iris Steensma and Travis Bickle from "Taxi Driver" albeit with a much more sane performance by Jean Reno.  In one word: Spectacular! Not a classic by any means, but just enough originality and great acting to be a worthy collection on anyone's movie shelf. The only flaw to the DVD is that it lacks any commentary tracks or other special features that would have made it more of a collectible item. Otherwise, worth every cent!
