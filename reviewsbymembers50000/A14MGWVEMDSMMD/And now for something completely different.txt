 That line, taken out of context from Monty Python's Flying Circus, is what I would use to describe this album. Although it's not "completely" different, it's a whole new direction for the band which includes shifting its audience base from a rather androgynous, teenage alternative/techno/rock crowd to a very girly-pop sound. The first two tracks ("Shut Your Mouth" and "Androgyny") are pretty mild on the taste meter and are pretty reminiscent of the old Garbage. Track three, "Can't Cry These Tears," comes from absolutely nowhere and definitely would appeal more to a younger female audience. "Til The Day I Die" is so blatantly girly-pop that I can't stomach it. The same goes for track five ("Cup of Coffee"): a pathetic ballad. "Silence is Golden" along with "Drive You Home" and "So Like A Rose" all come close to the old Garbage sound as well and are my favorite tracks on this album. But the new Garbage sound: "Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!)," "Breaking Up the Girl," "Parade," "Nobody Loves You," and "Untouchable"--with its hip-hop flavor--are all very mediocre songs. Actually, "Parade" had the potential to be a big hit for them with its catchy refrain and infectious guitar hooks but was tainted by its awful verse. I guess the album is more of a mix of new elements with tried-and-true techniques. My recommendation is listen to the entire album first (not just samples) to see if you like it before you buy it.
