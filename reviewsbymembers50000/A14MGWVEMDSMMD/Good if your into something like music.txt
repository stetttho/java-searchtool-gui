 Ok, first of all I'm not really a big Radiohead fan and my affection for the band goes no further than their radio hits like "Creep" and "Karma Police." That being said, I separate myself from other reviewers in that I'm no huge Radiohead connoisseur. So when my friend bought this album and I borrowed it from him after being wooed by his total acclaim for it, I was only partially as enthusiastic. Generally speaking, the album goes absolutely nowhere. It's funny how everyone in artistic criticism circles today lay so much adulation for an album that lacks any musical merit. Tracks like "National Anthem" which start off with a weak, generic bassline and some even weaker drum programming go on for nearly two minutes of pure wasted CD and when the brass kicks in you wait in anticipation of a musical crescendo that may justify the song, only to find that the dissonance ends up sounding like a Ska band on acid. However, this is pretty much the entire quality of the album. Popular music, by its nature in being popular, will always have to have lyrical or musical hooks, some overall music structure, or just plain something. This album clearly lacks all of these and I'm still baffled why everyone loves it. I guess since nearly every band in the current music industry has pretty much "souled out," it's to be expected that the average listener will justify bad music as being artistic, especially if it's bad enough to the point where it sounds "original."
