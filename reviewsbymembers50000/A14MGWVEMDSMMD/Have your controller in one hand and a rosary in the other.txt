 I just rented this game and beat it in almost 3 nights of intense, constant playing. It's definitely the freakiest game I've ever seen and blows all other survival horror games (even RE, my personal favorite) out of the water. The only down side to an experience this intense is it's almost so evil that it really is "traumatic" to play. After you've "survived" it once and unraveled the mystery, you definitely feel an eminent sense of dread even entertaining the notion of playing the game again. Bottom line: I think the comment I made to my roommate who was watching me play the game the whole week sums it up the best: "I'd buy this game if I wasn't so afraid the box would try and kill me in my sleep!"
