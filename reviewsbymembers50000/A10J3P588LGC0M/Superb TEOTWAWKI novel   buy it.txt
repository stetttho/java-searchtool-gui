 Walter J. Williams has a fantastic story here. I grew up reading books like Niven & Pournelle's LUCIFER'S HAMMER - this book beats them. What's going to happen the next time the New Madrid fault lets loose? Who knows, but this is a thrilling rendition of Americans rising (and falling) to the occasion to deal with a near-worst case scenario.  At various points the book brought me almost to tears with joy, horrified me to where I had to stop reading for a minute (anyone else who's faced water moccasins will understand what I mean - MAN!), and had me grinning over clever HUCKLEBERRY FINN parallels. But mostly, I was just engrossed in reading, caught up in the story that pulled me along like a flooded Mississippi. I took this 932-pager out in three days' spare time, and tremendously enjoyed every minute of it. The characters were rich and wonderful, the plot development was subtle and totally believable (and sometimes horrifying), and - as always - Williams' revelation of social forces and political background are among the best I've ever read.   As others have noted, the recent disaster of Hurricane Katrina showed how accurately Mr. Williams predicted the good and bad of human behavior. Thankfully, that disaster was not of the scale envisioned in THE RIFT, so things never got as out of hand as they did in the book . . . but wow, did he call it!  Superb book!
