 The phenomenal DREAD EMPIRE'S FALL series (THE PRAXIS, THE SUNDERING, and CONVENTIONS OF WAR) constitute the best space opera that it has ever been my pleasure to read in the 30+ years I've been reading it. Better than the Pournelle/Niven GOD'S EYE stuff, better than . . . well, I could go on and on. Walter Jon Williams packs these books with the most page-turningly marvelous story, incorporating alien species and psychologies, space battles, meaningful growing characters, loathsome self-interested politics, hilarity, ground war adventure and - believe it or not - genuinely aching romance. All roughly based on the Roman Civil Wars, apparently. What a universe Williams has created - the man is a genius! A friend loaned me the first book of the series, and I read it overnight. I then went out the next day and bought all three books. One day per book - I've been unable to put them down. I would recommend these for any science fiction fan, and have already bought a copy of the first book as a gift for a friend. Now that I'm finished with this thrilling trilogy, I wish there were more of it. I sincerely hope that HarperCollins has the good sense to order a follow-up trilogy to continue the stories of these superb characters. As it is, I'm going to be seeking out more of Williams' work!
