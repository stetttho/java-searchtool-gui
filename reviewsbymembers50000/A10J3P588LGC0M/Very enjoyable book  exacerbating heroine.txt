 I've wanted to check out something by Turtledove (the model for the Ian Arnstein character in Stirling's excellent Nantucket-out-of-time series) for some time now, but I haven't really felt up to reading any more in the alternate US history genre just yet (Too much Draka will do that to you). I bought Household Gods, but was skeptical about how much I'd enjoy it as a fan of Roman history. No worries: I opened the book on a Tuesday morning and then spent virtually every free minute I had reading the 664-pager, until I finished it on the commute to work that Thursday a.m. I very much enjoyed this work.  I agree with many of the other reviewers that Nicole Gunther-Perrin, the protagonist, is initially annoying as all get-out. Very real, too: competent but whiney, with a touch of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. I've certainly run into folks just like her in the legal profession. (And somebody wrote Nicole's Hoosier cultural history very well!) The writers do a fine job, allowing the reader to be annoyed with the main character but enthralled by the story and the historical setting. And, lo and behold, the protagonist evolves! The result is a denouement most enjoyable.  This isn't much of a review, but there are so many others that I mostly just wanted to voice my approval. I will certainly read more Turtledove, and - here's the surprise for me - more Tarr as well.
