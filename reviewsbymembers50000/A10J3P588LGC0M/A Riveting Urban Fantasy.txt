 I don't even like fantasy, but I couldn't put this one down. Legends Walking, Jane Lindskold's latest "urban fantasy" picks up the quasi-immortal "Athanor" characters she introduced in Changer and sets them loose in wide-ranging adventures that kept my nose planted in the  400-page book until I finished it. The story lines were exciting and the  character development was wonderful, at times unexpected, and wholly  satisfying. As usual, Lindskold's sense of humor is apparent throughout the  book (although perhaps not as bluntly displayed as it was in the closet  scene of Lord Demon, her recently released collaboration with Zelazny),  bringing an additional level of enjoyment to a good yarn well-told. I've  really come to enjoy this author, and I hope Avon realizes what a winner it  has with the Athanor novels.
