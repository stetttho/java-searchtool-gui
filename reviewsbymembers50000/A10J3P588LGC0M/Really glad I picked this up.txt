 I picked this off the library shelf yesterday because a reviewer was described it on the cover as having a protagonist similar to Heinlein's juveniles. Wow, I was not disappointed! Tor's got another hot one. Gerrold  does a wonderful job of describing the tribulations of a kid in a  dysfunctional family, and he does one of the best jobs I've seen of  focusing on the kinds of things a kid would notice. Jumping Off the Planet  is a delightful (but much more psychologically and sociologically complex)  heir to classical SF with juvenile protagonists.    The plot of Jumping  Off the Planet is fast-paced and exciting enough (harrowing at times!) to  keep me reading last night until I finished it. Which sort of surprises me  in retrospect, since the scale of the novel is not particularly huge:  basically, it just gets the protagonist up a beanstalk and into space. But  so much happens on this futuristic road trip/elevator ride on that I was  quite satisfied with the novel. Well, maybe not totally satisfied - having  finished the book, I want more. Right now! (I've got a feeling I'm going to  enjoy this trilogy.)    Gerrold handles difficult subjects like race and  sexuality deftly. His main characters are complex and interesting, and he  develops them artfully throughout the book. I didn't want to stop reading  because I couldn't wait to find out what happened to them next. The  economics, politics, law and science in the novel's background seem  plausible and are well thought-out.   The fairly-near-future world of  Jumping Off the Planet is familiar enough to seem like home, and possible  enough to be frightening. The characters are well done, and the plot is  riveting. I'll be returning this book to the library and buying my own  copy. And when the sequels come out, I'll have them pre-ordered here on  Amazon. What an excellent book!
