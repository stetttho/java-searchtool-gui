 Mr. Kahl's review is dead-on in that this riveting book starts off as an excellent novel about the mundane world, and the reader is almost startled by the gradual appearance of the fantastic in the superb story. In this respect, the storytelling in this terrific book reminded me (in the best possible way) of Stephen King's better stuff. Ms. Lindskold certainly develops the history of her lead character in the mundane world much more than does, say, Charles DeLint (in anything of his that I've read - not to run him down in any way) - the book has a richness of character detail that reminds me of the best of Amy Tan's writings.   Ah, but when the fantastic starts to become revealed, the pace is perfect and the mystery draws one on and on. This was another book that was excruciatingly difficult to put down at bedtime - I managed only when I became so tired that my eyes could no longer focus on the words. (And then I promptly finished it upon picking it up the next morning.) I found the story to be delightful and satisfying, a real treat that I'm looking forward to sharing with friends.  Other reviewers have discussed the storyline in plenty of detail, so I'll stick to these short compliments about Ms. Lindskold's writing. I loved, Loved, LOVED this book!
