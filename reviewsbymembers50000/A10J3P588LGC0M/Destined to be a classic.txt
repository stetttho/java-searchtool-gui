 My wife just gave me a copy of Percussion Pistols and Revolvers for my birthday, and I found myself reading it straight through - what a fabulous present!  Messrs. Cumpston and Bates really come through in their thorough, terrific book on percussion pistols and revolvers, with some of the best gun writing that has ever been my pleasure to read. Full of straightforward and brutally honest reviews of every major variant of percussion pistol, this book delighted me with unlooked-for nuggets of wonderful and fascinating historical info (one appendix is an entire dueling code!) and laugh-out-loud humor. Bates and Cumpston use plentiful detailed photographs and charts to supplement their rich but practical text on percussion handgun history, development, shooting, loads, chronography and hunting.   I can't stress enough the enjoyment this book will provide any firearms enthusiast - I plan on buying a couple more copies to give to friends as Christmas gifts. I would give this six stars if I could!
