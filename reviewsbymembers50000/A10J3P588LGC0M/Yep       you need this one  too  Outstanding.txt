 I want to apologize for what's going to be a short review, but I want to get back to this terrific book.  I've been a big fan of John Taffin's writing for years now. No other gunwriter carries the banner of classic gunwriting the way he does. I've owned BIG BORE HANDGUNS and BIG BORE SIXGUNS for some time now, and I've had the good fortune to meet Mr. Taffin online at the Sixgunner.com forums. These two were among my favorite books - I could always pick them up and open them at random and just lose myself in the great writing and photographs. But when this book (SINGLE ACTION SIXGUNS) was announced, I was skeptical - what else could JT even SAY on the subject?  Well, a lot, it turns out. And Mr. Taffin doesn't just repeat himself from the other books or from his Guns/American Handgunner articles. This is new stuff, with new photos (TONS of them - better than ever, and in ALL color). There are 336 pages of great info (and COLOR photos - excellent, sharp photos) on all sorts of things, ranging from old original models to modern single-action sixguns, to mini-SAs, to replicas, customs, grips, tips, hunting, leather and - of course - John's ongoing search for the perfect packing gun. This is John Taffin's best book so far!  Now, please bear in mind that I'm not all that huge a single-action revolver fan. I've owned a few (only have one right now), but I'm MUCH more into double-action revos and even semiautomatics. This book, though, has completely captivated me. I'm so glad I bought it (and, by the way, Amazon has a great price compared to what I've seen at the local bookstore).   If you're a gun guy or you're thinking about buying a gift for one, look no further and BUY THIS GREAT BOOK!
