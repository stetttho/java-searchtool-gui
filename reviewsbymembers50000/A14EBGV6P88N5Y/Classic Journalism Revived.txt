 Gary Delsohn proves himself as an outstanding journalist in the classic sense with this book.  He captures the essense of the cases but more importantly, the thoughts and feelings of the women and men who tirelessly work to uphold justice in our communities.  This is an excellent book that puts a very human face on the large and seemingly inhumane criminal justice system.
