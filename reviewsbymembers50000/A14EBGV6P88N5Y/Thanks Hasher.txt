 My good friend Dean Kaplan, who is a hasher through and through bought me this book for my birthday. I had never heard of this author before but I trusted Dean, who is really smart and man pretty. So I read the book and was amazed. Hiaasen is a great author. I don't know why his name is so hard to spell...I mean...what's with the exta "a"? But he's an author so I guess he knows what is best and I should not question him. Go you huskies!
