 People who liked this movie...well...they need help.  The soundtrack was utterly tragic.  The music in the movie was great but the good stuff does not appear on the soundtrack...and they ruined it with disgusting dialogue from the film.  If they produce a score from the movie without the dialogue it would be worth buying.  Save your money.
