 Normally I wouldn't advocate a product just because it has a cool sounding name but I make an exception for Oxo.  It almost sounds like "oxygen" which we all need to live so maybe that's why I find it so attractive.  At any rate, I'm buying all the Oxo stuff I can.  This item is great because you can read it from above.  That would be good for airborne rangers since they are always arriving from helicopters on fast ropes.  I saw that in a movie.
