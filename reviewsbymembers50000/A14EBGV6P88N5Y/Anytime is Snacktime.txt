 I love this little grill.  Not only is it cute as a button but it fits nicely in the passenger seat of my car.  I can cruise up and down main street eating freshly grilled burgers and sausage.  A hot coal fell on the floor and my car burned up but not before I saved my grill!  Now I'm shopping for a new car...maybe one made of something that doesn't burn like water.  Then my grill and I will be back on the road together.  Where we belong.
