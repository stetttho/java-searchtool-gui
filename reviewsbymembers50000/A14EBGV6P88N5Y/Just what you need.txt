 I haven't actually seen this calendar but if it is anything like the other calendars I have seen it will contain page after page of boxes with dates.  You can write in these boxes to indicate important events such as "Jacobim's Birthday" or "Smooth's Eye Surgury".  Also you can use the boxes to remind yourself of important things that you have to do such as "Pay the Rent" or "Don't Forget the Safety Word!" Each page has a month of boxes so you will never forget anything again!  Plus you get pictures of Shakira and she has a nice voice.
