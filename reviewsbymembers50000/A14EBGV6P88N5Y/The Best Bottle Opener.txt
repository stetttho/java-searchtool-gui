 Finally a bottle opener that isn't afraid of any bottle!  A big thanks to the aliens who brought us technology like this Bottle Opener...which doubles as a personal defense weapon.  I wear mine around my neck wherever I go so I'm ready to open any bottle in path as well as knock out potential muggers.  Hooray for Rubbermaid!
