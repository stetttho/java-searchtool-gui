 Nothing will make you feel like a rock star like this Leatherman Wave.  I wear it on my belt and feel ten feet tall.  I'm telling you..just knowing you have the right tool for any occassion is enough for the average Joe.  I don't think I could build a house with it but I'd sure give it a try.  I use it to open bottles sometimes and it makes me look really cool.  Can you dig it?
