 I didn't like this movie at all.  That doesn't mean that you won't though.  I don't know you or what you like.  Maybe you like the kinds of movies I like and maybe not.  So really it's all up to what you like and not what I like.  But if you are a friend of mine you probably won't like it because I only pick friends who like the same movies as I do.  So if you know me and are my friend then I would say you wouldn't like this movie.  Or maybe you will which just shows you that I don't know you at all.  I think we can still be friends though.
