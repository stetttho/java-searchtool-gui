 I'm a huge Forsyth fan...his writing is usually second to none and his thrillers are real page turners.  It had been awhile since he wrote anything so I was elated to see this book hit the stands.  Unfortunately it was a big disappointment.  The writing was tired and the stories very predictable.  It was not at all his usually quality of work.  Either he unearthed a selections of short stories from when he was just learning to write or he needed money badly and vomited out this drivel.  I pray his next effort is better.  I remain a devoted fan but warn the reader that this book is sub-par.
