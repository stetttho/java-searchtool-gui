 I'm in the Amsterdam airport right now.  The announcements over the loudspeaker for gate changes and such are all in Dutch...which is very scary because I don't speak it.  If you plan to spend some time in the Amsterdam airport you should get this book first.  Granted, they make the announcements in English eventually but the first burst of Dutch sure can scare a guy.  Save yourself the pain and grab this book first.  Oh...they are talking in Thai now...better buy that one too.
