 I was fixing to do some mixing in my kitchen one day.  I grabbed this bowl, tossed in some ingredients and went to town.  I mixed for days and days without ceasing...why?  Its not becuase I'm a crazed lunatic who likes to do the man dance on the rooftop...no...its because this bowl was magical.  It made me sing while I mixed.  I sang songs of mixing.  Sweet, tender yet robust songs.  I'll make an album of my mixing songs.  Look for me on TV soon.  Mixing and singing.
