 If you are looking for something that will hold a lot of CD's...like say 264 of them then this is the gizmo you need.  It is good for CD's or even DVD's...but does not work very well for storing monkeys.  The little guys keep crawling out when I'm not looking and then when one of the them finds the keys to the car...look out!  But seriously, the monkeys should be free I guess but you try to manage 264 monkeys running around your house!  Shizam!
