 This book is a most honorable effort to introduce the unknown peoples of the Highlands.  It is extremely well orgainzed, beautifully written, and full of information and suprises.  My hat is off to the author for taking on this most important and daunting project.  I highly reccommend this book to anyone with an interest in people and culture.
