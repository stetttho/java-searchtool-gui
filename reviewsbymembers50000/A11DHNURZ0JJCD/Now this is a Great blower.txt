 I LOVE this thing.  It works GREAT.  The blower is powerful, and I have had no problem with the vacuum.  Going out to the garage to get my blower is so exciting.  I lose track of time blowing the dirt and leaves out of my driveway.  Today I even picked up all the garbage in the street with my vacuum.  I was surprised how heavy the bag gets with the leaves, dirt,etc, but all you have to do it empty and pop it back on.  Very easy to change from blower to vac, and back again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
