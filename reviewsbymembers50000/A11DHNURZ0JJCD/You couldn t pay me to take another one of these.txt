 This toy is such a piece of junk!!!  My daughter received it for her birthday and played with it for five minutes before it broke.  The hands do not stay snapped in, the doll just falls.  It's a hard doll, made of plastic, so she doesn't even want to play with it like a regular doll. I unfortunately threw out the box, or it would have been returned.
