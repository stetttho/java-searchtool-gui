 This is by far the largest of the power wheels.  It is great fun, however the hood is constantly coming undone.  That seems to be the only problem.  The hood just pops off on bumps or whenever it feels like it.  I push it back in but it won't stay sealed.  Other than that this is the best toy I think any kid could ever get.  My daughter (4) loves it!
