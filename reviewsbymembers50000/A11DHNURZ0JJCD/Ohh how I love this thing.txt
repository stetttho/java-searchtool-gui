 I don't know how I lived without this powerful little vac. I have to constantly clean up spills of cereal, crumbs, raisins, etc. This vac is very powerful and runs a million circles around my lame Shark hand vac.  The attachment is great for getting those yucky crumbs out of the corners of the van too.  This is one of the best purchases I have ever made, I love it!
