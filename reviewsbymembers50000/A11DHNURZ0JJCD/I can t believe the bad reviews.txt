 This is a great Wiggles movie.  The songs are addictive, there is a lot of information about Australia and it's animals, and it has that cutie Steve Irwin.  My daughter was a Wiggles fan, but now she is a true fanatic.  She has watched this dvd every day since I bought it.  I watch it also, I can't help myself.  The tunes are so catchy.  My seventeen month old son even boogies in front of the television.   There is a lot of very interesting stuff on koalas, emus, kookaburras(not sure how to spell that one), cockatoos,and dingos.   I can't help myself, I just love those guys, especially Greg. If you don't like it the first time, keep watching, you'll get addicted too!
