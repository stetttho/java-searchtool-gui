 Bought this for my son right after birth.  At 18 months he still loves it.  It is the only mirror with lights and songs that attaches to the crib.  Only one problem, if you push the switch all the way over it will continuously play music for what seems like forever.  This is only a problem for parents with a monitor on.  If any part of my son's body touches the wheel while he is asleep the music wakes me up and keeps me up until it ends. Keep the switch on for a single song or turn off the monitor!
