 My daughter received this last year for x mas.  I didn't realize the coloring books cost ...  She finished the first book in two days and then I had to go out to buy a new coloring book.  By the time I came home with the Winnie the Pooh coloring book (which is very cute, but not at all worth [the money]), my daughter was already finished with the excitement of the whole thing.  Also, the frame broke after about a month.  It still works, but I don't think it should have broken.      The train plate is cute, but only tells the numbers and says a few things.  That wasn't ever used again either.    One more thing...The toy is extremely large and difficult to store.  I really do prefer a nice regular coloring book, and a box of crayons, and so does my daughter.
