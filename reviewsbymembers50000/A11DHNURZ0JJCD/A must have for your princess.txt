 We all just love this game.  My daughter begs to play it every night.  It is a lot of fun, and little girls look so cute with the jewelry on.  I really don't mind playing this at all.  A lot of the preschool games are close to torture.   There is really only one problem.  I have found little girls DO NOT like to lose.  Sometimes I have to take three or four spins in a row to make sure I lose.  Breaks my heart to see those losing tears when I win. Buy this game you will not be sorry.
