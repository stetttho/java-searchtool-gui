 If I had to name the one product that made my life easier it would be this one.  My son was happy and comfortable in this carrier from four days old until about 9 months.  I used this every day from taking walks to going to the supermarket to making dinner.  It is easy to get on and off, the child can face in or out, and it is comfortable on the back.
