 No on/off switch, no control over the music it plays, goes off if you walk too close to it.  This was in the trunk for a while getting ready to be returned (we had almost all of the sparkling symphony items already).  I decided to give it a shot.  Boy was I sorry.  I don't understand why Fisher Price doesn't make it more like a regular piano.  This and the Sparkling Symphony xylophone have minds of their own.  I don't think either of my children ever even touched this one more than once. In a bag in the attic.  Do you want it?
