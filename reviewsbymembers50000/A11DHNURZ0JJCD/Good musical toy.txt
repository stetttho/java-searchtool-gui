 Having a toy box filled with BAD musical toys (sparkling symphony), it is nice to have a different type of instrument.  My daughter likes playing the violin with the bow.  The guitar is almost the same as the other electronic guitars filling the toy box.  I wouldn't say it's a MUST have, but it does introduce the violin and might spark a child's interest in classical music or violin lessons.
