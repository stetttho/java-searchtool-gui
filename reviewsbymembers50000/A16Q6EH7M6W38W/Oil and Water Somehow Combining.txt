 Imagine Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan hanging out one night.  They run into the Clash, who just left a bar where Neil Young broke up a fight between John Mellencamp (going by the "Cougar" alias) and Johnny Rotten.   They all kiss and make-up and decide to make some music  together.... That's how I would describe "Still Feel Gone".   It's an odd mix of styles and genres, but it flows with an awesome  cohesiveness that is rock and country and punk and folk, without being any  one style alone.  Buy this CD.
