 With this album Van Morrison is one of the few artists who can duplicate his own songs live without repeating them.  In other words, he's able to invoke that same Celtic soul without merely duplicating his studio versions.  I guess you have to hear it to understand it, but this is a truly worth while live offering that brings uniqueness to the songs we love so much.
