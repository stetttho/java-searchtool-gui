 I can't think of another recording that is an amalgam of American music...it fuses rock with country, folk with rock, and the spirit to keep it all alive and then some.  This is THE greatest road album I have ever  heard.  Jay Farrar and Son Volt create a musical painting of the American  vision in past and present, with the sweetness and sadness that every man,  woman, and child will endure in this life.  A classic.
