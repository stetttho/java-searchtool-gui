 This album is a masterpiece!   Flooded with emotions, this recording paints such a picture of darkness, pain, and frustrations that come with the most overused word in any song....'love'.  Nick Cave pulls no punches,  and delivers with a drop-kick to the soul.  This is not a CD to listen to  in the daylight.  Turn the lights out, light a candle, and let it in....you  won't be sorry.
