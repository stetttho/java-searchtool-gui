 Nick Cave comes full circle with this album.  Only a casual fan,I thought he had hit his pinnacle with "Let Love In" in '94.  However, he takes the all-consuming extremes that made "Let Love In" and  "Murder Ballads" the unique offerings they were one step  further...he never quite achieves reconciliation, but he offers some hint  of acceptance.  If you are a fan of music that is wrought of pure emotion,  hear this album.
