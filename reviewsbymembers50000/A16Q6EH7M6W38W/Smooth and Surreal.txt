 This is truly an original band.  Combining influences of lounge music, psychedelic undertones, sultry vocals, and occasional sleek riffs, the Januaries truly have a unique sound and have created a unique album.  Vocalist Debbie Diamond succeeds with her voice where many have failed ...her singing has a charisma that is subtley provocative without coming across as trashy, no gimmicks necessary. The horns are well-placed and smooth, blending perfectly with the sleek guitar riffs and keyboards to create a layered multi-textured sound.  This is accomplished without sounding over-produced.  These songs give a nod to Burt Bacharach, early Pink Floyd, the dreaminess of Julee Cruise (singer from the Twin Peaks soundtrack), and an occasional Smash Mouth-like riff.  It sounds like a strange combination, but does it ever work!  There is a good mix of more driving rocking songs ("Juliette", "Angel Eye", "Summer of Love") and sexy mellow numbers ("Chocolate and Strawberries", "All Systems a GoGo", "The Girl's Insane") to satisfy both appetites and everything inbetween.  By combining many familiar sounds and adding their own unique touch, the Januaries have succeeded in creating something totally different.  Listen to it at night.  A great CD!!!
