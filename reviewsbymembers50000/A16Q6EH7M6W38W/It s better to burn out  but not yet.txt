 This is a long awaited album, and it was worth the wait.  Neil taps the vein of "After the Goldrush" and "Harvest", but with a wisdom that only time can bring.  The songs are at times simplistic, but  that's the beauty of them, they are stripped down and real.  I have a  bootleg version of "Razor Love" from '87, and it's better than  this version, but overall the album is in my opinion much stronger than  "Harvest Moon".  It would be interesting to hear the album with  the four songs CSN snatched to keep their album from completely sinking....
