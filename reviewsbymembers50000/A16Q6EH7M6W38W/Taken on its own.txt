 I can't speak for anyone else, but I truly enjoy this CD.  I've been lucky enough to ride Ryan's artistic rollercoaster since I saw him with Whiskeytown in 1997 when I was in school.  I've seen him solo in a bar and with a band in a sold out theater, and its been exciting and enjoyable in all cases. Frankly, I think he is comparable to Neil Young in that he goes where the music and his muse takes him.  Sometimes folks don't like where he takes them.  If he kept releasing the same music, it would be boring and predictable.   Taken on its own, I think Rock N Roll is a strong effort.  Forget the press, forget whatever was said in interviews, forget what his last release sounded like...Rock N Roll has some great hooks, memorable lines, and came across to me as a passionate release.  I look forward to wherever Ryan Adams takes me next, and I welcome it... Mike Sobota Chicago, IL
