 Wow...I wasn't sure what to expect from this CD.  I really like  Whiskeytown, but I was hoping that this would offer something different to  that sound.  I was not disappointed despite my skeptism.  This is clearly  NOT a Whiskeytown album, but it may certainly appeal to the Whiskeytown  fans.  Sparse at times, this album gave me the feel of a small town kid's  innocense being forced to come to terms with life in a city, which can be  merciless.  "Oh My Sweet Carolina" is a prime example of this  innocense lost, but not forgotten.  "My Winding Wheel" is a  stand-out cut and one of my personal favorites.  The instrumentation is  somewhat sparse, but it highlights both the lyrical content and Ryan Adam's  persona. If you are a fan of Dylan's "Blood on the Tracks" or  Neil Young's "On the Beach", this will appeal to you, even if  it's unrealistic to compare this one to those classics.  Ryan Adams is a  truly undiscovered talent, and it's a crime that he is not a rich man, both  from this album and his work with Whiskeytown, one of the best American  bands out there.  Give it a listen.
