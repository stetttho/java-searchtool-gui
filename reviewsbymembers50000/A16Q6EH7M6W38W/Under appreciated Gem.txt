 This is by far one of my favorite albums by Van, and in my opinion, one of the most underrated.  A distinct combination of the lyrical stream-of-consciousness of "Astral Weeks" and the jazz/soul/pop of "Moondance" and "His Band and Street Choir", this album offers a combination of the best of these earlier offerings.  Tracks like "Listen to the Lion", "Almost Independence Day" and the title track invoke that same introspective spirit as "Astral Weeks", while "Redwood Tree" and "Jackie Wilson Said" are more fun and body-moving.  This is a masterpiece of these varying styles and one of the best albums of Van's, as well as the early '70s.  Worth the price and then some.
