 I've been a big TVZ fan now for a few years, stumbling on him thanks to Steve Earle and Son Volt.  Luckily, I've been able to get copies of most of his albums since they've recently come back in print.  "Live at the  Old Quarter" was the last one I needed to complete my library, and the  best truly was saved for last.  This set captures Townes at his pinnacle.   Unlike other available live offerings, this is all Townes and Townes as he  was best...alone.  One gets a better impression of TVZ the guitarist as  well as the singer.  The only downfall of this set is that he didn't play  every one of his songs.  Notably absent is "I'll Be Here in the  Morning" and "Our Mother the Mountain".  If you are a TVZ  fan, you need this album.
