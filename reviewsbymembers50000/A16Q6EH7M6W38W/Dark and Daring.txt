 This is an incredible album by a band that had all the right tools at the wrong time.  "Love" has an edgier, more rocking sound than "Dreamtime", but it taps the same vain of gothic psychedelia.   They weren't the Bauhaus, they weren't the Cure, they were the Cult, and  the could rock and still be dark.  An odd combination of The Doors meeting  Led Zeppelin.  If the opening riff to "Love" or "She Sells  Sanctuary" doesn't get your juices flowing, then nothing will.  An  essential...You won't be dissapointed.
