 Well, if you are expecting a parallel to the Bogart movie, you are looking in the wrong place.  This book is an examination of the human character, and how the human spirit can become warped in extreme circumstances.  At once a commentary and a warning, I found the harshness of the story a contrast to blind optimism.  Worth the read.
