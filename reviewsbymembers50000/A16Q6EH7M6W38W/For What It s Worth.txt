 In my honest opinion there are some harsh reviews of this CD.  Once you look at this release without history and let it stand alone, its true strength emerges.  Yes, Paul Westerberg was the front-man of the  Replacements; yes, they rocked; yes they were alternative before such a  term existed.  However, Paul Westerberg has matured as an artist.   Content-wise, this recording is a strange cross-breed between Eric  Clapton's "Layla" and Neil Young's "Harvest".  The  songs are sparsely arranged, and have some obviously deeper meaning in  terms of relationships.  Sure, it's not "Let It Be" or  "Pleased to Meet Me", but you surely can't expect the guy to  mimic himself, right?  "Suicaine Gratification" is a powerful CD  if you listen to it without pre-conceived notions or prejudice.  Check it  out with an open mind....
