 This CD is fantastic.  I had heard Nick's name dropped by other artists such as Lucinda Williams.  My curiosity got the best of me, and I picked up this CD.  This is proof positive that impulse buys can lead to great  discovery.  The music on this CD is incredible.  Haunting dirges that best  be listened to at night.  I had to smile when I heard 'Pink Moon' on a car  commercial.  I went out and got the box set after this, but it's a great  place to start.
