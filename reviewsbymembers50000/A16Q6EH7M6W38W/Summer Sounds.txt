 Like many fans, I bought this CD because I am a Sublime fan.  Though this is not a Sublime album, it is a fantastic recording that stands strongly on its own.  I'm stuck in Chicago and this brought me the perfect escape for  my first winter here.  I was ready to load up my now dormant surfboard and  head for the coast.  That's some powerful music.
