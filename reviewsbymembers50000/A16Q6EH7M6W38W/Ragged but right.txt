 This is a classic album that is essential to any true rock music fan.  At times sparse and wrought with emotion, "Tonight's the Night" marks a dark period in the career of Neil Young.  Dealing with the drug  deaths of two friends, commercial success that attempted to pigeon-hole him  as the guy who sings "Heart of Gold", and throat complications,  this album, released two years after it was recorded, is the climax (and  chronologically part II) of a trilogy.  In this trilogy, Neil makes a raw  statement, essentially thumbing his nose at commercial influences,  accessibility, and success, and takes the listener on a journey into  darkness.  The other two installments ('73's "Time Fades Away"  and '74's "On the Beach) are still unreleased on CD and masterpieces  as well.  When placed in it's context, "Tonight's the Night" is a  shot of musical tequila in the gut chased with a beer and a tear.  In some  ways this is the first punk record.  If only Neil would finally release the  other two parts to this dark trilogy...
