 Like many of the reviews here, I first heard Rose by seeing her perform live in Chicago.  I was very moved by her performance and picked up this recording after the show.  Rarely does a recording capture a performer's  artistry and charisma on disc.  This is a wonderful exception to that  unfortunate trend.  Rose's lyrics are mysterious and often intriguingly  ambiguous.  This is not fluffy hold-my-hand-and-walk-in-a-field folk any  more than it is Top 40 Jewel-esque pop .  This is musical poetry at its  most creative, with more of a nod towards the Doors than to Fairport  Convention. She delivers her introspection in a breathy sultry voice that  carries the fragilty of Nick Drake coupled with the pure emotional force of  Eddie Vedder.   All of the tracks are acoustic, a few have Rose's guitar  coupled with a mournful fiddle.  "Abalin" gives me chills upon  every listen.   I highly recommend this CD, particularly to fans of Nick  Drake, mid-70s Neil Young, vintage Joni Mitchell, and even the Smashing  Pumpkins.  In a time when so much great music goes unheard, take a chance  with this one.  You won't be disappointed.
