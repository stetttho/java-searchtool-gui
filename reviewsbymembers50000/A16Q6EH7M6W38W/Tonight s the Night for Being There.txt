 "Tonight's the Night" for the '90s...not as desolate, not nearly as drunk, but at times just as dark.  This album is a fantastic achievement in rock music because Tweedy is just as happy to cast a glance backward as  he is to progress the band's sound into the future.  It's got roots and  soul.  It can bring you down "The Lonely 1", or it can get you  rockin' "Kingpin", but one thing it won't do is disappoint!
