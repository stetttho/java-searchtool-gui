 With "Stranger's Almanac", Whiskeytown has produced some of the greatest rock 'n' roll in the last fifteen years (and "16 Days").  It's unfortunate that they have been lumped into a group of bands that  tried to springboard off of the success of Uncle Tupelo and it's children,  Son Volt and Wilco.  Whiskeytown are not rip-offs or bandwagon'ers.  Their  sound is unique, and Ryan Adams can dazzle you with lyrics that are simple  yet so deep.  This is an incredible album well worth its bargain price.  I  liken these guys to Neil Young in many ways.  Can't go wrong....
