 I think Jay Farrar is an incredible artist.  upon first listen, I was somewhat disappointed with this release.  I was hoping for TRACE II I guess.  After several more listens, a few of the songs grew on me, then a  few more, and now I think it's a classic.  The moody undertones of the  songs thanks to some dropped tuning and Farrar's plaintive voice, convey a  message of sweet sadness that transcends to total darkness in the tracks 8  and 10.  A solid effort.
