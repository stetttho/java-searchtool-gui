 Although I started listening to Nick a few years ago courtesy of Lucinda Williams dropping his name, I must say that though Nick was a nice secret for us to enjoy, the VW commercial would be nothing without that song.  I  know many people who are in love with the commercial thanks to Nick's song.   That being said, the commercial doesn't spoil his music, his music blesses  the commercial.
