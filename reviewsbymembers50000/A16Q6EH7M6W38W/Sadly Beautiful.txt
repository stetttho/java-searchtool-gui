 This album is darkly gorgeous.  It is a perfect album for a strung-out night or a rainy day.  At times bleak, sometimes slightly uplifting, it's dense with emotion in a way that many releases lack these days.  This is  kind of a '90s version of Neil Young's '74 release "On the  Beach", which only the truly fortunate have ever even heard....If you  like deep dark music ala Nick Cave's "The Boatman's Call", you  will not be disappointed.
