 This CD has it all...the perfect soundtrack for a summer weekend.  It mixes punk with ska, reggae with folk, and elements of hip-hop to boot...and somehow it all works.  Bradley Nowell had a special talent that  could make all his influences come together in a cohesive manner.  This CD  is packed full of music (21 tracks)!   Truly a masterpiece that is  somewhat overlooked.  From the opening sample and bass of "Waiting for  my Ruca" to the 12-string strains of the cover "Rivers of  Babylon", this CD packs a soulful funky kick that never gets old.   Check it out.
