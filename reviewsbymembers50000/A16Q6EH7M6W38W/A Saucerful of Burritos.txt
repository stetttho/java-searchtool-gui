 I have found this to be a timeless album that I return to again and again, never growing tired of it.  It defies any simple categorization, and it is limiting to call this "alt-country" music.  "Once We Were Trees" has more in common with Pink Floyd cerca '69 than it does with the alt-country bands like Son Volt and the Jayhawks, or the country rock of the '70s SoCal scene.  The steel guitars are sweeping and sound like they originated from outer space, the organ textures are occasionally spooky, and the harmonies are everywhere.  There are also guitar noise explorations that remind you we aren't in Kansas anymore.  From the opening notes of "Germination", I knew that this was something different, something that sounded timeless but not dated, a perfect extention from the past into the present and on into the future.    As the years have passed since I first purchased this album, it has continued to grow on me, and is now one of my all-time favorites.  There are tones of darkness everywhere (some have referred to it as "murkiness"), but they are tempered with both the harmonies in the arrangements, as well as the lyricical message that leave this listener with a feeling of comfort and hope.    I encourage you to give it more than one listen.  I would be shocked if it didn't grow on you with a little time.
