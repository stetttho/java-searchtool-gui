 I hadn't listened to this album in almost 7 years....not sure what  possessed me to pop it in my player, but I'm glad I did...This is one of  the finest expressions of yearning, searching, and discontent I have ever  heard.  A true soundtrack to the soul-searcher.  From the opening  church-like strains of organ on "Where the Streets Have no Name"  to the final tones of "Mothers of the Disappeared", all the songs  have strike a chord in the heart of a seeker.  It is much more  contemplative than the pop singles it produced, and those singles strike  harder and more to the heart when heard in the context of the entire album.   It truly captures the feeling of unrest that exists and festers in many of  us in the search for meaning and something better.  "A+" many  years after its release....
