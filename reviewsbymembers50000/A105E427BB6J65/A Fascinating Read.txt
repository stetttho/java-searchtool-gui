 For those of you who are intrigued by the political machine and the inner workings of Washington D.C., this book will not disappoint.  Baker gives an exhaustive, balanced, and readable account of the actual impeachment process.  It was a bit nauseating to know that partisan politics are more important to our country's "leaders" than doing the right thing and taking the high road, regardless of the outcome.  It may be time for another political party to arise and it's past time for the American people to arise and make their elected officials accountable for their actions.  Very well researched,...  Everyone should read this book--regardless of their political affliation.
