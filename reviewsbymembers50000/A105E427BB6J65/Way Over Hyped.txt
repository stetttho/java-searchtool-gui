 Keppel has a hard time telling this story. In fact, I'm not too sure what story he's telling.  Is this a story about Bundy, about the Green River Killer, or about Keppel.  On all fronts, it falls far short, is very fragmented and hard to follow.  Worst of all, it left me unsatisfied--I still don't know anymore about Ted Bundy than when I first started the book.  I would hardly say that Bundy reveals his secrets in this book. I would say instead, that Bundy takes Keppel on a boring self-absorbed ride through his own speculations about getting into the mind of the Green River Killer.  What you do see is Ted Bundy as a bloated pontificator of the worst kind!  Keppel fails to get from Bundy what he promises and as a result I feel the book did not deliver! Save your money, there are better true crime novels about Bundy than this--I hope!
