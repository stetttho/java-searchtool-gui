 Jeannette Walls relays a mesmerizing tale of her childhood that astonished and enveloped me in her life like few memoirs I've read.  This book opened my eyes to another side of homelessness.  Yes, I realize that many homeless people are alcoholics or drug addicts, but what I discovered about the parents is that homelessness for them was a choice, in fact, an adventure--if you can believe her mother's assessment. Her father may not have been able to rise about his situation without help, but her mother chose to live this lifestyle.  This should be an eye-opener for some of the liberals who blame homelessness on everyone but the homeless.  This book proves otherwise.  It may be an isolated situation, but I have my doubts.    Bravo to Jeannette for overcoming her upbringing to become a contributing member of society and having the courage to finally confront her past through this novel. I hope this journey was cathartic for her.    I would like to see her write more novels.  She has a real talent and an obviously compassionate nature.  I would like to know more about her experiences once she got to New York.  I'm certain there's a second book in there somewhere. Kudos to her husband for his encouragement, compassion, and understanding.
