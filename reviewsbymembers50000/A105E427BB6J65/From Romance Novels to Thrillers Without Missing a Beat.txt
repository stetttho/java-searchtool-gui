 For a first time mystery/thriller writer, Anne Frasier hit the mark!  I especially enjoyed the realistic character development that occurs throughout the book and I enjoyed the way the book ended.  I know there will likely be a sequel, but even if there isn't one, I appreciate the fact that Frasier did not feel compelled to wrap the ending into a tidy bow.  She didn't need to go off into a romantic ending nor make everything end perfectly.  Instead, she mimics true life. Her storyline was creative and unique.  I will be recommending this to my friends and family.  Keep up the great job Anne.  I'll be on the lookout for your next novel.  Welcome to the mystery writers' genre.  I think you have much to offer.
