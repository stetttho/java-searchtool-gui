 This was the first DeMille book I've read. His style and ability to draw the reader into the very midst of the action is a rare and appreciated quality.  This book resonated with me completely; perhaps because I've always believed there might just be a "Charm School" out there.  After this book, I went back and read each of DeMille's books.  This one remains among the top 2 of my favorites by this author.  Don't let this one get away, it will interfere with your daily functions because you won't be able to stop reading - then you'll want more...
