 By far one of my favorite DeMille books, this one grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the very end of the story. If only every book I read could be so compelling.  I've been handing down my books to my father, who is a voracious reader and the last time I gave him a carton of books, he went straight for the DeMille novel.  It's hard not to get hooked on this talented writer!  For a non-stop read, pick up this paperback, you won't regret it.
