 Venezia, City of Falling Angels, is every bit as captivating as the story woven by John Berendt. I remember my romance with Venice when I went there in the 70s.  How does John do it?  Berent has the ability to ingratiate himself into a foreign city or country and become the keeper of its secrets.  Secrets which he has willingly shared with his readership, Thank God!  After I finished the last page and closed the book, I got out my magnifying glass and inspected the inside cover to get a closer look at all of the places mentioned in the book.  Then I closed the cover and savored the ingredients, wanting to start all over again!  Few writers have this effect on me.  Maybe the reason is because, it would appear that for Berendt, writing a book is an experience to be lived and then written. Unlike the many formulaic authors who crank out book after book with no real research or intense feelings.  John Berendt is a quality writer and I have no doubt this book will be among the best sellers for a while to come.   Now, unfortunately, I have to wait another 3 -5 years until he writes the next book!  Keep 'em coming John, your instincts are supberb!
