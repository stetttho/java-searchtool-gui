 Russo is an artist when it comes to character development, but the story left me weary when I realized Miles was never going to take full responsibility for his life--sometimes I wanted to shake Miles.  Scenes and interchanges between Miles and those who populated his life were hysterical at times and predictable at others. All in all, a good read, but the ending was a bit contrived, too tidy.  Russo does a good job painting the "regular joe" who takes life as it comes, and doesn't take life by the throat--a fault we all engender at times. I enjoy the way Richard Russo develops his characters and I found myself caring for all of them, not just the "stars", but even the minor characters were well drawn and loveable.  It definitely seemed like a slice of small town America. I would definitely recommend the book and I'll read Russo again.
