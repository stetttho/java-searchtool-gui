 John Tucker does a excellent job in presenting a balanced approach to an unbalanced trial.  This was an engrossing tale of the darker side of our judicial system. Regardless who committed the murder, Roger Coleman did not receive a fair and just trial. While we will never know the truth, it seems that many miscarriages of justice occurred throughout this long process and there are many who will atone for Roger's death--the judge, the defense team, the prosecutors, the Governor and his staff, the Appeals Courts, the police and investigators, and the Almighty Supreme Court.  The one aspect of the murder that was never discussed was the motive for the crime, assuming Roger was the murderer?  Well written and worth the read.
