 Paniccia did a great service for any woman that may be thinking of filing a sexual discrimination suit.  Especially, if they already have filed suit and have a lawyer who is not forthcoming about what to expect. There were some areas of interest that I personally have that Paniccia did not cover, but overall this is a worthy read if you're contemplating a lawsuit.  It will prepare you in many ways and this type of preparation is necessary in order to survive a lawsuit of this nature.  No one but a woman who has endured sexual discrimination or retaliation could understand. Whereas Paniccia's case was outright and obvious with her "mommydom" memo, there are many women, I believe, who are constantly enduring discrimination only in more oblique/obtuse ways that can easily be covered over or explained away.  This is especially true in today's society where I do not think the court system is favorable to the individual.  Finding a lawyer who is truly dedicated to your cause and remembers that it's your case and you lived it is very important to succeeding.  These types of lawyers are few and far betweeen.  What with case loads so high, and the push by firms to take clients that can make big settlements, these cases often don't get the attention they deserve. Maybe if they made the settlements higher, more lawyers would be inclined to take the cases and then maybe there would be less tolerance in the workplace for this type of behavior.  Right now, it's still a good 'ol boy system and as long as it is, they'll make and break the rules as they please!
