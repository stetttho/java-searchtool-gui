 Philip Gourevitch captured my attention from the very beginning in this tightly wrapped true story on the nature of crime. It was nothing like I expected it to be and yet it was more than I had hoped for. Gourevitch should have a great future ahead of him as a novelist. He seems to have a knack for only sharing the necessary elements of a story--tight, terse, and brillant prose. Great research that makes me wish he would do a follow-up on what finally happens to Frankie Koehler and Rosenzweig. Try it, you won't be disappointed; only wishing it could have lasted longer.....
