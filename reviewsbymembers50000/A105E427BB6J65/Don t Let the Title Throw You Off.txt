 This is a great read with quality characters that you can really care about, because they're not so unlike yourself. While at times this book is screamingly funny, it is also heart renderingly sad.  Melissa Bank crawls into her characters and inhabits them, turning them so real you achingly feel every emotion they experience. I hope to see more books of this caliber from Bank in the future.  She's a fine new voice and a delight to read.  Keep 'em coming Melissa, I think you've found your voice!
