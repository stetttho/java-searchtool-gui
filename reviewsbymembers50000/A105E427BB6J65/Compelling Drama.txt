 Nelson DeMille is one of my favorite authors, and he did not disappoint with this thriller.  Unlike many authors, DeMille is not a formulaic writer and each book covers a diverse topic requiring intense research.  His acumen for finely drawn characters and breath-holding suspense are evident in Cathedral. Although not as good as Charm School or Word of Honor, still this is worth reading.  Keep 'em coming Nelson.
