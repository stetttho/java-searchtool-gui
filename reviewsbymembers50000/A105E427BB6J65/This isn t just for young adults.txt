 I picked this book up during a very difficult time in my life, right after my Mother died.  It attracted me because it was about Mothers and Daughters, and I was missing mine and needed a hidey-hole to forget about my present circumstances--motherless! Although I did not read the first book, I would recommend this book to every girl who has a mother and every mother who has a daughter.  There's a lot of life, love, misery, and joy between these pages and the traveling pants, while seemingly nonsensical, made this book a delight!  Take a chance, read the book, regardless of your age or gender.  I think you'll find you've made a wise decision and the tugs on your heartstrings will help you remember that you're still alive, even if, like some of us, the most important person in the world is no longer available to share it with you!  Thanks Ann Brashares for making my life more bearable at an awful time!
