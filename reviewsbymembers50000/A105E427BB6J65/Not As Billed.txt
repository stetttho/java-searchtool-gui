 I bought this book on the basis of the title Closing Arguments and the hype "a superb piece of courtroom drama.."  This book is neither.  It has little, if anything to do with action in the courtroom and the "closing arguments" leave more questions than answers. That being said, this book is an amazing look into the pysche of one rather disturbed dysfunctional male, who happens to be an attorney.  However, that is the only thing about his life that is real--nothing else is.  ...  In fact, his own past is somehow mired in the dark side of abuse, betrayal, and destruction.   While his wife, Schelle, tries to help him deal with a past she neither knows nor understands(by dedicating a Vietnam Memorial in their hometown), Marcus chooses another remedy.  He decides to exorcise his demons with the help of his current client, herself a sexually dysfunctional mess.  His plan is to leave his family the "Closing Arguments" and his bloody corpse.  It is the only way that he can see to extricate himself from the lifetime of lies that he has foisted upon his family, himself, and the community. I must say, I was put off by all the sexual exploitation that occurred between Marcus and his client.   It was only after I had completed the book and rethought the plot, that I realized it is indeed a finely crafted novel.  I don't think I'd want too many more of these in a row though, its very dark and disturbing.  But, in the final anaylis, it's worth the read.  I will try anothr Busch novel before I make any final decisions on whether his writing style is something I want to spend a lot of time on.
