 This book, however well written it may be, left me feeling like I was caught in Dubus' fog and standing on his quick sand.  I forced myself through the first half in the hopes of finding something morally enlightening or spiritually uplifting.  I was NOT to be rewarded. This book continued its downward spiral until the very end.  I found all of Andre's characters to be stereo-typical, the men--macho and controlling, and the women--weak and helpless.  Even though Kathy had serious issues, and Mrs. Behrani was a product of her culture, these 2 at least attempted to deal with the "ownership" of the home in an honorable way.  Unlike many readers, I did not find Mr. Behrani honorable or noble.  No man that treats women like he did is deserving of respect, regardless of what his cultural teachings may find acceptable.  And, Lester, was the typical bully, hiding behind his badge and feeding his need for excitement through a veneer of helpfullness. Mr. Dubus uses an engaging style and his writing is good, but this book had no redeeming value for me.  Character development was weak for Kathy and Lester.  I felt like I was starting the book somewhere in the middle where I should know why Kathy's mother and brother found her a loser and why her husband left her.  The entire experience was not unlike eating cotton candy.  It left me feeling sticky but still hungry.  Now, I have to go find a "meat and potatoes" book.
