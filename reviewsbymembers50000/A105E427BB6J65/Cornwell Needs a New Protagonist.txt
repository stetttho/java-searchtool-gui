 While I admire Patricia Cornwell's writing style and her heroine, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, I almost didn't make it through this thriller.  It was only because this was a hardback edition of a gift that I perservered.  I'm glad I did, because after the first third of the novel, with its morose introspection, it finally takes flight.  With some twists and turns, many predictable, the novel takes hold of the reader and the romp is pure "Corn"wellian! Still, I think Cornwell has nearly reached the bottom of the barrel in her escapades with Kay.  It's time for a new, more compelling heroine who doesn't have a niece that is brilliant, wealthy, forceful, lesbian, ex-FBI & ex-ATF, helicopter-piloting, & fitness-obsessed.  It's just a bit too much of a stretch...  Same old, same old!  It's time to reach down and find some new material.  But, based on the ending, there will need to be a least one more Kay Scarpetta to tie up all the loose ends.  But then, please Patricia, put your enormous talents into something fresh and untried!  Your talent is bound-up, let yourself go free!
