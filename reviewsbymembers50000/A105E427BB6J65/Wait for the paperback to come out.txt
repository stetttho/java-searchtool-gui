 For anyone who is a fan of Baldacci's suspense novels, this may fall far short of your expectations!  I grabbed this one hot off the press because of my preference for Baldacci's literary susspense style.   After recognizing Wish You Well was a complete departure from his previous works, I decided to keep an open mind, since it appeared Baldacci has been wanting to try a different genre.  I came away disappointed, however, in what I considered a rather pat, shallow story.  Though the potential was great and the characters worthy of exploration, David falls short, leaving me with a feeling that it will take him additional attempts before he can touch the human spirit via this type of novel.  All of the ingredients were present in the novel--it just didn't go deep enough.  Perhaps David tried to put too many of his ideas into one book and wound up doing only an adequate job.  I wouldn't discourage him from future attempts, as he'll undoubtably get better at this type of writing.  In the meantime, I hope he returns to the suspense writing for which he's earned an admirable reputation.
