 This book sat in a refrigerator for 30 years before being published.  Unfortunately, I can see why.  Although, some of the author's "conversations among characters" were good, a lot of it was trivial, regardless of the time period in which it was written.  Although I was young in the 70s, I have a hard time remembering women's lib in quite the way it was written here.    But, I guess the biggest disappointment for me was that I never felt that anything was ever brought to final closure.  That last chapter "Pete," in particular. was very unsatisfying.  Had it been published in the 70s, it may have been a bigger success, but again, this was a rather disappointing read.
