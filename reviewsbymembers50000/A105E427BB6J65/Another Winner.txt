 This book took me by storm!  I was truly impressed with MacDonald's ability to weave the story line and characters together into such a rich and dynamic book.  It's got something for everyone, though I don't imagine everyone would appreciate this story because it deals with issues that some of us don't want to read about. I loved the characters and MacDonald has a way of making you feel their emotions, their pain, their joy, their confusion, their cruelty, their regret.  I would recommend this to anyone.  In fact, I loaned my copy to a friend who doesn't get a chance to read for entertainment, since she goes to school and works full time!   I know that once she starts this and gets caught up in it, she'll not be able to finish her homework until she finishes the book!  I hope it doesn't mess up her GPA, but this is definitely a book worth recommending. Come on Ann-Marie, give us another one.
