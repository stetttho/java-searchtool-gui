 While I had some trouble first getting into the book due to the myriad of characters, I liked the plot concept, so I perservered.  I was not disappointed.  Once I was able to get all the characters straight, this was non-stop action with an ending that delivered!  The characters were believeable and not so glam damn perfect as to be boring.  Even the romance angle was well-written.  Hats off to  JC Pollock for a tightly written suspenseful gripping trip through an often written about genre!  I will look for more of Pollock's work as this book was entertaining, complicated, and intelligent.  Much better than a Clancy novel!!  Kudos Pollock!
