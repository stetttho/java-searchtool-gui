 A great read, my first Thayer suspense novel, but not my last.  I was impressed with Thayer's ability to develop so many tightly written characters capable of drawing the reader into their lives and into the action.  Not a wasted word in this crisp WWII Nazi thriller.  The dialogue was tight, the characters well developed and the "hero", Jack Cray while relentless and ruthless is also honorable and noble--not an easy task to wrap into one character and still make him believable. Thayer did an excellent job!  Put this on your "to read" list.
