 This book defys description.  Is it a love story? Yes.  A mystery? Yes.  A thriller?  Yes.  Fiction?  I don't know....and that's what makes it so compelling.  This is a book for a reading group because it will elicit so many more questions than there are answers and after you've completed it, believe me, you're going to want to talk about it with someone else who's read it. The construct was terrific and as a result I book 2 more of O'Brien's books immediately.  While both were good, neither matched the plot, suspense, and tempo of In the Lake of the Woods.  I would recommend this book to anyone, but I especially think Vietnam Vets could really relate. Now, I'm off to try Tomcat in Love.  Since O'Brien can write the serious scary stuff that only nightmares are made of, I want to see what he can do with humor and love. What a find.  I'm so glad I found this book listed in Bas Bleu because I hadn't seen it hyped anywhere else.
