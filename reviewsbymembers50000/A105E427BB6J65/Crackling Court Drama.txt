 This author moves right to the top of my list of proficient authors of gripping ripping great courtroom drama!  Wow!! Finally a book that appears to be based in reality!  I was riveted from start to finish and felt a connection with the entire cast of characters!  The molding of humor, tragedy, and legalese was flawless.  This is one compelling, quick-paced novel that you don't want to miss, especially if you're getting tired of all of the writers whose characters are constantly leaping tall buildings in a single stride.  Baine Kerr brings back morality, reality, and about as much justice as one can get in this world. Like Baine says: "Trial is an imperfect alternative to bloodshed."  Keep 'em coming Kerr!!  I'll be waiting...
