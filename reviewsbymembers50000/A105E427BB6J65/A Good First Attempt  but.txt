 I must be getting too picky, cuz I like my thrillers to be realistic and I like the weaver to complete the picture.  This novel, while a good first attempt is not great.  The characters were a bit too over the top--General Buck Perry, cold blooded killer?  Sarah Peterson's rise to the top of her field, but after her first day on the job of protecting the Secretary of State, she spends the rest of the novel solving the kidnapping.  Seems like her boss would have noticed her absence?  The double cross by Grizz was predictable, but added the necessary opportunity for a display of fire power. However, even the shoot-out at the lighthouse, while off to a great start, was disappointing in the end.  And, how about Walter?  How come his snooping for Sarah never gets him in trouble.  He seems to continually tap and peek into places that got his lab friend killed, yet he's allowed to satisfy all of the questions Sarah can't get to on her own.  Finally, the letter at the end did not blend with the story line and appeared too contrived.  I'm not sure why it would even be included, unless Steve Samuel wants an easy sequel?  Samuel has some great scenes and some white-finger action in this book, and he shows great promise.  I hope he'll not take the easy way out next time.  I prefer my heros and heroines to be a little more down-to-earth and real, not the untouchable glitz that we can get from Hollywood.  Keep trying Steve, you're almost there....
