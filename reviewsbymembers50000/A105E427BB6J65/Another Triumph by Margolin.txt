 I was disappointed to see the first reviewer give this book only 1 star and suggest to other readers they should pass it over.  I felt that this was a great twisted plot, although at times the characters were a bit thinly drawn--however, who really knows what childhood events can turn one into a raging sociopath?  Certainly there was a lot of thought, and unique devices employed by Margolin in his storyline.  I was really ready to be entertained and escape from the everyday work world and this certainly did it for me, keeping me up two nights in a row so I could find out if I had the killer figured out.  Of course, I changed my mind twice, but I caught the slip made by the madman long before Amanda did--but it was easier from the outside.  All in all, a good get-away summer read.  You may not want to be alone while you read it!
