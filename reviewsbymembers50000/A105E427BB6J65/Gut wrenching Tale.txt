 Although not a complete Lehane fan, based on some of his other novels, I decided to give Mystic River a read before seeing the movie.  I was not disappointed.   This was powerhouse writing at its best.  It's hard to call this simply a good mystery novel when it is so much more.  It contains a complex, penetrating and melancholy plot that delves into some of the moral issues of our day.  It reaches deep into the blackest of hearts and searches out the haunting results of childhood innocence lost.  This book isn't just about child molestation, thugs, crime, mystery, and petty criminals.  It's about evil and innocence, friendship and betrayal, love and guilt. It's about how our childhood experiences mold us into the adults we are, regardless of how hard we might try to fight it. This is a gripping tale and I found myself constantly going back and re-reading several passages to ensure that I fully understood all the plot twists and turns.  Truly it is disturbing and there is ugliness in it, because there is ulgliness in human nature--and that may put off some readers.  However, Mystic River represents a book that is well-written and intelligently plotted with good dialgoue. I would recommend it to anyone who likes crime or mystery novels.
