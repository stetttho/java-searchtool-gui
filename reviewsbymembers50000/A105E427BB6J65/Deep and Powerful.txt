 WOW!  This novel hit me on a number of levels.  Griffith knows how to draw the reader in and then POW! deliver the 'ol one/two sucker punch. Aud is a delightful character--multifaceted and real.  Girffith develops the book in such a way that I can see the cabin surrounded by trees, feel the breeze, and smell the dirt while in the next instance I can feel the grit of New York City, hear the blaring noise, and feel the sun glaring off the asphalt--all within the space of a page.   Although the premise of a hip know-it-all type like Tammy being sucked into a mindless slave may be hard for some to believe, it struck a real nerve with me.  I faltered a little on the way Aud disabled the dirty rotten scoundrel, as details were sketchy, but for such a minor oversight, who cares.... The rest was brilliant! This book, on so many levels, is extemely well written and absorbing.  It touches so many feelings from grief to brutality, yet expounds on each so that you won't feel cheated by any of the characters or emotions that will roil through you as you suck this novel down. Now, I guess I'll have to go back and read some of Giffith's earlier works.  This is one talented lady!
