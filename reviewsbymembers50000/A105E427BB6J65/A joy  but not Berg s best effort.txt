 I did not read "Durable Goods" and did not realize this was a continuation.  However, Joy School took me back to a younger, more innocent time of my life and for that alone, it was worth the read.  While this is a pleasant way to spend time in a waiting room or on an airplane, it's not a book that will stick to your ribs.  It's simply a pleasant companion for an afternoon and then its gone.  This is very unlike other Berg books that I have read and loved.  While not her best effort, it's still fun to read. "Talk Before Sleep" and "Open House" are much better Berg novels and will stay with you for sustained periods after the final page is done.  Still, I wouldn't want to dissuade anyone from picking up Joy School--I'm sure you'll enjoy it, you'll laugh, you might cry--but you will be moved emotionally at some level.  This is one great author!  Her simple prose and straight from the heart writing is such a welcome relief from some of the often painfully contrived popular writers of the day.  Keep em coming Elizabeth!
