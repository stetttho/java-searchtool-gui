 Ok, I admit, I'm still confused.  But, unlike many reviewers, I'm not angry about it.  I'm titilated.  Afterall, not every author could blow your socks off on the last page.  I'll even admit that after I finished the book, I went back and reread the first chapter again, picking up on things I'd missed before. I definitely feel this book could keep a reading group debating for hours.  And, that is what makes for a great read--something that haunts you, makes you think, even curse, question your sanity, or question the author's sanity.  But anyone who reads this completely through and comes away with a "ho hum" attitude is either brain dead or decieving his/herself.  You'll either love it or hate it, there isn't much room for complacency in this novel. It did remind me a little of the movie Momento in terms of starting at the end and working backwards and finally wondering what actually happened.  Writing in reverse order (from ending to beginning) like Shreve did cannot be easy and for this alone I applaud her. Don't listen to the naysayers.  Give this book a chance.  And if you're convinced you understand it completely, drop me a line!  You're someone worth talking to....
