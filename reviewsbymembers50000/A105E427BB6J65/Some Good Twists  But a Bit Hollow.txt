 While I enjoy Sandra Brown and will continue to read her novels, I did feel like I was caught between a dime romance novel and a real mystery writer's novel in this particular storyline--The Switch.   A lot of the writing struck me as a bit over the edge--contrived, and reality was completely lacking in some areas.  That being said, the premise was a great one and the idea was inventive and not overdone.  However, overall, I would have preferred a few more blemishes on the characters and more chill, less thrill and less of a feeling that I was looking at a hyped-up soap-opera.  There were some nice twists and turns, but I was anxious to get to the end, so I could find something more substantial to read. Too much butter on the popcorn, Sandra.  I would rather use my own imagination than have everything so set up for me.  It just wasn't a thinking woman's suspense novel, in my opinion.
