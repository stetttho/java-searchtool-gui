 Elizabeth Berg has such canny insight into human nature and has the ability to find warmth and humanity in everything that would be considered by many as dull or normal. But, there is nothing normal about her writing. It is extraordinary, touching, and emotionally connected in a way that most authors never achieve with their characters. She never misses a beat. I have yet to read one of her novels without laughing out loud and crying and wishing against odds that life would not be so cruel. And yet, Berg always brings me back to a strong hope in human resilence as we stumble through this thing called life. Myra--if only I had a friend like you!!!!  Write on, Elizabeth, write on....
