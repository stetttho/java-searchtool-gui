 I enjoyed learning more about the Amish way of life through this book.  I felt that all of the characters were believable and for the most part likeable. I did have a little bit of a problem getting around the fact that no one but the mother noticed that Katie was pregnant  And, I also question whether, upon waking, a young girl (even an innocent Amish girl) wouldn't have been astounded and curious about where her new infant had gone. I was hoping for more in the court room and found the final settlement a bit trite.  I'm too cynical to believe the justice system works this way. All in all, this was a quick and interesting read.  I will buy another Picoult book because I did enjoy the character development and the research that went into this novel.
