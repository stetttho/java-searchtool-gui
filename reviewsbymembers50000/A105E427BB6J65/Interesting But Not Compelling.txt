 After listening to Dunne on Larry King Live, I was very interested in his chronicles of some of the high profile murders of recent times. Dunne is a good writer, entertaining, and worth reading.  However, there was nothing new in this book.  The man does get around socially and subsequently, he gets his story.  While Dominick Dunne speaks with an honest voice, he's still singing the same old tune.  Maybe I'm tired of hearing about OJ?  I remain baffled about the title because Justice was certainly never accomplished for many of the rich and famous of which he writes.  Ho Hum...
