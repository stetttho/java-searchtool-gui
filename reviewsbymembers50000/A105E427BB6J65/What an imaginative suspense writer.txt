 Janet Evanovich's series with Steph Plum just keeps getting more and more hilarious and fun! Janet has the ability to draw characters like few other suspense thriller writers of her genre. I particularly enjoy the fact that they don't have perfect hair or leap over tall buildings in a single bound, but instead they find themselves in ridiculous situations that bring them the humanity and commonality that is so frequently missing in suspense novels. There is none of the perfect chisled characters who are wise beyond belief. But instead, we get Plum, her granny, her sexual desires, her cousin Vinnie, and failed attempts that make for great reading escapes and enjoyable entertainment. Be careful not to read this one in a public place because you'll find yourself bursting out loud with laughter and either someone will wrestle it away from you or they'll clear extra space for you. Who cares! Enjoy this "hot" sexy read and then get on to the next one.
