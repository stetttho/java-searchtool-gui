 I like Alice Hoffman as a writer, and this book certainly had the potential to be a pot boiler.  Great characters, nice magical references, but it appears Alice got to a certain page and decided to wrap it up.  No ryhme, no reason.  The plot did not deserve this ending.  I'm left feeling very unfulfilled.  I'm not even certain of the reason for the name of the book, let alone why one of the better characters is killed off early on and we're not ever given a satisfactory reason. And then other characters appear but don't seem to stay around of have any purpose, like Sean Byers. And Betsy running away with Abe????  The pharmacist suddenly discussing everything with his wife.  This isn't the result of magic, but lack of imagination maybe?  None of the actions or character/plotline prepares the reader for the way Alice wraps up a tidy little ending, unfit for the great beginning.  Quite a let down.  Did Alice run out of steam on this one?  I won't give up on Hoffman, but this was not her best effort.
