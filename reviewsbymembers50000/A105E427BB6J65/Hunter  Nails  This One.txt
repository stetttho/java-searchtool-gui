 Bob, the "Nailer" is a protagonist that we can all relate to, respect, and understand.  He doesn't leap buildings with a single bound unlike some overdrawn hero-types; he has his problems, but you're gonna like him as the "star" of this well-written, tightly wrapped thriller.  This is by far my favorite Stephen Hunter novel--to date.  It may be a wee bit over the top, but not only will the suspense keep you turning the pages, but the court room drama ending will not disappoint.  All of the characters are well-drawn and you will get swept into the action, rooting for Swagger until the very end...  Swagger does deserve to have his time of "redemption" and he gets it in spades... Go on, do yourself a favor, read this book.
