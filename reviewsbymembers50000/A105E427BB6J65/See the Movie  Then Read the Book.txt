 No question, the book is better than the movie.   But, if you see the movie without certain expectations, you will truly enjoy a great movie and great acting. Then go sit down and absorb the book on all levels, as it is the movie and so much more.  You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll be annoyed, angry, and confused, but you'll never be bored. I can't believe that there are some reviewers that absolutely hated this book.  I know it takes all kinds, I would like to know what kind of books they do find entertaining. All through the book, I could hear the words reverberate through my mind in the exaggeratd Southern drawl of Siddha's momma.   By far, one of my best summer reads.  Great characters, dysfunctional lives and the scars they create, forgiveness, fun, and futility--the very essence of life is contained within the pages of this novel.  Don't miss it.
