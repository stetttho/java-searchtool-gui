 I wasn't too sure when I started this little caper if it was a retelling of a true crime story or an inventive package designed to steal my attention.  I wasn't even certain after the first couple of chapters that this was the type of mystery story that I would enjoy.  BUT, look out, this book will creep up on you and seize your imagination and there will be no way out until you've completed it.  And, even then I found myself going back to the beginning of the novel and rereading the first several chapters. Wilson does a great job of captivating the audience through the use of three very different protagonists all with varying but valid points.  It takes the sum of the parts to more than equal this great first novel.  Keep em coming Laura.  I can't wait for your next enterprise to hit the streets.  I know that it will be as inventive and unique as this adventure.  Great Read!!!
