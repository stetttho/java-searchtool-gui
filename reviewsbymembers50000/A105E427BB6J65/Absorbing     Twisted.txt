 As an avid reader of Nazi-related fiction and nonfiction, I found this book totally captivating.  Little did I know about how far the Nazi regime reached into other countries, cultures, etc.   The writing is so compelling that I had to remind myself that I was reading a fiction crime novel and not a true story. The double track (1941 vs 1990s)storyline is compelling and accomplished seamlessly.  The characters are developed in such a manner that you will despise them, ache for them, or want to kill them yourself.   I can't see how anyone could finish this novel without generating deep feelings towards the characters and their activities. Tautly written, but violent and steamy.  May be too much for the weak of stomach to imagine that human to human interaction can be so heartless and cruel.  For those who cling to historical or personal revenge, grip tight for an engrossing, intellectually wrought rendering that will leave you squirming and reading late into the night. By far, this was one of the better books I've read this summer.  If you don't mind tension and edgy flawed characters, and how the sins of the past haunt the present, then you'll want to pick up a copy of this gem.  Staring human nature in the face can be a terrifying experience, even from a distance, but Wilson has managed to pull it off.  I'll be looking for more of Robert Wilson in the future.  I highly recommend this book.
