 I thoroughly enjoyed Brett's novel, even though the ending left me wondering what would happen next.  I enjoyed the gutsy Ruth and her unforgiving attitude about what her parents had endured.  Sometimes she seemed to go over the top and I would think--"Lighten up!", but the overall effect was necessary for her character.  I loved her Father, who made me laugh and remember my grandparents, also from an East European country, who (although they lived in the states for many years) still pronounced many words in their wacky endearing way. The Hoss character I still can't put to rest. But, it made the novel interesting, even if I don't quite understand why Brett used this device and what we're actually supposed to assume he was.  Was he just the imagination of an overwrought angry Jewish woman, determined to relive her parents pain?  Whatever.  Hoss still provided an avenue for Brett to give us another perspective that would otherwise be unavailable to today's writer.  And, in that sense, I applaud Brett's imagination. I did feel Brett cut the ending short, making me think there must be a sequel coming.  But maybe this is just another one of her devices to keep the reader wondering and thinking about the book. There were any number of coincidences in the book that could be seen as too fantastic to believe.  But, even so, this was a really great read!  Very deceptive title, especially for the nonreader.  My husband was very curious because I don't read "romance" novels and he couldn't figure out what kind of book I was reading late into the night! Keep 'em coming Lily!
