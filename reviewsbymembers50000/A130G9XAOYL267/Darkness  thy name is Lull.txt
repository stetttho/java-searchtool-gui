 This CD starts off with the aptly named 23 minute opus "Slow Fall Inward." A low frequency synthesizer drone shifts and morphs throughout the piece while distant high pitched wails, like the voices of shrieking banshees, punctuate the soundscape. Perfect music for pondering your failures and regrets. Perfect music for wallowing in the pain of your broken heart. Perfect music for plotting revenge on your enemies. Perfect music for worrying about whether or not there is a hell. Perfect, crushing, dark ambience. If you have suicidal tendencies, this will be the last piece of music you hear.
