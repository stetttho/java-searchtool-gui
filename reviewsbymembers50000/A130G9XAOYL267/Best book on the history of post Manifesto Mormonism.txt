 How does a religious movement transform itself from a regional subculture nestled in the Rocky Mountains to an international Christian denomination? The answer is contained in this book. When this work was first published, the history of post-Manifesto Mormonism was terra incognita. Now, almost 20 years after its initial release, this is still the best historical overview of Mormonism in the early 20th century, and a Mormon history classic. If you want to know how the religion of polygamy and the Mountain Meadows massacre became the conservative, all-American LDS church of today, start right here. The chapters on politics and the bureaucratization and standardization of church polity and practice are particularly indispensable. What can I say? This is a masterpiece!
