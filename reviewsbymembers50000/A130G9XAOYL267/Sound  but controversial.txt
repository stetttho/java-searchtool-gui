 An exhaustively documented and detailed study of the first days of Mormonism. Marquardt and Walters contend that much of the early history of Mormonism, as told by Joseph Smith, was invented after the fact. They show how Smith's early theologies were immersed in the occult, and how the religious revivals that supposedly inspired Smith could not have happened when he said they did. Very tightly argued, and very controversial. A devastating critique of the official story of Mormon origins.
