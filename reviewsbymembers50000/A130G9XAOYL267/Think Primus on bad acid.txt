 This is the most extreme album I have ever heard. No vocalist can keep this up for long, so fans of DEP should enjoy their music while he still has a voice. I actually wish he'd shut up a little more often and let the  players jam out. The music is very technical with crazy time changes and  awesome playing. The drumming is phenomenal. I give it five stars because  it is very good, and breaks totally new musical ground. (Although my  roomate dosen't call it music!) If you like this you should check out  Meshuggah's Destroy-Erase-Improve.
