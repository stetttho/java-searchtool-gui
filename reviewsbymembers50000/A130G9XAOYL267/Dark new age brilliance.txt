 Imagine Patrick O'Hearn is posessed by Satan. If that were the case, this would be the album he'd release. Anderson wrote this music to be a sountrack for sadomasochistic sex. (Literally) But it works equally well for when you're in a melancholy mood, or you want to listen to something dark and foreboding. If you're a fan of O'Hearn, particularly his darker stuff like Metaphor or Indigo, you're gonna dig this one.
