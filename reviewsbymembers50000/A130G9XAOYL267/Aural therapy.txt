 Minimal synthesizer chords that are held for about 10 seconds, and then morph into the next chord. This goes on for over an hour. There is no rhythm, no discernable time signature, and nothing remotely approaching melody. Sound boring? Guess again. The chord changes are very diverse and progress in interesting ways. Sometimes soft major chords will drift into one another, sometimes they will morph into dissonant minor chords, only to be resolved in a few seconds by shifting into another pleasing chord. The overall effect is one of tension and release, repeated over and over, and produces a state of relaxation and calm. Play this to soothe your infant, or after a hard day at work. I defy you to stay awake through the whole CD. This album will cure insomnia, and I mean that as a compliment.
