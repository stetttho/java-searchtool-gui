 Vostok is a lake lying below the Antarctic ice. On this CD Padilla evokes the kind of lonely solitude that one would expect in such a cold, isolated place. He develops his themes slowly, laying one melodic line upon another, and then slowly disassembles the music until he is back to the frozen, breathy ambient chords that started the piece. If you are a fan of Steve Roach, Robert Rich, John Serrie, or the more introspective works of Patrick O'Hearn, Jarre, and Tangerine Dream, then you MUST buy this album. It is an ambient new age masterpiece.
