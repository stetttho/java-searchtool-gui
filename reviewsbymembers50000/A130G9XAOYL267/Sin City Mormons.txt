 This is a nicely written journalistic account of Mormons and Mormonism in Las Vegas. The author does a fine job showing how the LDS church has managed to secure considerable political power, even in Sin City. (Think what kind of power they must wield in Salt Lake!) Along the way, readers are introduced to the mind set of modern Mormonism, and the methods that the Mormon political machine employs to get its way. A nice, breezy read. You'll have fun with this one.
