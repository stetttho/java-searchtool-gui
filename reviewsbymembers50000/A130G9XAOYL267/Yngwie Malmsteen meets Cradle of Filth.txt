 If you like black metal and you like neo-classical guitar shredding then by all means pick up this album. The guitar player has some furious licks, and the rest of the band is surprisingly solid given their young age. I  can't decide whether this album is ahead of it's time, or  "retro." The songs are well written and melodic but with ample  complexity. A good album.
