 This is a phenomenal CD. The musicianship is absolutely KILLER, especially the drumming. This is the best Spyro Gyra album and the last one before the band degenerated into dentist chair jazz. Sad, because this album has more  chops than a butcher shop and really shows that the "smooth jazz"  genre can be more than just air pudding. I highly recommend this album. If  you like it and want to buy more Spyro Gyra, be sure to go BACKWARDS in  time.
