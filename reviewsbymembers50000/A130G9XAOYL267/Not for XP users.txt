 I bought this device and brought it home with great expectations. I was disappointed. First off, the company does not make XP drivers, and the only drivers you can get for it work with Music Match Jukebox. That's OK, if, like me, you use Music Match. However, the drivers are Beta versions, and they are not approved for use with XP. Not only that, whenever I turned off my computer and plugged the device back in to reload MP3s, the computer forced me to reinstall the drivers. I was willing to live with that, but I was not willing to live with the problems that I had once the files were downloaded. Everything seemed flawless, until I started playing my music back. It seems as though parts of the song don't make the trip and the music seems to skip. Very annoying and frustrating. This problem happened on both of my computers at home which use XP Pro. However, when I used it with my computer at work, running Win 2K, everything worked great. SO the bottom line is, if you don't use XP and you never will, this is a great purchase. If you do use XP, this little thing with give you big trouble.
