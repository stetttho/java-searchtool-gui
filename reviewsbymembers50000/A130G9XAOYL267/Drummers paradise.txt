 This CD features a young, raw, brash Dave Weckl at the peak of his career. There are probably four or five extended drum solos on this album and each one is totally mind blowing. Weckl's drumming on this and the Acoustic  Band's studio CD totally changed the way I view the instrument, and firmly  ensconced Weckl in my mind as the most technically proficient drummer of  all time. Oh yeah, the keys and bass are good too.
