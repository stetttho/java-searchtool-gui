 If you're investigating this CD because you're a Kings X fan then buy it. If you're investigating this CD because you're a Dream Theater or Planet X fan then skip it. I disagree with one of the other reviewers here. I  thought this Platypus CD was less progressive than the first one. (The  progressive epic "Partial to the Bean" sounds a lot like filler  to me.) I also think the first one was heavier.
