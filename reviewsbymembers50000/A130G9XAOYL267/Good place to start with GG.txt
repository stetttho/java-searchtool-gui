 This is the best Gentle Giant CD, and the one that serves as the best introduction to the band. It usually takes more than one listen to really appreciate the music. It is pretty complex stuff. The sound quality on this CD is terrible, though. I wish some nice record company would release a  remastered version. If you like early Genesis, Yes, or King Krimson, then  take a chance on Gentle Giant.
