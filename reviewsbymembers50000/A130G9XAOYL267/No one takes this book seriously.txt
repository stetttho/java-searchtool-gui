 This book exhibits deep flaws and methodological failings. The author advances his argument--that Mormonism is some sort of Christian/Masonic populist movement--through speculation, a dubious and selective reading of historical sources, and "cherry-picked" parallels. I have no idea how this work made it through the peer review process at Columbia University press, although Forsberg mentions that one of the reviewers was John Brooke, whose own speculative work on Mormon origins has come under fire. Still, at least Brooke's speculations were interesting and consistent with existing literature. By contast, Forsberg's "examples as evidence" approach will convince no one (LDS or otherwise) who knows Mormon history. This book should not have been published, least of all by a press like Columbia.
