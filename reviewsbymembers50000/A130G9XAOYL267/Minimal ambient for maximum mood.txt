 Brannan Lane is less famous than Robert Rich and Steve Roach, but his best stuff is as good as either of these luminaries. On this CD he is at his most minimal and moody. Lane bills this CD as music to sleep to, and I suspect it would be good for that, provided you like to nod off with dark, pensive thoughts in your head. The mood is decidedly brooding and melancholic, and this music would be a great while reading a scary novel, or lying in a dark room contemplating your mortality.
