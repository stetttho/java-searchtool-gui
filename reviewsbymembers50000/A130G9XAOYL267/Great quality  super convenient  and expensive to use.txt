 This little printer spits out borderless 4x6 photos that are completely indistinguishable from those you would get from a photo lab. However, each 4x6 print costs, according to my calculations, just over 62 cents--and that's just for consumables (paper and cartridges) and does not factor in the price of the unit itself. Think about that before you buy it. My wife can't live without this thing because of how nice it is to have great looking photos printed on demand. I'm not so sure the convenience justifies the price.
