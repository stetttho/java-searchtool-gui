 I was a little kid and up late one night when the "Welcome to my Nightmare" TV special aired. The music videos for the creepy music on this album enthralled me, and scared the living sh*t out of me. Thirty years later, I still listen to this album frequently. The final act featuring the insane, diabolical Steven still scares me, and Cold Ethyl remains my all-time favorite song about necrophilia. ;-) Welcome to my Nightmare is twisted, evil, maniacal genius.
