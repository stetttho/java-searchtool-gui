 This is about as close to pop music as I get. The songs are very accesible with a progressive edge. The musicianship is excellent, except for the fact that the bass is buried in the mix. (That seems to be the way John Myung  likes it!) There is a lot of variety here: some instrumentals, some pop  songs, and Willie Brown - a song that starts off with a killer 9/8 riff!  Highly recommended. This CD practically camped out in my CD player when it  first came out.
