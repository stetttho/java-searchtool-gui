 It seems that this CD is out of print. Too bad, because this is THE definitive ethereal ambient CD. Vir Unis creates a drifting, morphing soundscape that envelops the listener. Residing in the neutral territory between "happy" ambient like Liquid Mind and "dark" ambient like Lustmord, this CD creates an atmosphere that you can interpret however you like. Great for meditation, reading, sleeping, sex, or any other occaision when you need some aural wallpaper. Check out Vir Unis's other ethereal ambient release "Aeonian Glow" as well.
