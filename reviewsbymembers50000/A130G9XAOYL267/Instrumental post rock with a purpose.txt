 Light guitar melodies repeated over a sparse rhythm section give these songs a light, nimble feel. But the chord changes and effects leaven this mood with a dose of melancholy. The earlier tracks on the album are the best, and track two is worth the price of the CD. Excellent background music for light reading, good conversation, or kicking back with the headphones.
