 If you're looking for a great trade press biography of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, you can do no better than this. Bushman's book is well written, engaging, and fairly thorough. However, if you're looking for the definitive scholarly treatment of Joseph Smith, you're out of luck. As is typical of trade press biographies, the emphasis is on the narrative, and thus digressions into the many scholarly debates that surround Joseph Smith and the birth of Mormonism are necessarily truncated. In addition, when these controversies are engaged, there is often a whiff of pro-Mormon bias. For instance, Bushman explains the various accounts of Joseph Smith's first vision by arguing that the vision was sacred, and hence Smith released details bit by bit. This completely sidesteps the fact that the "bit by bit" elaboration of the first vision story closely mirrors the evolution of the Mormon concept of God--something that scholars have very carefully documented. (See Kurt Widmer's _Mormonism and the Nature of God_)  In the end, however, these shortcomings do nothing to diminish the quality of this biography for probably 99 percent of this book's likely readership, be they Mormon or otherwise. And I give Bushman credit for his frank admissions about some of the unsavory aspects of Smith's life, including his polyamorous lifestyle. Good but not great. Basically sound but not definitive. Pro-Mormon, but not obnoxiously so.
