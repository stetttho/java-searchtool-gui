 There is little to add here that hasn't already been said by other reviewers. This is certainly one of the most important "chill out" albums ever made. But it ain't ambient in the truest sense of the word, so reviewers claiming that it is aren't completely accurate. Certain tracks, like the brilliant 9'39"  are ambient, but much of the rest has the kind of beats and tempos that are much more associated with house music. Still, this is great stuff, and if you're inclined to investigate ambient music, this is a great way to ease into the genre.
