 This is very sparse ambient music, along the lines of the most minimal works of Steve Roach or Robert Rich. I like to sleep to music like this, although I think most normal people would find the mood too brooding and dark. But if you're abnormal like me, and you like deep, instrospective soundscapes for sleeping, reading, working, or as aural wallpaper, this one is about as good as it gets.
