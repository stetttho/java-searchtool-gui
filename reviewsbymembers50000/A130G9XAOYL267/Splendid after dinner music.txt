 This last word in technical death metal. This music is beyond fast, beyond brutal, and beyond belief. The drummer is either an octopus or is possessed by Satan. The blast beats and double bass rolls are incomprehensibly fast. (I think he may be an octopus possessed by Satan.) Listen to the sound samples for "Portal" and imagine the smoke coming off of that man's bass drum pedals. Anyway, this album makes a perfect mother's day gift, and if you play it for your new girlfriend, you're guaranteed to get laid.
