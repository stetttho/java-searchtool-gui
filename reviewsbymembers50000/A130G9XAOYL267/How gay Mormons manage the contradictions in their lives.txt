 A sociological study of homosexuals and homosexuality within the Mormon church. The book points out that many gay Protestants in conservative denominations can easily switch to a more liberal church and harmonize their faith with their sexual orientation. This is not the case for Mormons. Mormonism has a distinctive theology, and sees itself as the only true church. It is also a very anti-gay organization. Thus, when gay Mormons try to meet their spiritual needs, they find themselves in a terrible bind. The book is an interesting study of ordinary people in an impossible predicament, and an informative portrait of a conservative church that has been forced to confront gay people within its ranks.
