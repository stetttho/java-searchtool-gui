 People who rave about this thing either work for the company or are vision impaired. I bought one on a whim so I could take it with me on vacation. I can honestly say that of the 100s of pictures I took with it, not one was a keeper. The shutter stays open for so long that unless you are completely motionless, your pictures are blurred. I found that subjects centered in the view finder do not end up centered in the pictures. The camera "crashed" often, and I needed to take out the battery to "reboot" it. This happened a lot. The camera worked in sunlight, but pics taken indoors were way too dark. This thing is not ready for prime time. not even at these prices.
