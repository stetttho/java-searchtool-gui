 I really enjoyed this album. The musicianship is top notch, and the sound has elements of Yes, early Rush, Genesis and other classic prog rock bands. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the lyrics aren't as  polished as the music. Still, this one grabbed me on first listen, and I  still spin it quite a bit. Highly recommended.
