 The perfect blend between the best of Robert Rich's tribal works and the new age classics of Patrick O'Hearn. Flow is a little too ambient to be called New Age, and a little too New Age to be pure ambient. Wisps of melody waft over light percussion, and create an atmosphere conducive to meditation, sleep, or study. If you are looking to get into ambient music, this is the type of work that can ease you into the genre. Highly reccommended.
