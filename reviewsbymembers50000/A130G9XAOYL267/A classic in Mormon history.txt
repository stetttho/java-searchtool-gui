 Hansen argues that the federal government brought the LDS church to its knees because of Mormon theocracy, not polygamy. This was a novel thesis when this book was published, but Hansen's view has since come under heavy fire. Jan Shipps, for instance, argues convincingly that polygamy was the marker of theocracy in the Utah territory, and hence the issues cannot be considered separately. Greg Kofford Books, an independent publisher of Mormon books, plans to reprint a revised and updated version of this work. It is long overdue. First editions of this work in good shape regularly go for over $100.
