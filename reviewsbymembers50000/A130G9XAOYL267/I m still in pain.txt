 This 21 minute EP contains some of the most brutal, insane, and complex metal ever spawned from the depths of hell. Lots of bands are heavy, lots of bands play fast, but no band combines speed, power and technicality like the mighty Meshuggah. This little suite treats the listener to riff after soul crushing riff with some of the best hardcore vocals in the genre. And then there's the the drumming. Oh my God the drumming!!! You can't exactly tap your foot to it, but it will expand your mind. This is what Metalica wishes they could be.
