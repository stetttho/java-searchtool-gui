 I bought this album, listened to it once, and put it in my "never to be listened to again" pile. Later, I listened to Destroy, Erase Improve at a friend's house, and eventually bought that album and loved it.  After D,E,I got old, I went back to Chaosphere and gave it another listen.  YESSSSS!  I was able to see what I missed the first time around. It's  simply too complex to appreciate on first listen, and maybe too bizarre to  serve as an introduction to the band. Buy Destroy, Erase, Improve first and  then, when you have an idea of what Meshuggah is all about, give this  masterful, incredible, impossible, brilliant album the careful attention it  deserves. Better, by far, than any other Meshuggah release.
