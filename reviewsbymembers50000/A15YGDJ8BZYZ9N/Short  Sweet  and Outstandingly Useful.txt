 If you're tired of having to wade through pages of blah, blah, blah to find real nuggets of wisdom and useful tools for self empowerment, then this book is for you. Jonathan has done a wonderful job of distilling the  wisdom from many self empowerment gurus and practices, and his own personal  and professional experiences, to present outstandingly easy to use and  powerful tools for success and happiness. All this in a book that's short,  sweet, and enjoyable to read. Its my choice as the best self-help book to  give friends and family as we enter the new millenium.
