 If you're a woman having a hard time with life...like the friend who shared this book with me...this book is especially for you. If you're a man having a hard time understanding life or women, this book is especially for you too! The stories of these women are riveting, as they take you through the lowest lows and highest highs of their life experiences on this planet. But best of all, these accomplished women show us how they triumphed over their adversities and healed themselves so they could create new lives of personal fulfillment and spiritual contentment. And those lessons are what so many of us need as we try to find happiness and fulfillment in these turbulent times. Highly recommended.
