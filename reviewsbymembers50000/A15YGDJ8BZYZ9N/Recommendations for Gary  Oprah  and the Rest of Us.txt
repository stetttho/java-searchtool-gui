 1. Maybe you liked Soul Stories, or part of it like I did. The first 132  pages were a great quick review of our soul's life journey, tailored for  the metaphysically challenged like me. But I much prefer Miguel Ruiz's The  Four Agreements, Alan Cohen's I Had It All The Time, or Wayne Dyer's Your  Sacred Self. 2. Maybe you didn't like Soul Stories, or part of it like I  didn't. The rest of the book on Spiritual Partnerships seemed forced, grim,  and sophomoric in its writing style. Gary makes it sound like a spiritual  partnership is a grueling climb up Mt. Everest roped to your partner.  Doesn't sound like much fun. I think a spiritual partnership can be fun,  don't you? Gary should read Stewart Wilde's Life Was Not Meant To Be A  Struggle, Alan Cohen's Joy Is My Compass, or Ariel and Shya Kane's Working  On Yourself Doesn't Work. 3. Maybe you wondered how someone could write two  books on spiritual partnerships and never discuss the magnificent spiritual  role and awsome spiritual power of the divine gift of sacred sex in an  intimate relationship. Maybe you would want to know why Gary only briefly  mentions sex three times in Seat of the Soul, and only as an example of the  bad addiction he had and you may have. Or only one time in Soul Stories,  and only in the context of sexual promiscuity. Maybe Gary should read Dr.  Victoria Lee's Soulful Sex, Margo Anand's The Art Of Everyday Ecstasy, or  Charles and Caroline Muir's Tantra: The Art of Conscious Loving before he  gives us any more advice about how to empower each other in spiritual  partnerships. No wonder Gary's descriptions of the work of spiritual  partnerships sound so grim: he never includes fun and sex!
