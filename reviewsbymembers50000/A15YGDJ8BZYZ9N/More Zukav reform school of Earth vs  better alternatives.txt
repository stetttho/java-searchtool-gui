 This book was sent to me by a dear friend. She's an intelligent, accomplished person with some major personal challenges...just like you and me and Gary and Linda. She liked the book, so you might too. Its first 111 pages are basic metaphysics shaped by the Zukav view of authentic power and life as Earth school, and now, emotional awareness. From that point on, both the psychological and metaphysical descriptions of how and why we humans behave are quite negative and questionable. Its the Zukav reform school view of life in Muddville...and there is no joy in Muddville or in this book. So do yourself a favor and read more enlightened and upbeat alternatives. Books like Why Your Life Sucks and What You Can Do About It, by Alan Cohen, and Excuse Me Your Life is Waiting, by Lynn Grabhorn, provide an upbeat path to our authentic power to create lives of celebration and fulfillment. Loving What Is, by Byron Katie, provides a powerful process for reframing and healing our most debilitating mental and emotional states. And in The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle simply and exquisitely gives us powerful metaphysical keys for a life of inner peace and joy right here and now on planet Earth.  What these authors are telling us is that attendance at the Zukav reform school of life is optional...there really are better alternatives.
