 An awsome, in your face but straight to the heart book by a master real-life teacher. Alan rocks you--not sucks up to you--on every page, challenging you to stop and change your life if it sucks in any way, and get a life that completely rocks. Alan covers ten basic reasons your life may suck in ten easy reading, but hard hitting chapters, with liberal doses of humor to boot. He loads each chapter with classic insights from great teachers from many traditions, and real world examples common to anyone's life. Alan also provides many great ideas of how to get you out of suckville. So whether your life completely sucks, or only sucks in an important area (like relationships or prosperity, for example), this book can be a powerful catalyst and guide to help you start living the life you fully deserve.
