 I love being inspired each morning by the selection for the day from this great book, plus Alan Cohen's Deep Breath of Life, and Daily Word from Unity. Joan goes deep to lift you up, with seed thoughts and suggested meditation and prayer practices for the day. If your life needs a lift now and then, I highly recommend this pocket book of daily miracles...and the other two too!
