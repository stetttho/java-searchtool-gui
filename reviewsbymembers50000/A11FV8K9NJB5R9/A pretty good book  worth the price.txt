 This book is useful for somebody who's had zero exposure to rural culture.  But, like most works in the field of rural ministry, it doesn't go deeply enough into the particulars of rural sociology, and it ignores the economic  aspects of agriculture.  It's not a bad book, but the definitive guide for  beginning rural ministers has yet to be written.
