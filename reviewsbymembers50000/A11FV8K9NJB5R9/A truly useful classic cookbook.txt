 This book is *amazing*.  It includes foods from all over the world, as well as a healthy dose of solid American fare, without the reliance on heavily processed, super-marked-up convenience foods.   And no bones about it: this book WILL save you money.  How many other cookbooks do you  know that tell you how to make your own breakfast cereal?  This one does;  in fact, it has several recipes, and the ones I've tried have all been  wonderful. The book has some incisive comments about the need to conserve  the world's resources which, though they date from another era, still stand  true today.  The "More-With-Less Cookbook" belongs on the  bookshelf of anybody who thinks a better world sounds good enough to eat.
