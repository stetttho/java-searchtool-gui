 I'd read most of this book before, in the magazines in which the columns originally appeared.  Reading them in book form, one after another, is different.  There actually is some sort of narrative advancement; one  learns about changes in the auto industry (and in the magazine industry)  from the contemporary point of view.   You either love or hate David E.;  this book gives you a surprising amount of insight into his personality,  but (since it's a bunch of reprinted columns) you don't really learn  anything you didn't know before.  This is a good read.  David E. is an  excellent writer who really ought to write a more-conventional biography.   *That* would be compelling. (I'll second a previous reviewer's suggestion  that  Patrick Bedard should do a book like this, and I'd pay good money for  a complete collection of Tom McCahill's road tests from Mechanix  Illustrated!)
