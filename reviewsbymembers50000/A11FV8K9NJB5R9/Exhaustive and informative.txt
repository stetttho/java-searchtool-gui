 This book is not for everyone.  Flammang and Kowalke have given us not merely a reference book, but a sort of "living history" of the American automobile industry's most challenging era.  It's great fun to track the changes in American cars from the North American Vinyl-Backed  Road Pigs of the mid-70s through the confusing transitional years of the  80s, on into the rebirth of the American auto industry in the 90s.  Reading  this book not only shows you how the way cars are built has changed; you  also get a sense of how the way cars are sold has changed. The reason  this book is not for everyone is that this is essentially an encyclopedia.   There's a section for every American automaker, and within those sections,  a section for every model year.  Thus you can learn what makes, say, a 1978  Chevy Impala different from the 1979 models.  Or you can read about the  travails of the Ford Motor Company in the late 70s and see how they dug  themselves out of a rut with their products.  Flammang and Kowalke have  done a good job researching this book and finding telling little factoids  to help illustrate where each company was at in a given year. This book  is also a boon to collectors, as it gives fairly complete production  numbers.  You can learn about ultra-rare body styles, option packages, and  the like. I've only got one quibble: the authors exclude any discussion  of "captive imports" (cars produced by foreign manufacturers but  sold with American names, like the Dodge Colt and Ford Fiesta).  I can  understand their rationale, but there are future collectibles among these  cars, and it's been a *long* time since the Standard Guide to Imported Cars  has been updated.  On the whole, though, this is a good book for any  hard-core auto enthusiast, and one of the best rainy-day reads I've got.
