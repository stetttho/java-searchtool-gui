 This book has an interesting concept.  Hagen interviewed ordinary people, collecting stories of their favorite cars they've owned.  Most of the cars turn out to be lovable old jalopies, and the stories revolve around how  reliable they were (or weren't). This book is really just for fun, but it  explores the relationship between cars and their owners in a unique way,  quite unlike anything else I've ever read.  The illustrations are  well-done, especially considering the rarity of some of the cars--where  does one find a photo of a 1947 Simca, anyway?   I'd like to see an  updated edition to see if people love newer cars the way they loved older  ones, but that's just a quibble.  Reading this book was a lot of fun, and  it made me nostalgic for all the old cars I've owned.
