 This book is certainly comprehensive, leaving almost no area of rural church life unexplored.  In my experience, most books on rural ministry tend to be either (1) sentimental and romanticized, (2) biased towards a  particular model of political activism, (3) lacking any non-theological  content, (4) about 25 years out of date, or (5) most or all of the above.   This book is different.  It assumes no prior knowledge of rural life and  ministry; it explores many of the touchier subjects like economics and  family structure; and it strives (although ultimately unsuccessfully) to  present both sides of the stories it tells. But it's clear the authors  are anything but neutral, being strongly biased towards  alternative/sustainable agriculture, and against agribusiness entities and  banks.   This becomes clear when the reader encounters the included  source material used to illustrate their points; most of it is too heavily  edited to include only items which either present alternative agriculture  in a good light or agribusiness/agribanking in a bad light.  There's  nothing wrong, per se, with this point of view, but  beginning pastors may  quickly find themselves in over their heads if they only take in the  anti-corporate, anti-bank point of view.  For that reason, I can't  recommend this book without some serious reservations.
