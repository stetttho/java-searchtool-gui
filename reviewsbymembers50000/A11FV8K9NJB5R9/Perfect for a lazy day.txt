 Gontiti plays a sort of Latin/Hawaiian/Japanese jazz fusion. That description sounds a lot more confusing than their music does.  The basic sound of this album is mellow and relaxing; they mix up-to-date electronic  sounds with the classic sounds of tropical music and Hawaiian-style ragtime  guitar.  This album is a little more mainstream than their previous works,  but it's still an enjoyable listen, and it's still very unlike anything  else anybody is doing right now.  Recommended.
