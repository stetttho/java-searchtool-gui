 Look, all I wanted to do was start eating more vegetables, and this book is getting me to do just that.  All the recipes are easy; very few call for ingredients I can't find in rural Nebraska; and, most importantly,  everything tastes *wonderful*.  Do NOT assume that only vegetarians will  find this book useful.
