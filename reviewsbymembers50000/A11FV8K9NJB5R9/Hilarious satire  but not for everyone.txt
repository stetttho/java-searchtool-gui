 If you're familiar with The Onion, you know what sort of mind-blowing, biting humor is in this book, and you know whether you like it or don't like it.  If you're among the many who were given a copy of "Our Dumb  Century" last holiday season, you have a pretty good idea of the  absurdist social/cultural satire you can find in this book, and you might  be interested in reading their take on more contemporary events.  If you're  looking for something that will make you laugh your head off, this book  *might* be it. I say "might be" because this book is not for  the easily offended--there's course language and graphic sexual content  that some may find objectionable.  If that's not you, buy this book and,  when you get it, go someplace where you can laugh out loud, because you  certainly will, and I mean repeatedly.  Don't get me wrong--I'm not  criticizing the content of the book.  It's just not for the faint of heart,  that's all.
