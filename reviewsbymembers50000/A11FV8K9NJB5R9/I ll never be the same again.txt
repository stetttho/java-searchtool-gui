 In a musical climate dominated by prefab R&B, or bands trying to cross Pearl Jam and the Eagles, or anonymous SoCal post-punkers, Guster is a breath of fresh air.  This two-guitars-and-congas combo brings just a touch  of worldbeat to their minimalist folk-pop.  "Lost and Gone  Forever" wanders through a lot of stylistic ground, from straight-on  rockers like "Barrel of a Gun" to the calypso-tinged "Fa Fa  (Never Be the Same Again)".  This album is full of catchy,  well-crafted and well-performed songs with an irresistable rhythmic drive.   I've never seen them live, but I can only imagine they'd be even better in  person.  Recommended to anybody who thinks there isn't anything new going  on in music these days.
