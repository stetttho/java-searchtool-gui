 What makes this the best atlas out there?  In a word, detail.  The National Geographic Atlas is the easiest to read, has the best city maps, provides topographic information, is spiral-bound so it will lay flat, and has the most up-to-date information about newly-opened highways.  There is  no other atlas that can compare with this one.  Buy it.
