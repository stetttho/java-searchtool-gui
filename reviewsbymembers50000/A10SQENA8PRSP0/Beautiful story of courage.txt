    If you are interested in China and the missionary experience, this is a book you must not miss. It is extremely easy to read, you'll finish it in no time!! If you have read about China this book may give you insight into one of the most remote corners of the country. It is also a story of incredible bravery and sacrifice to others.       I always believed the missionary effort in China had been quite hopeless, but reading this book made me see the way one "small woman" influenced so many lives, leaving a lasting impression and truly changing people for the better through patience and above all, a lot of intelligence.
