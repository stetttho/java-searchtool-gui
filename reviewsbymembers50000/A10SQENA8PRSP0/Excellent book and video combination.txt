 This book is a totally refreshing approach to makeup. In the style of Bobbi Brown, Sonia Kashuk encourages women to feel beautiful no matter what they look like. Her approach to makeup is natural, but does give you a few tricks on achieving certain looks (i.e. the smoky eye). She also is a little bit more relaxed regarding "makeup rules". Amazingly enough, the best part of the book is the video! I have bought many books on makeup (Bobbi Brown, Kevyn Aucoin, Linda Mason) and I have never learned so many new and completely natural tricks and techniques than from Sonia's video, it is amazing!!! I truly reccomend this book if you want to learn how to look perfect but not "made up".
