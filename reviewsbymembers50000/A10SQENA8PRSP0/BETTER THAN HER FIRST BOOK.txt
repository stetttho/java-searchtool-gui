     I find this book to be better and more complete than Bobbi's first book. It contains basically the same techniques, but presented in a different format. It is less restrictive regarding colors and makeup application and uses more real women for models. Also, the tone is less bossy, and I liked the aproach to makeup divided in several age groups. My guess is Bobbi read all the bad reviews on her first book and tried to improve it. Well, she succeded.      If you don't own her first book and would like to read something of hers, definitely buy this one, don't waste your money on both. This one is more complete and has better pictures. Whereas you might be a little uncomfortable with her way of speaking (don't do this or that...) you'll appreciate her advice in the end. After all, she did come to revolutionalize the makeup industry with her natural approach to makeup. Before her, the choice in foundation colors was very limited and basically pink-toned. She was the one who suggested women should wear yellow-toned foundation and natural blush (not the diagonal stripe along the cheekbone). Many people may not realize it, but the current trend to make makeup natural is here to stay and she brought it forward!!! Thank you Bobbi, because of you we see less mask-like pink foundation, less horrible blush, and even less brown liner on the lips! If you haven't changed the way you apply makeup n several years (or decades), you will love Bobbi. Also, if you are in a makeup rut and use foundation blush and lip liner in this way you should DEFINATELY buy this book and liberate yourself of the horrid 80's style of applying makeup. You'll be grateful for being able to show your most natural and pretty face!!
