 I honestly don't know why this Tom fellow described this film as "flat", he probably doesn't understand French or couldn't read the subtitles!!! This is one of he best films made in recent years. Stunning views, an excellent cast and a gripping story of love and courage. Catherine Deneuve is superb, still as beautiful as ever, and Vincent Peres gives a powerful performance. If someone did not like this film it is probably due to ingorance or too much exposure to fast-paced, superficial American productions. Don't miss it.
