 This movie is amazing. The most amazing part of it, it is inspired by a true stroy. The actors are superb and beautiful, and the theme heartbreaking. It comes to show one of the many faces World War II presented to people. It demonstrates how one event can alter a life in a dramatic way. I don't want to give away much of the plot on my review, because I saw the film in a theatre with absolutely no clue as to what it was about, and really could live in my own flesh every single feeling this beautiful woman was going through. Trust your instincts and watch it. This is the kind of film you will remember for the rest of your life!!!!
