 This book is absolutely dated. I was dissappointed by it. I realized the best part of it was the section on professional stage and photography makeup. The rest of it I found  to show looks that are completely fake and obvious (such as contouring and applying blush in one diagonal stripe below the cheekbone), very eighties!!! If you are looking for a book on makeup which you can use to create everyday and special occassion (but natural) looks, this one is not for you. I much rather reccomend the Bobbi Brown or Sonia Kashuk.
