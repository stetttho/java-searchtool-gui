 This book totally exceeded my expectations. I loved the fact that it makes French cuisine affordable for any cook, no matter what the level of practise you have had. The section on salads is particularly good, as it mixes very different ingredients, it even has some recipes inspired by Jean Georges experience of living in Asia so many years. So, what this book basically does is, simplify French cuisine in a really straightforward manner. The recipe for the warm melted chocolate cake is the best I have tried yet, totally foolproof. Buy this book if only for this recipe alone.
