 I loved sesaon two!!! From a critical point of view, the story in season one may be better, but I enjoyed season two much more because even though the suspense is still great, the story seems less believable (more James-Bondish style). I also know why they got rid of Jack's wife in season one; it was meant to add a different dimension to Jack's character (single, powerful and decidedly charming) thus giving the story a different twist, injecting it with the subtlest romance.  If you loved Jack in season one, you'll be completely head over heels for him in season two!!!
