 I loved this book, its "going from simple to sophisticated in one same recipe" format is amazing, really enabling you to practise with different levels of difficulty. It also gives room for improvisation and uses ingredients readily available in any supermarket. It is worth it alone just for Jean George's technique for cooking eggs, a total revelation!!! Don't miss it! The recipe on the cover is his most famous in his restaurant in New York. So if you don't have a trip planned soon, DO TRY IT AT HOME, it is amazingly simple and renders spectacular results. Your guests will be amazed. The only downside is, you will never want to eat eggs the old way again!!
