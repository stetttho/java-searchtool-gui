 I found this book to offer invaluable advice on choosing foundation color, applying blush and foundation. However, Bobbi tends to be a bit "bossy" and restrictive regarding some makeup techniques. For example, she "forbids" you to apply foundation on the eyelid, whereas I have found that foundation on the eyelid, properly applied and followed by powder, can make your eye makeup last much longer. If you like the natural approach to makeup, buy this book, but there is a better one in the market: Sonia Kashuk, Natural Beauty. If you have money to spend, buy both, but you will find that you will end using Sonia's advice a lot more than Bobbi's.If you don't want to spend a lot of money, buy Sonia Kashik's instead , for it includes an awesome video that will teach you more than any other book will!!!
