 Kevyn aucoin was definately an artist, but I didn't like this book. The makeup he presents is too obvious and fake. The pictures are excellent but he offers little step by step advice. The makeovers are great, in pictures. I would be scared to find someone with that much makeup in the street. This book is certainly missing the real-life/real-makeup element. If he was the master behind so many great looks on celebrities (i.e. Gwyneth Paltrow), why didn't he show us how to achieve their natural but polished style? Maybe he didn't want to give his secrets away!!!
