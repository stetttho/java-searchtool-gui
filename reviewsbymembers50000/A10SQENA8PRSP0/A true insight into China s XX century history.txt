  Beautiful! Poetic! Historic! Adventurous! This book is the most incredible and moving account I have ever read on China. It vividly describes the life of three women in the context of the tragic events that occurred during the XX century in China. Don't miss out on reading this incredible chronicle of historic events, this lively description of chinese customs and ideology, but above all, this moving epic on the lives of three brave women who dared to defy circumstance in pursuit of their dreams!
