 I usually don't watch action stuff, and so I was relentful of buying this series. However, I was surpirsed with 24!!! I loved the format. The story is absolutely compelling and the suspense is sometimes unmanageable!!! I also think this is the best season of the three on account that it is the most "believable" (but then again, who would have believed that sept 11 would happen?). I strongly reccommend anyone who loves series to watch this, you might even convert to the action genre!!!.
