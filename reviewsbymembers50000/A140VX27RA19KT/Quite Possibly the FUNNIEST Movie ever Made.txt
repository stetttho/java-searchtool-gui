 I would like to start off by saying this tape did not earn a 5 star rating from well executed direction or amazing acting. This is simply the funniest movie I have ever seen. It is simply horrible. The dialogue is so laughable at times. It sounds like a 20 dollar version of "Die Hard". I have one question, where was the editor when this movie was made? He obviously wasnt in the editing room because there are about 2000 things that are noticebly wrong. Ill go through some examples. There is a huge gun fight where everything in the room is destroyed, plants knocked over and chairs with holes in them. However, when they enter the room later in the movie, the room is spotless with everything in place. Also, when the "team" casually goes through the building shooting presidential body guards from 50 feet with straws holding little darts, he shoots on at a guard. You see it travel through the air and hit the guys hip, but the guy grabs his neck in pain and collapses. A really wierd one is when a member of the "team" runs at two cops with a table, he smashes them into the wall and goes to elbow a cop with no glasses on. When he hits him his glasses magically pop back on. Very Strange. All in all this movie doesnt warrant a $70 dollar purchase, but i definitly suggest renting it because I guarantee laughs if you have a sense of humor. A Classic.
