 Well, I must say, I am amazed. I will admit that I am fairly new to the melodic death metal genre but needless to say, its amazing. I heard In Flames first back in February of 01'. Theyve grown on me immensley, now I broaden my taste. I heard a lot of talk about DT but I wasnt sure. I decided to check out their most recent album, Haven. I had finally seen the light. Dark Tranquillity is only parralleled by In Flames. Their song writing ability, the care and energy in the music, the lyrics. Everything comes together amazingly. Dear god, this is music from the heart. The music is an amazing blend of hard chugging riffage, with that so incredible melodic guitar thrown in. The drumming is awesome, the double base in the title track is great. Also a new addition is the synths that were added. I love it, I think it adds a lot more power to the music. Stannes vocals shocked me. Dark, brooding, but strong and very deep. You can tell he loves what he does. Standout songs....how could I choose? I can seriously listen to this whole CD from front to back. From Wonders to Loss for Words. Every song is full of energy and is hard and powerful, sometimes even dark and brooding (Emptier Still, showcasing great clean vocals by Stanne). I do have 3 definity favorites however. I love the power of "Feast of Burdens". The riff that plays through the song is beutiful. The title track is what really cought me. The double base drum, the beutiful synths, guitar work, amazing. Also "The Same" captured me as well. The power he sings the chorus with is jaw dropping. Overall great song. This album is a masterpiece in my opinion. Im going to work my way backwards as I did with In Flames, Projector is next on my list. I cant wait to explore this band because they are definite masters at what they do.
