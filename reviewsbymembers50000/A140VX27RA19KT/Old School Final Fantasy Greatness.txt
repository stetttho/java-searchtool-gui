 Over the years Square has brought the best RPGs out to a system (exluding the Lunar series ^^) I havent played a bad Final Fantasy game yet and 9 did not dissapoint me. This game is simply amazing. The graphics are awesomely well done and the cut scene CG cinemas will leave your jaw weighted to the floor. The enviornments are lush and detailed. The amount of characters in a party has also been upped to 4 from the usual three. The story is also switched back to a medieval time, but of course you cant forget the semi-futuristic elements such as airships and giant steam powered cities (Think Final Fantasy 3). The story is simply engrossing. It will keep you hooked until you have beaten it with great twists and turns. I have 2 gripes that I have though. One, I think the main character, Zidane, isnt as memorable as Cloud, Lock, Squall, Cecil or any of the others heroes from previous games. Characters in the game are very well done. But Zidane I think was the wrong type of hero, just my opinion though. Character developement and backround in the game is awesome though. Square quality. The other gripe is the shortness of the game. I had the game for about a week and a half and I was at the 3rd disk. Maybe it was because I was hooked though =). My suggestion is by this game, everything about it is awesome and If you love Final Fantasy then this game wont dissapoint.
