 I saw this movie a while back for the first time and since then my family has purchased the movie, before that we rented it more times than I can remember. This movie definitly lives up to the quality of Vacation as it is completely hysterical! There are so many memorable lines in this movie youll be reciting them casually to friends and family. You gotta feel bad for Clark, why cant he ever have little fun with his family. The movie pinpoints just how stereotypical Christmas can be, and then shows how it can be if everything goes wrong. Great cast and Chevy Chase leads the group in a wonderful movie thatll have you rolling out of your seat. True classic and I urge you to pick it up!
