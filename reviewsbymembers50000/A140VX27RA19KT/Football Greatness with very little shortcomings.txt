 I received my PS2 for Christmas and 1 of the 3 games I bought was Madden 2001. I am an extremely big football fan and I played NFL 2k1 to death. Of course my first mission was to compare this game to 2K1 and when I first played the game I thought "Well, the graphics are awesome but whats up with the controls?". The controls seem a bit strange. For example, you can being a Wide Receiver and be holding "O" to sprint out, but once you catch the ball the sprint button is now "X". This will almost always lead you to spinning once you catch the ball (as "O" is spin once you have the ball). Maybe its me but when the players are at the coin toss, but they seriously look like midgets with big eyes. This is probably the only graphical dissapointment. The graphics are gorgeous. Everyting is round and smooth and even the side lines are detailed and 3D. Now one major concern is the ability to cut up. If you are sprinting up field and you see a gap to cut into, nope, it isnt happening. The game makes it almost impossible to cut because if so called "momentum". This is seriously annoying and frustrating. Another frustrating aspect is John Madden and Pat Summerall announcing. .... These are all minor and once you start playing you will find it is a seriously challenging and addicting game for every football fan. You cant compare this game to 2K1 because 2K1 has a more arcade feel to it. As a football sim and also as a fun party game Madden scores big and I highly reccomend it as a PS2 launch pick up.
