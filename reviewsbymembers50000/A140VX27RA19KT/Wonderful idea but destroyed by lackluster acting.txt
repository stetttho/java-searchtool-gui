 I had previously heard great things about this movie. I had everyone telling me how great the characters were and how great the action was. I decided to check it out. I was seriously dissapointed. First off I knew quite soon into the movie that it was going to be irritating watching this camera move around. I decided to let it slip by me and watch it. The movie than presents your average stereotypical cast which includes the strong hearted and strong willed women, the tough male leader, the confused kids, the "kill-off" extra members of the group, and the strange alien character who assists our heroes. This movie is plagued entirely by uninspired acting and you never really get a chance to enjoy each of the characters. The alien creatures were a great idea but you were never really presented with a chance to awe at them as they were avoided much of the time. What keeps it from 1 star is the main character was wonderfully portrayed and acted giving him an eerie sense about him but he was probbaly the only character that interested anyone. Rent it if you are seriously into sci-fi flicks but the casual movie viewer should avoid it like the plague.
