 I have read several reviews stating how the game was to overly complicated and too focused on graphics and not story. I have been playing RPGs for 16 years and I simply love this game. I was hooked to this game the minute I got it. The story will draw you in and wont be able to put it down. The storyline developes very well. The graphics are gorgeous and the cutscenes are jaw dropping. The absorb ability that is in place of magic takes  bit of getting used to and confused me through the first part of the game. But once getting the hang of it, it works pretty well. With interesting characters and non-stop action, I highly suggest this to any person who had doubts of this game before. just as good as IX ((I still firmly belive Final Fantasy III on SNES is the best in the series =) )) This game warrants a purchase!
