 I have to admit, "Clayman" was my introduction to In Flames. I had read a description of the CD and it sounded interesting. After downloading a few mp3 songs I had to buy this CD. In Flames definitly opened a new door for me in a musical sense. They blend hard chugging guitar riffs with an almost perfect sound melodic guitar. Stromblad definitly was sent from heaven because his riffs are so intricate and amazing. Anders Friden's vocals change erratically through each song, giving each one their own spice. One minute he'll have a high growl in for instance the track "Brush the Dust Away". Then hell get a deep growl more reminiscent of "nu-metal" bands, for instance, on the song "Pinball Map". Standout songs on this cd are near all of them. "Bullet Ride" is an amazing intro and the bridge near the end gets me so pumped up. The fast pace rules. "Pinball Map" is definitly a standout. Its fast paced with awesome guitar and an almost "happy" chorus with a nice chugging guitar. Another favorite is the ballad type song "Square Nothing". Stromblad shines here with this amazing begining on a clean guitar. The song ends up totally going all out. The title track "Clayman" is as fast paced as the come. The double bass drum is simply amazing and the song will get your blood pumping easily. This was my introduction but since buying it ive also picked up "The Jester Race" and "Colony", both amazing. Clayman definitly stands out and if you have any sense of metal in you pick this up because the music is amazing and I am definitly  a huge fan of In Flames now.
