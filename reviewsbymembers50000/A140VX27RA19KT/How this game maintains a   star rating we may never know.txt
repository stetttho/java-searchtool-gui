 I expected a lot from Sega as they have delivered on almost every account of the "World Series Baseball" series (no pun intended). Also with the Dreamcast finally deciding to show its true ability, I saw stills of this game and was in awe. This very quickly ended as I first played the game. Oh my god, yes the graphics are amazing. That is where it ends. Players are detailed and stadiums are replicated down to the upperdeck chairs. But this cant save the game. The control is quirky at best, batting is a real hastle. Hmm, perhaps defense will  be better. No, quite the contrary. There is absolutely no fielding whatsoever. The ball flys in the air and the computer moves a player to the spot then u decide which base to throw too. Sound like fun? Didnt think so. Lets go try another mode. HA! No extra mode for you! We are presented with exhibition and season. Oh well, lets try playing a season with some of our friends. Nope, cant play on the same team as a friend. With lack of extras, poor control and lack of it as well, and no team playing, this game avois a 1 star with its amazing graphics. This game is horrid to play and I strongly suggest playing Tommy Lasorda Baseball for Sega Genesis over this game. At least you can field....
