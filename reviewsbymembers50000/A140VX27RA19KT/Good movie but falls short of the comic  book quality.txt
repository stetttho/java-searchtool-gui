 Ive been a huge X-Men fan for quite a while. I imediatley though that it would be worth going to see, and invited my friend who is also a great fan of X-Men, more than me. But as I watched I realized something, not enough fight scenes. Fighting scenes have been an integral part of the series and I looked for a little more action in the movie. The final sequence was top knotch and gave me hope for the sequel. I also thought they left out some characters that could have bettered the movie. Gambit should definitly have been in it and Rouge didnt even act like Rouge considering she didnt fly or have super strength. She also looked like she was 15. The story is layed out well but I think the director came short in creating a true X-Men epic. Great special effects and good acting save this movie, I just think it needed a little more...
