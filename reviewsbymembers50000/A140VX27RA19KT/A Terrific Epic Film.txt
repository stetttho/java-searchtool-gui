 Gladiator is one of those movies that comes along and makes you watch in awe of how amazing everything in the movie is. The cinematography is amazing. Direction is dead on and well directed. Russel Crowe portrays Maximus, the emperor of Romes chief general who is betrayed by the prince which all leads up to the climactic final seen that is definitly on of the greatest endings. The cutscenes of the field and the gates give a surreal feel to the movie which makes it that much more enjoyable. The action is well done with not so much gore as Braveheart. This movie is definitly one for action fans, or anyone who loved Bravheart or Patriot. One of my favorite movies of all time. Buy it!
