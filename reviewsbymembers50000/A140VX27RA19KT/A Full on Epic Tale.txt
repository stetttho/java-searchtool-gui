 This movie is wonderfully directed by Rolland Emmerich. He does a great job of setting the backdrop and showing the effect of the revolutionary war on America. Benjamin Martin, a retired war hero raises his family until circumstances force him to join the struggle and lead an group of mercenarys against British General Cornwallace. All historical innaccuracies aside, as a film, this movie is one of the greats, maybe not the calibur of Gladiator or Bravheart, but good none the less, I highly reccomend this film to any epic film fan.
