 Back in my nu-metal days these guys were kinda intersting because they had a few interesting melodies that seperated themselves from other Rap/Rock bands. But since Ive gotten into the ultra heavy and talent filled genre of Melodic Death Metal, and only now do I realise the simplicity of bands like Linkin Park. Power chords fill up each song, with a constant use of scratching. The singer even pulls out boy band vocals on a few songs. Song structure is all too simple and the guitar work is 4 million miles from anything resembling something technical or difficult. Bass is hardly audible on any song. Yawn...
