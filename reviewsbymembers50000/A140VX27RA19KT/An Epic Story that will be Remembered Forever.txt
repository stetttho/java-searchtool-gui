 This movie is pure genious. The epic saga of William Wallace and his fight to free Scotland is an engrossing tale of love, betrayal and freedom. This movie will make you shed tears, laugh, and cheer. The battles are incredibly well done and incredibly gorey as limbs fly across the screen (Not litterally). The story has plot twists and elements that will keep you deeply involved in this 3 hour masterpiece. This movie easily ranks with Gladiator and Patriot but is my all time favorite movie. I reccomend it to anyone. This movie is easy to watch has beutiful scottish scenery. Buy it!
