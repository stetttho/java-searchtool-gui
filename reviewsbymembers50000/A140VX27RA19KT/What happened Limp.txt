 This CD is horrible albeit a few points. "Take a Look Around" is probably Limp's last great stand. But I think these guys have seriously sold out to MTV. Anyone seen the video for "Rollin"? Fred in a ballroom with girl dancers. Im sorry but this is to N'Sync or Britney Spears to be metal/rap. And yes, I did listen to the lyrics, but Im sorry. When Fred sais the "F" Word after every sentence, it gets pretty rediculous. 3-Dollar Bill was Limps best album and even Signifigant Other was good. But i think this CD really lacks power. Ill give props to Wes because he is in my opinion one of the best guitar players of any metal band today (aside from Kirk of Metallica). Unfortunately Limp will be praised by every TRL fan out there and this CD will succeed. Oh well....lets see where Korn goes.
