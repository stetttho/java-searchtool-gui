 I love wrestling, Ive been watching it for years. I have played every THQ wrestling game since WCW/NWO World Tour. I love them, me and my friends played the heck out of Wrestlemania 2k and expected the same greateness from No Mercy. When I first got it I was amazed. Graphics were suped up, ladder match is awesome as heck and the career modes are interesting. The Create a Wrestler is also very well done. A lot of options and there is also the "Smackdown Mall" where you can buy new items, arenas and characters. Also I dont know whats up with the bug everyone talks about. I have had the game for about a month and have not had it happen to me. BUt my main enjoyment of WM2k was Royal Rumble, and the insane tag matches for our "Titles" that I had with my friends. This game is amazingly and dissapointingly plagued by slowdown in 4 player modes. Now people will tell you turn off the music. It works to an extent but the speed is down considerably from one player (which is strangely blazing fast). If you play one player or 3 player and then decide to try out 4. Itll  make you sick. You can see moves coming to reverse them and you will get frustrated early on. This one reason soley gives it the 2 star mark down. This could be a perfect wrestling game if not for 4 player slowdown. Sorry THQ, see you next year. (Of course Ill be playing No Mercy until then ^^)
