 Hmm, this band is cought in a storm of metal fans. They are incredibly popular, and in part, are a lot more heavy the most nu-metal bands. But their mainstream appeal keeps any hardcore metal fan from actually listening to them. A few songs are actually somewhat heavy, somewhat catchy. "Wait and Bleed" has a nice melody too it. But several things plague this outing. Things such as constant rapping and sampling, things that dont really belong in a metal band. Constant cussing gets old after a while as well. Its also plagued by overuse of power chords. Nothing technical about these guys, the guitar players usually wail ont the bar power chords while the "extra percussion section", pounds with two drum sticks on some hydrolic drums. These guys arent the worst band in the world but they are far from anything mind blowing. Too simple and too rapcore, although many other bands do a lot worse. Iowa was much heavier and actually showed some maturity which was nice. Their first outing just wasnt good...
