 These guys are one of the few nu-metal bands that interest me. The vocalist, David Draiman is original in his style and thats refreshing. Each song is very catchy, heavy in some sections. There is a lot of rapping in the album that isnt exactly my taste but I enjoy songs on the album like "Shout 2000". Great remake of the Tears for Fears song. Very nice melody. Other songs such as "Down with the Sickness" have a great intro, with pounding drums, nice heavy riff, and a crazy break near the end of the song that you need to hear for yourself. Not usually my cup of tea, but I think these guys arent half bad!
