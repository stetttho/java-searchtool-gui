 I have yet to view the DVD version of this movie but I did see it in the theatres. This movie simply left me walking out of the theatre with my mouth wide open. The direction was wonderful and every scene had you on the edge of your seat. Once more, the theatre sounds perfectly creates a movie you can delve into. The eerie silence as they await the depth charges to strike, then the sudden crash of the explosion will make you jump and will make you feel like your with them. This movie is simple non stop action from begining to end. However what keeps this movie from being 5 stars is the fact that unless you have an amazing sound system, I dont think the movie can be fully realized better than it was on the big screen. Solid buy none the less. Highly recomended.
