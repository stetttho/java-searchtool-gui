 I have been a huge fan of the N64 first person shooter games. My friends and I played both Golden Eye and Perfect Dark over and over for countless hours of fun. But fortunately they have been 1 upped by a simply amazing game called Time Splitters. This was one of 3 games I got for PS2 and I simply love it. The graphics are gorgeous and the levels are amazing and huge. First I would like to warn that this game is a multi-player party game mainly. If your looking for a deep 1 player story mode this game doesnt have it. The 1 player mode is used to access more multi-player levels. These levels are every FPS gamers multi-player dream. Levels like the "Village" are stunning. The capture-the-bag mode is incredibly fun with you and some friends battling some Zombies in an all out war. The main part of the game that I want to touch on is the control scheme. If you have been playing Golden Eye or Perfect Dark for a year than you will simply hate the controls at first. I stress "at first". It is controlled by using the right analog stick to look and the left stick to move forward, back, and strafe left and right. But I got the hang of it after about 4 rounds of playing. Aiming up and down is still abit of a chore but these controls are perfect once you get the hang of them. After a while of playing you can even create your own level to play in Multi-player. While this is limited to a certain tile set and to indoors, it can break up the monotony of the other levels (which aren't very monotonous to begin with). The memory of how big the level can be is limited as well but I have created a 7 level capture-the-bag tower which i constantly play. This game is worth every penny and I highly suggest it to anyone with a PS2.
