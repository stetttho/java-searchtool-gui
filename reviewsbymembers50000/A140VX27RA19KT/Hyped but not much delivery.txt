 First off, this game is a graphical masterpiece. The graphics are ultra realistic. Watching Ryo run around and open doors, even fight, itll keep your mouth on the floor. However, I do emphasize "Watching Ryo..". The game is really more of a watch for 2 hours and play game. On top of that the meager tasks it asks you to do can be irriatating and sometimes not very directed. The fighting system is a down-sized version of Virtua Fighter and not very in depth. The free roaming aspect is very well done but the lack of story control keeps it from shining. The control scheme is also clunky. It takes a bit of getting used to but I found myself turning around when I wanted to back up and running when I wanted to talk. It uses the d-pad to move and the L button to run/walk. The analog control is used to lookaround. The story is somewhat nice, but is incomplete, a la Soul Reaver. Play to the end of the game and find out theres more to do, but in another game. Which means another couple months/years. I say rent this for a couple days and play it. It really isnt worth a purchase in my opinion.
