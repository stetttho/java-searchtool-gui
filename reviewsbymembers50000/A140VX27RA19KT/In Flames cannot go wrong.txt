 This was my second outing with the melodic death metal band "In Flames". My first being "Clayman" I was interested to see how the band matured from "Jester Race" to the aformentioned title. they have seriously matured a lot. While the band maintains that same melodic guitar from "Clayman", I noticed the vocals on "Clayman" are much more audible then on TJR. I definitly overlooked this and got used to it quickly because Jesper and Ljungstrom simply never cease to amaze me with their intricate melodies. The songs on this CD range from a celtic type atmosphere such as in "Moonshield", to pure rage and energy such as "Graveland". Standout songs on this CD include: "Dead Eternity", "The Jesters Dance", "Artifacts in the Black Rain", and "The Jester Race". One of my favorites on the disk is definitly "The Jesters Dance". Its soleley an instrumental and it is damn captivating. The music just sucks me in and the riff that begins and ends the song is simply amazing. "Dead Eternity" is definitly another top song which shows Flames rage and also it showcases the top vocal performance on the album from Friden and the music builds up giving the song an "Epic" feel. All in all this CD is a must by for any metal head. I guarentee you will not be dissapointed by any of the songs. The music is intricate and amazing enough in it self to warrant a purchase. The band comes together really nicely and I eagerly await March 7th when I plan on picking up "Colony", "Lunar Strain&Subteranean", and "Whoracle". This has become one of my if not my favorite band right now. I highly recomend them.
