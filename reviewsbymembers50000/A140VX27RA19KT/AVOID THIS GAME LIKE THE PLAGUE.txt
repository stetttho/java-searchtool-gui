 I am serious. This game is the worst wrestling game ever made next to WCW Nitro for Playstation but it ranks up there with it. This game has two modes, no endings, 20 Characters, no entrances lame move sets and looks like a really nice textured Smackdown. I suggest u rent it for a night and when ure ready to throw it out the window return it. THQ failed at making a game and im appauled at the way this games average review is 4 stars. THIS GAME IS BAD! And this is coming from a gamer of 20 years....
