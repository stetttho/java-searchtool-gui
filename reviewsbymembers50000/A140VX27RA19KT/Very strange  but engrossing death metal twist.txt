 Well I must say that I was shocked when I first popped in this CD. I am of course a huge DT fan and I knew that this album was made primarily of clean vocals. Well, from the first time Stanne sais "Another no-night...", I was hooked. This is definitly ground breaking stuff here. I will immediatly say Stanne pulls off these clean (and I mean squeeky clean, melodic) vocals very, very well. They mix entirely perfect with the mood of the cd. He sounds totally desperate while he singing and I think that gives the songs a lot more power. But man this guy can SING! But the iceing on the cake is that classic, great death vox are implemented as well. They also share a good chunk of the cd. Even DT trademark female vocals on track 3 (which generally isnt my cup of tea but I know some fans like it =P ). Music wise everything comes together very well. Jivarp pulls off awesome drumming such as in "On Your Time". Great, memorable DT riffs, provided by Sundin and Henrikkson of course, that will add to their list of illustrious songs.  Through and through this album is AMAZING. From the slow, piano intro to "FreeCard", to the pounding drums in "On Your Time". Personal favorite on this CD is definitly "Nether Novas". The death vox are very well done on this track, great mood and powerful riffs, and also the clean vox are done PERFECTLY. The song is so powerful, great song. Other great songs are "On Your Time", "FreeCard", and "ThereIn".  In the end, if your a DT fan, In Flames fan, Haunted fan, MELODIC DEATH FAN, you owe it to yourself to buy this album. While the clean vox may not be for the hardcore Cannibal Corpse metal heads, any melodeath fan who can appreciate great melodies, great guitar work, and great vocals will love this album.
