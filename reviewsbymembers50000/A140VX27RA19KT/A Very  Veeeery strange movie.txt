 This movie has an awesome premise and simply has a very surreal and eerie atmosphere to it. Its the story of a man who is ruled by his own posestions and must have everything perfect. He attends meetings every night so he has somewhere to go. He eventually meets Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt (who I might add does an awesome job of portraying this strange character). They create the "Fight Club" where people join and fight bare fisted for fun, not to the death. The Fight Club gets out out of hand and the world starts crashing down around the main character played by Edward Norton. The final twist is gonna make you simply drop your jaw and stare at the screen, then after the movie back in the box youll sit there for about 20 minutes thinking "How was that possible...." or "He was there but who was the other guy then..." Itll boggle your mind. Ontop of all that it is full of action scenes which get pretty gruesome. This is a top notch film and definitly warrants a purchace.
