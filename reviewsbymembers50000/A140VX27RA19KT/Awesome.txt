 Im probably one of the 10 people in America who owned the Sega CD along with Lunar and Lunar 2. I absolutely love these games. I have beaten the Original Lunar like a million times. Eternal Blue not as much beacuse it is MUCH longer but not any less fun. The story is way more in depth then the original and has many more twists and turns. It brings back a couple familiar faces as well although its set like 100 years from the original and I would have liked to see Hiro (the main  "Hero") become a Dragonmaster...but aside from that little story dissapointment it is awesome and worth EVERY penny. With all the extras im buying it day it comes out =).
