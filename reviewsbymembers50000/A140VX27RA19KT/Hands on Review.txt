 Without going through what I stated in my other review, I wanted to follow it up. I recently purchased this game (Even though I got my PS2 the day before). This series is a classic and simply one if not the best series in RPGs. Lunar SSS definitly widened the audience of for this game but I think this game will remain a favorite to fans of the series. First off, some of the added "bonuses" seem a little uneeded. Small pop-up Lunar paper pictures? Come on Working Designs....Although the Lucia pendant is actually pretty good size and nice. When I first popped it in, I noticed immediatly that the dialogue and cinemas were VERY similar to the Sega CD version. Also some of the dungeons are similar. For all you old school Lunar fans there isnt too much new here. The thing is anyone who played Lunar will pick up this game soley because this game deserves the devotion that it deserves and Is simply fun to play especially a cleaned up version. Not much else is new accept for some added cut scenes (Which are gorgeous as usual). There are no world map battles which seemed odd, but refreshing in a way. Instead, as in Lunar SSS, there are small mini areas where you fight monsters. This game is top notch RPG Greatness. I cant belive some people down this game because of its graphics. These I think are probably one of the games best qualities. I really dont get the same feeling with 3D flashy games as when I play Lunar. Lunar will definitly remain my favorite RPG series of all time and I will continue to play this game until I beat it. Buy this game if you love RPGs because this game is seriously underrated. I wait for the day that Lunar 3 comes out because I simply can't wait.
