 I guarentee most rock fans who first heard "Last Resort" liked it. I did anyway. I had hopes for this band but these guys are simply HORRIBLE live which sais a lot! They are incredibly off beat and the guitar players sound like my little cousin on his plastic Banjo. Maybe that was a little exagerated but they are seriously bad live which means they really need work in the studio, thats where they get the videos and make it sound so good. These guys also stole riffs from Tool and Limp Bizkit. Im not sure which tracks, maybe 4 and 5. These guys are unorignal and all around horrible band. I can see little 10 year olds liking this but they simply sicken me. Avoid this CD if you enjoy original hard rock beats. These guys are too mainstream to cater to the hard rock fan. They cater to what TRL wants to hear. Theyll be gone in a few months (I Hope)
