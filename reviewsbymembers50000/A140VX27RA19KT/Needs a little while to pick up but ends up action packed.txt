 The first mission impossible movie didnt really stick in my mind that well, and wasnt to great. When the movie started I knew this would be a heck of a lot better than part 1. But I was sent through a roller coaster of ideas before I actually settled down and got into the movie. The begining is action packed but seriously slows down for about a half hour with a lot of story build up. But I felt that once they were attempting the break in this movie seriously picked up the pace. The action scenes were simply amazing with stunts that were mind boggleing. This movie definitly makes up the begining with heart pounding action through the final half of the movie. The acting is superb and all the characters are believable. I also though Cruz did an awesome job of learning a little martial arts for the movie. This movie might not be watched over and over but I highly suggest you check it out.
