 This game is simply amazing. The graphics are detailed to the max (although the sidelines do look a bit goofy). The hits and player reactions are very well done. It has a lot of customization options such as create 8 players, a team, plays, etc. Simply amazing. There is also a Franchise mode in which you can coach your team over years and seasons. You can trade players and draft picks and sign college prospects and free agents. (By the time you get to your 6th year good luck on finding a winning season because Moss, Carter, Manning, James, Brown, theyll all be gone and retired =).) This game will definitly keep you and your friends playing through a season which is very challenging.      There are a couple gripes which keep it from 5 stars. One, you can block a punt every time if you line up on the outside of the left blocker. There are certain plays where you can pull all the DBs away from one side and just have a running back sweep out for open field and touchdowns. Also punt returns can be really easy if you just sweep from one side to the other. The multi-player game I dont play. I have played it and lag is horrible, sickening. Unplayable. Games like 4X4 EVO give me hope for Segas network (the online mode moves perfectly with no lag). NFL 2K2 could be simply awesome.     Finally, If you got a Dreamcast, pick up this game. This game will be the love of fans everywhere because there just simply isnt much wrong with it.
