 This may be the best complete set of Shostakovich symphonies period!  At the very least, I think everyone can agree that they feature the best sound engineering.  Listen to the percussion battery, which is so important in Shostakovich's symphonies.  I was literally blasted out of my listening room!  Barshai has excellent conductor credentials and was friends with Shostakovich.  His command of the responsive WDR is breathtaking.  I have listed to recordings by Jaarvi, Solti, Rostropovich.  These ears feel like they are hearing these symphonies for the first time.  I wish bargains like this could be had every day.  I think I'll buy a set for a friend.
