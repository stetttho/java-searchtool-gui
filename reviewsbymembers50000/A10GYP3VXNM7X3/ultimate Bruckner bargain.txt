 This is a steal!  An inexpensive little sampler of the same recordings relased by EMI (in a box set) of Jochum conducting Dresden's imfamous orchestra.  His pacing and the orchestra's phat brassy sound makes this a most enjoyable Bruckner experience.  Bargain hunters are treated with many great Bruckner buys.  In fact, many of the best Bruckner interpretations can be yours (inexpensively)!  Look for Skrowaczewski's readings on the Art Nova lable as well as Tintner's famous cycle on Naxos, featuring versions rarely recorded.  The Jochum EMI box above is also an excellent bargain along with Jochum's cycle for DG records.  Beginners to Bruckner should snag this bargain as a starting point.  All attentive listeners will be back for more!  Enjoy and may your spirit be moved to wander.
