 This fine recording combines the first albums of Boiled In Lead originally released in 1985 and 1987 on their Minneapolis hometown lable DeSelby Productions.  It was released on CD by Flying Fish Records in 1991.   However, Flying Fish has since gone under so we're very lucky that this  recording is still available.  The album primarily focuses on traditional  tunes, but folkies beware!  Boiled in Lead love to twist genres, even  cultures, into ecclectic refreshing arrangements.  Ballads may be augmented  with horn arrangements, dirges sometimes electrified with feedback, and  reels are throroughly rocked out with surprisingly fresh results.  This is  a great introduction to an outstanding group of musicians who forge brave  ground as they pass down wonderful tradition.   With two great albums on  one CD, its also a fine value.
