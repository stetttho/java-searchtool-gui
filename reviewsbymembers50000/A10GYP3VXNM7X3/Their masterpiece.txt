 While I've only heard approximately 50% oF Mecca Normal's recorded output, I believe this short, little LP is there masterpiece.  All 11 cuts are keepers and they flow remarkably well considering their broad range of  emotion.  David Lester and Jean Smith are at their best as Lester  improvises warped guitar jangles and thick power riffs under Smith's  affected nasal croon.  Smith's vocal venom is as lethal as another Smith,  Patti Smith.  From introspective and brooding selections like "Throw  Silver", "Cherry Flowers", and "Not Yet" to  bracing and electrifying numbers like "Held", "Once",  and "Flashlight", this album begs for frequent listens.   Particularly of note is "Clatter" which is one of my personal  favorites of the duo's fertile collaborations.
