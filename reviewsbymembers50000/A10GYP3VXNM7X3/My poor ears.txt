 This is my first attempt to listen to this album from start to finish with headphones.  I'm currently on track 8.  If the reader says "So what's the big deal?" then they haven't listened to this album.  Few survive  a Guitar Wolf concert without earplugs and some can't even listen to their  records without them.  All songs are great and horrible at the same time.   The shrill feedback may make one cringe but the chugging fuzz hooks produce  incredible gastric effects deep inside one's intestines.  Uhhhhhhhh.  My  personal favs are Missile Me and Link Wray Man.   Now I'm on track 11,  but I got to turn this off.  My ears feel like a piece of pig skin that has  been gnawed on by a dog for the last 20 minutes.  Time for some Bach.
