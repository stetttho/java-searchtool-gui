 Place this alongside Love's Forever Changes, Bob Dylan's Highway 61, Jimi Hendrix Electric Ladyland, the Byrds Fifth Dimension.  Of course, some may find the "worbble box" or whatever they called it, a little annoying since it appears on more songs than not.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, you haven't heard a full 13th Floor Elevators album.  What makes this album their masterpiece is the breadth of psychedelic styles exhibited in this rich sequence.  "She Lives", "Earthquake", "Dust", "Levitation", "Pictures" are wonders in rock craft.  "I Had to Tell You" is one of rock's greatest ballads, and "Baby Blue" is one of the best Dylan covers ever.  That's a lot for one album by a long lost Texas band with a singer who's broke and living in a nut house.
