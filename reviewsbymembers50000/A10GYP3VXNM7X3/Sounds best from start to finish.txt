 When this album came out, Ball of Confusion became my favorite song.  Boy was I surprised when I heard the song at a Temptations concert with my parents.  Now, a little older, a little smarter, this version sounds  somewhat silly compared with the power of the soulful original.  However,  this album still sounds great, particularly in headphones.  It moves nicely  from start to finish, covering lots of sonic territory.  While most will  listen for nostalgia these days, it still sounds fresh enough for  newcomers.
