 There were many more production toys available in the nineties than there were when King Tubby and Lee Perry were remixing Dub Plates.  So it makes sense that the form is thriving.  This collection focuses on rave/techno  artists, primarily from England, updating the sound of late sixties  Jamaican dub with today's technology.  The results are great for both the  dancefloor and the loungeroom.  The grooves completely fill all four discs,  totalling to 5 hours of music, making the set a great value.  The range of  dub styles on this set is extremely narrow, keeping the survey focused, but  slightly tedious.
