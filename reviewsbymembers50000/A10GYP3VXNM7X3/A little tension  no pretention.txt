 Delicate, youthful vocals strain to be heard above the controlled roar of guitars and bass, coming to terms with the horrors of running over a robin's egg with a lawnmower (Mower) or venting the frustration of a  missing mail delivery (Package Theif).  This is Superchunk.  Refreshingly  domestic.  Yes.  Rocking hooks larger than life.  Yes.  How can something  so simple be so great?  Listen for yourself.  Pick up a guitar and try it  yourself.  Its not that simple.  Superchunk just makes it seem easy,  probably by leaving out the pretention, but keeping the zest of tension.
