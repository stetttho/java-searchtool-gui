 This is the second annual sampler disc which promotes the Africa Fete concert held each year at Kennedy Center.  1999's festival featured blues performer Taj Mahal w/ kora player Toumani Diabate from Mali, Senegal's  Baaba Maal, ToumaniDiabate in Kora duet with Ballake Sissoko, kora player  Kaouding Cissoko, and Oliver Mtukudzi from Zimbabwe.  Each artist offers a  single from their latest album as well as a bonus track only available on  this release.  Its a great value!  All the artists are excellent and the  recordings are clean but not over-produced.  Enjoy!
