 Here's a great way to make a buck.  Take some classic old 78 rpm church hollers and barrel-house rockers and sync in some beats per minute and have people call you a break-thru musical genius.  I have to give Moby credit though.  At least he's introducing compu-teens and upwardly-mobile handshakers to the shakes and quakes of the old school yard groove.  When he keeps the field out of the studio, he creates some thoughtful moments, such as "Porcelain". And original collaborations like "Why does my heart feel so bad" shine as well.  Overall, the album flows nicely and makes a satisfying salute to the joy of music.  But has Moby changed the face of music?  At the very least he's learned how to program its soul.  My recommendation:  Buy this along with an Alan Lomax field-recording.  Decide for yourself if the tree trimmer has injured any of the roots.
