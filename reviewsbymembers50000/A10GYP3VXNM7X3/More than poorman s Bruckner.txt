 Tintner gave the world two gifts before leaping from his apartment window to his death in 1999.  1: He recorded all of Bruckner's symphonies, giving Jocum a run for the money as the top Bruckner conductor on record.  2. He  recorded his cycle on Naxos, which makes the set an affordable option for  budget collectors or an inexpensive second set for comparative  Brucknerheads.  The schrezo makes a beautiful tribute to Tintner, who  obviously struggled with the themes addressed in this haunting and  spiritual look at the mortality of life.
