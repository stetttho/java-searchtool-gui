 Perhaps the number one job of an artist is to provide the public with a complete picture of themselves and the world they come into contact with.  If that's the case, then Rob Pollard is a gem of an artist.  Listen and  learn what its like to be a school teacher dropout turned basement rock  star from Dayton Ohio.  A philosopher lubricated by American beer and  cigarettes, Rob weaves complex metaphors about simple ideas.  His band  cranks out big hooks over walls of tape hiss and missed cues.  By listening  to a do-it-yourself rock star, you as a listener, can become a  do-it-yourself revolter of the commercial music industry.  You may even be  inspired to quit your job or start strumming and writing lyric in your  basement.  My recommendation: buy the wax edition and dust off your  turntable.
