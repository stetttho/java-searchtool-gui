 Usually the goal of a discount compilation released by the label is to give listeners a just-better than average taste of their catalog.  They  compile good songs, but save their gems for those who purchase the entire  albums.  Here's a compilation of pure greatest hits.  If you own one  product from luaka bop, this should be it.  Its one of the best  compilations ever.  Every track is a gem.  If you've never heard Zap Mama,  Shoukichi Kina, Bloque, The Visible Man, Waldemar Bastos, Tom Ze, Silivio  Rodriguez, Susana Baca, Cesaria Evora, or any of the others, you are in for  a treat!  I'm going to have fun with this for years.
