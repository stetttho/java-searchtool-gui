 The overwhelming praise for this album written by Amazon reviewers caused me to dust off this disc and give it another spin.  Through most of the nineties I ignored Sugar, in favor of good ole' Husker Du and Bob Mould  solo when I needed a corn-fed buzz guitar fix.  However, a fresh listen has  brought me in agreement with the other reviewers of this recording.  Copper  Blue stands up to the best of the Husker catalog as well as his incredible  solo albums.  While I don't consider the album perfect - I find the  radio-friendly "If I Can't Change Your Mind" slightly trite and  "Man on the Moon" to be an arena-rock sing-a-long - I was brought  to teeth-grinding euphoria from the power of the first four cuts.  It  worked me up so much that the reflective melodies of "Hoover Dam"  were just the antidote to help me catch my breath for the relentless power  of "The Slim".  Thanks Amazon for helping me rediscover a  treasure.
