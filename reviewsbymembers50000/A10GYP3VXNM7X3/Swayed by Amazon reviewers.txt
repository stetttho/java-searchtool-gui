 I take more faith in Amazon reviewers than I do in professional critics.  So much so that I purchased this recording purely on the advice of those below.  It is an outstanding recording.  Take a full stick of pure power  pop, melt it in a half-cup of "Pet Sounds", add a few dashes of  psychedelia, and then shake it all up with some garage-mod inspiration and  you end up with "Jesus Hits Like the Atom Bomb".  This is truly a  pop record to carry into the next millenium.  It was said to hear that one  of the band members died in 1999.  Even if the band fails to recover, they  have left behind a little masterpiece.  Thanks to all the reviewers who  turned me on to this fine recording!
