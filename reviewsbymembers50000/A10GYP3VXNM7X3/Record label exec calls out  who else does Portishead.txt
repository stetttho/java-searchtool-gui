 The ultimate in one-hit wonder bands, Mono, with their epynomous song "Life in Mono" manages to ripoff the trip hop "Portishead" sound so convincingly that they were able to get themselves a major lable record contract.  Unfortunately, save for their hit single, the rest of the disc is a collection of throwaway clunkers.  True.  I'm not being fair.  I can't seem to get through about song five, so maybe there are a few keepers on the flipside.  After a few "numb"ers I'm usually ready for a small dose of the real thing, which is the self-titled Portishead album - a masterpiece in noir cut-and-paste beats with tragic, yet sulky not quite sauntry, vocals.
