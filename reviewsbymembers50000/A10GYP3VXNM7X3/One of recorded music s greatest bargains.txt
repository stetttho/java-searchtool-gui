 I bought this recording because I was looking for a sound version of Varese's Ionisation.  What I got was a wonderful version, perhaps the best, plus an additional 125 minutes of incredible 20th Century music!  This  bargain-priced two-disc set surveys three of the previous centuries most  exciting composers, Varese (French), Penderecki (Polish), and Ligeti  (Hungarian).  All works share one thing in common, they are all  extraordinarily ground-breaking compositions.  From the intense percussion  of 'Ionisation', the tense, paranoid strings of 'Emanationen' and vocal  extremes of Ligeti's 'Adventures' to the quiet beauty of Penderecki's  'Stabat Mater' and 'Misere', this recording covers a lot of compositional  territory.  And thankfully it provides great notes to help you along the  journey.  Now that we've left the 20th Century behind, perhaps its finally  safe for the world to explore its fine music.  Mahler's outstanding, but  aren't we ready to move on?
