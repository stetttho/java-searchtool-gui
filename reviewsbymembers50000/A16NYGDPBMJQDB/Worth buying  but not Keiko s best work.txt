 "As Far as the Eye Can See" and "High Brow Country Affair" both make me gag.  "Ruins of Sonora" has a Spanish trumpet thing going on that, while it was technically sound in its own right, just didn't jive with anything else I've heard from Keiko.  It was like a well-painted piece of the wrong puzzle.  I didn't like it.  Take those three tracks out of the album, and you've got the gold standard set by Keiko's other work.  If you're a Keiko collector, buy this album for tracks 1 - 4 and 8 - 10.  If you're thinking of trying Keiko for the first time, I recommend one of her other albums -- particularly Dream Walk.  For the rest of the album, I enjoyed it immensely and found it just as engaging as anything else I've heard from Keiko.  -sean henning
