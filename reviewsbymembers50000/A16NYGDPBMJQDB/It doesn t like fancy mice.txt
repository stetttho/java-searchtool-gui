 Pros:  Hotkeys make switching quick and easy. Comes with KVM cables. Supports audio. Can power itself off of the PS/2 ports, or use AC adaptor.  Cons:  Cable sprawl: this is a rectangular box with ports on three sides for cables.  Unfortunately, there really isn't an easy way to arrange the box and cables so as not to sprawl across your entire desk.  I recommend mounting on a wall to avoid "cable sprawl" eating up valuable desktop acreage. Compatability: doesn't like fancy mice.  Buy a simple three-button mouse with a scroll wheel, as this is as fancy as you can accomodate.  The MS Optical Mouse (B000068MP2) and the Logitech 3 button optical (B00004VX3T) both work fine.  The Logitech MX310 (B0000A1GOF - and I assume all of its big brothers and sisters) is not even detected. Audio static: connecting my speakers to this seems to produce audio static. Doesn't support multi-channel (3.1+) speaker systems.
