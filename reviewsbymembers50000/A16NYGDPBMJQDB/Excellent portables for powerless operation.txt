 I purchased these speakers for watching DVDs on my laptop while travelling.  Though I haven't had the opportunity to compare these to other portable speakers, I must say I was very pleasantly surprised.  These little speakers produce quality sound with no amplification (and therefore no plug-in or batteries).  I just connect them directly to my laptop's headphone port, set the amplification switch to "off/direct", and they're ready.  Don't mistake me; these little speakers will not suffice for in-home entertainment.  The bass is distorted and the mid-range is watered-down.  That being said, these are still more than satisfactory for watching a DVD or whatnot on your laptop.   Pros:  Portability.  Not the smallest available, but easily small enough for your luggage (about the size of four decks of playing cards). Power.  They don't need any.  You can insert batteries or attach an AC adaptor if you want, but mine produce acceptable sound with no amplification at all. Cheap.  For $30, it's hard to complain.   Cons:  No USB connection for the amp.  This isn't much of a gripe, considering these speakers are fine with no amp, but for those who want portable amplification, it would have been nice of Panasonic to include a USB connection. Sound quality.  Bass and mid-range are crap compared to any decent home speakers.  That being said, I imagine they're just as good or better than the competition in portable speakers.
