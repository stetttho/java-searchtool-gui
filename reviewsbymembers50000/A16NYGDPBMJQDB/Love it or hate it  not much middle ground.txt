 The ergonomics on this mouse are either wonderful or terrible, depending upon how you hold it.  Wonderful: If you rest your hand on it with thumb and pinky finger resting in the side grooves, it feels fine.  If your hand is the right size, this mouse becomes a semi-luxurious hand cradle.  Terrible: If you hold the mouse in pretty much any manner other than that described above, it's terrible.  A sharp edge running down each side of the mouse catches at your joints in a manner that is at first just vaguely irritating, and eventually (after hours of use) distracting and uncomfortable.  Test drive this mouse on the display shelf at your local CompUSA/Best Buy/Office Depot/Whatever.  Close your eyes and rest your hand on the mouse.  If your hand instinctively molds to its surface, don't waste time looking at other mice.  You've found your mouse, and you won't be disappointed.  If your hand does not immediately accept the position suggested by this mouse's design, move on and don't look back; you'll never get used to it.  Unfortunately for me, I fell into the latter category.  After about 10 hours of continuous use at work, mine went back to the store.  It's a shame, as this was otherwise a quality mouse.  -sean henning  PS - this mouse does not work with my KVM (IOGear MiniView Plus 2 port PS/2 + audio: B0000512HI).
