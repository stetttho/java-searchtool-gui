 Pros:  Available in four colors (beige, black, navy, silver). Flashy -- but not too flashy.  Nice red glow emerges from the underside, without the appearance that you gave your mouse ground effects. Smooth, rubbery scroll wheel; this feels comfortable under your finger, but doesn't slip when you roll it. Medium click pressure on first and second buttons.  Cons:  Click pressure on middle button (scroll wheel) is a little too high. Too little weight lends the mouse a cheap feel.  Overall, this is a great little mouse, and the price is unbeatable.  I am sad to report that mine began producing double-clicks on the left button when I was only clicking once.  This occurred after about a year of high (30+ hours per week) use.  For what it's worth, I have always been hard on mice, and this is the 3rd mouse I've broken.
