 I'm terrible at reviewing books for content, so I'll leave that to the other reviewers who have already posted here.  I would like to opin that the mechanical editing of this book, and sadly the Wheel of Time series as a whole, is careless.  The typical Wheel of Time novel passes 3 - 5 chapters between mechanical errors of the sort that can only be explained by careless editing.  Things like consecutive repetition of the same word, subject-verb agreement, obvious word misplacement or the inclusion of a word that was obviously intended for deletion are not things I would expect to see in a professional publication.  The types of errors routinely encountered in Jordan's writing would be marked in red on any high school english paper, so I'm surprised to find so many mistakes of such an elementary variety survived through several layers of professional editing and proofreading without being caught and corrected.  My apologies to all of you devoted Jordan readers.  It may be tempting to read what I have written above and tear it apart, but before you do, take a look at his books and see if you don't observe the same patterns as I.
