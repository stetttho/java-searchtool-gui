 Let me get the minor flaws out of the way first: 1.  Some minor video quality issues during the credit sequences.  Nothing that detracted from the experience of watching the show. 2.  Three "soap opera" episodes during which everyone wanted a piece of Claus.  The main plotline didn't advance much during these episodes.    Still reading?  Good.  Now here's the real review:  This series was heart wrenching, spectacular, triumphant.... words fail....  Last Exile celebrates everything that is good and noble in the human heart.  I loved it.  If you like drama, suspense, action, genuine heroism, or an unselfish love, then you will thoroughly enjoy this series.  Highly recommended.  No Anime collection is complete without it.  There's no point in trying to describe Last Exile; I can't find words to do this show justice.  Just go out and buy it.  You won't be sorry.
