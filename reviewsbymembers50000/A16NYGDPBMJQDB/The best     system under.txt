 This is probably the best 7.1 system for less than $100.  That being said, it's not everyone's perfect match.  If music is your main application, you might be happier with two top-notch speakers than seven decent ones.  Your music only comes in two channels, demoting those five extra speakers to mere clones of the first two.  For music aficianados, I recommend Logitech's excellent Z-2300 THX certified 2.1 system (B0002SQ2P2).  For about the same $$, you get much better mid-range reproduction, and surrender five unnecessary channels.  If your application is gaming, look no further.  In this price range, this is the system for you.  Turn down the lights, turn up the speakers, and you are _immersed_.  The steady drip-drip-drip of cave water in Neverwinter Nights is far more convincing when it seems to emerge from all around me.  If your application is watching DVDs, you could honestly go either way.  Ask yourself which is more important: faithful sound reproduction or immersive experience?  For sound quality, take the Logitechs (B0002SQ2P2).  For surround sound, take the Creatives.  Either way, you'll be happy.   Creative Inspire T7800 7.1 speakers:  Pros:  Lightweight satellites. 5.1 --> 7.1 upmix (for compatability with 5.1 sound cards). Handy remote control with power, volume, bass adjust, headphone connector, and alternate input. Slots for hanging the satellites on the walls.   Cons:  Mid-range sound reproduction is watery (though still better than average for a system of this price). The power switch/volume knob on the remote feels cheap. Only the 3 front satellites contain both mid-range drivers and high-range tweeters (the side and rear satellites contain only mid-range drivers). The cable ends are not terminated (bare wires). The cables are too short to trace around the floorboards to the opposite corner of even a small room.  Despite all of the cons, overall I am very pleased with the Creatives, and I would purchase them again.
