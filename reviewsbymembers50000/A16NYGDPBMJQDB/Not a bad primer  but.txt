 Lammle does an excellent job of explaining complex networking concepts (particularly subnetting) in terms simple enough for someone with no previous exposure to networking to understand.  Unfortunately, some subjects were oversimplified, to the point that I felt underprepared for the CCNA test.  If you are an excellent student, or you retain 100% of what you read, this book will get you a passing score on the exam.  For the rest of us, I recommend Wendell Odom's CCNA Self Study Certification Library (Cisco Press - ISBN 1-58720-095-3).  There's more to read, but you'll enter the exam more confident and better prepared.  -sean henning
