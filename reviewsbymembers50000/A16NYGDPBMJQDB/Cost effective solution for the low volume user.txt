 If you need an occaisional black-and-white hardcopy and have an intermittent need for color, this little printer is the cost-effective solution for you.  If you need anything else -- higher volume, cheaper consumables, or speed -- keep looking.  If you buy into HP's marketing hype about printing all sorts of photographs and whatnot, you'll be disappointed.  This printer really wasn't made to print photographs.  Can it print photos?  Sure.  Will they look like photolab prints?  No, but they won't look bad if you buy the expensive photo paper.  Is it worth it?  No way.  At $40 a pop for a print cartridge, your ink is precious, and should not be wasted.  Photo paper only adds to the costs, and the end product is a sub-par pic.  Best to leave that function to the dedicated photo printers.  Considering what this printer is designed for (controlling costs), it accomplishes its purpose very admirably (for the low-volume user).  It spits out sharp-looking text and graphics very quickly in black.  It's pretty slow if you add color, but remind yourself what you payed for the printer, and you'll understand why the sacrifice in speed was worthwhile.  If your volume needs are moderate or high, the cheapest, fastest ink solution is still too expensive and too slow.  Toner (laser) printing is the only cheap, fast solution for regular printing.  If that's what you need, a laser will pay for itself in what you save on time and consumables.  If you need both color and volume, you'll pay for it, but an adequate color laser can be had for under $500.  All of that being said, the DeskJet 712C very admirably achieves its goal (saving $ for the low volume user).  BTW, this is identical to the DeskJet 710 models.
