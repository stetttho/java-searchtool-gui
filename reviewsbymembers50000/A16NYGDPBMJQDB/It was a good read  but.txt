 I hate to be the dissenting opinion, but I found the novel a bit predictable.  I was expecting something mysterious, something unexpected, but I guess I've been spoiled by the tremendous volume of vampire fiction omnipresent in our culture.  I suppose by now it's all been done.  I suspect that if I read it again, it will improve with the rereading.  If I decide to read it again, I'll come back and edit this review.  -sean henning
