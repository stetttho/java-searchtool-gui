 If you need a cheap spotlight, you will not find a better deal than this one.  You really do get more than you pay for.  That being said, there are better lights if you're willing to spend a bit more.  Pros:     Very bright.  1,000,000 candlepower is not the brightest you can get, but plenty of light for emergency roadside repairs, finding something you lost outdoors, or just generally being a nuisance to your neighboors.     Stands on its own, and can be adjusted to several angles.  This is helpful if you are lighting up a work area and need both hands free.     Weatherproof.  Good for changing tires in a rainstorm.     Can be run from your car's powerpoint.  If you do this, I recommend leaving the car running, headlights off, hazard lights on; I imagine it will drain you car's battery almost as fast as it drains its own.  Cons:     Battery life leaves much to be desired.  Mine pumps out plenty of bright light for about 10 - 12 minutes, then dies.  That isn't long enough to do much work, or much searching, which seem to be the 2 primary applications of this spotlight.     Slow charge.  It takes about 10 - 12 hours to charge this light on the AC adaptor.  60:1 charge/discharge ratio on the battery seems a bit excessive.  -sean henning
