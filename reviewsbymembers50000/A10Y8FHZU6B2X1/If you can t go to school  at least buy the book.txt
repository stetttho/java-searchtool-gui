 This is a great, detailed description of how to "Go Faster!"  It represents the race driving theory taught in Skip Barber's 3-day school and will be helpful to anyone involved in racing at any level.  Nothing beats  the School's seat time you get under the instructors' watchful eye, but if  you want to understand the how and why of race driving, this book does it  best.  There are some great illustrations and commentary from the pros  throughout.  If you can only have one racing book, this sould be the one!   PS - it is a great refresher and study guide for those of you who have gone  to school.
