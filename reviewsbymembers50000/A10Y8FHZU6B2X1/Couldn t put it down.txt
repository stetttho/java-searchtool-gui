 I read this book in one sitting (which for me is a miracle).  I thought I was reading about me!  This book hits home for anyone in operations management, regardless of your type of business.  Although the book focuses on manufacturing, most business operations posess dependent events and statistical variation, which is a key element of TOC.  We are already implementing throughput improvements in our primarily construction business based upon the lessons learned here.  I also recommend Critical Chain, as it specifically addresses project management practices.
