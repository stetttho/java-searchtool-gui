 This is hands down the most clearly-written explanation of programing windows forms using C# that I have read or seen on the market.  Petzold has an easy and engaging writing style.  He takes the time to explain the WHAT and the WHY of what you are doing.  This is a great book for someone just sitting down to Visual Studio 2005 to begin learning C# programming.  His examples and walkthroughs produce useful and functioning examples of the most common aspects of Win Form programming.  My only complaint is that he can only dedicate a chapter to some pretty key concepts, like data-binding.  My interest is piqued, and then the chapter ends and we move on to new concepts.  This is a small complaint because what he does provide is complete and enlightening.  It provides a solid foundation to build off of create your own experiments.     I have worked through many programming books over the years (or should I say attempted to).  The Step-by-Step guides always leave me wanting more answers about how things work, in addition to how to make it work, and seem to be pretty superficial. This book has left me anxious to read more of Petzold's work.  He has skillfully broken through my thick head and can do the same for you.
