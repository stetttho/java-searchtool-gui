 Eli Goldratt demonstrates his genius both as a thinker and as a teacher with THE GOAL.  The operational concepts that he presents are revolutionary in their practicality and common-sense approach.  These concepts, collectively described as Theory of Constraints (TOC), have closed the loop for me on operational thinking and problem solving that has spanned my career.  We are taught, first as department heads, and then as general managers to focus on "productivity" in each area independently and "fix" each area in isolation of the other departments.  TQM and JIT began a revolutionary change in this thinking that linked the departments into chains and emphasized up-stream "suppliers" and down-stream "customers."  Where these fell short was in looking at the productivity of the entire "chain" and providing a problem solving method for continuously improving that productivity.  TOC provides a problem solving method as well as a management approach that drives ongoing improvement in any business. The business novel approach is very appealing as a delivery and teaching method.  Most of us struggle through the annual crop of dry business texts that are generally uninspiring.  This book is presented with a storyteller's passion for detail, while still driving the key learning points of the theory.  This makes sticking with it to the end much easier, which is important, as several key concepts are not revealed until the final pages. Every organization can benefit from the concepts presented in THE GOAL.  Implementation is not costly, unlike some other improvement "fads."  TOC shows you, the manager, how to focus on what is really important in your operation, in spite of your daily fire drills.
