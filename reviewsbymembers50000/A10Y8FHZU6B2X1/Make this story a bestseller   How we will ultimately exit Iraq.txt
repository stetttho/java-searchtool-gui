 This story is a must read for all Americans, especially those vocal, confused protestors who believe that we can just "pull out."  We are doing important and often frustrating work to rebuild a nation in the face of an armed insurgency.  All of us: American, the Iraqis, and the rest of the world are frustrated at the pace of progress.  This story takes you to the frontlines of this operation and exposes the reader to a slice of what is good and bad about our efforts to rebuild Iraq, and why progress is so frustratingly slow.  The President and our troops need all of our support to acomplish this mission.  As Rob points out in his summary, we need more "boots on the ground," not less.  We need to provide real security for ourselves, the Iraqi population, and the contractors who are rebuilding Iraq's infrstructure.  We need more men and women working directly with Iraq's civil government to improve living conditions and the economy.  Once security is achieved, many humanitarian organizations will come into Iraq and help.  Until then, it all falls upon the shoulders of the Civil Affairs teams.    Every American should ask, "How can I help these brave men and women better achieve their mission?"  Only through their success will we be able to bring our troops home.
