 This book starts with a great premise - the recounting of the career of the most successful German tank commander of WWII. That is where the great ends and misery begins.  Most of the text is generalizations about either German military life or campaigns of the LAH, with little factual account of Wittman's specific actions. Beyond the weak narration, the spelling and grammar are horrid.  This just compounds the feeling of frustration. I am (angry) that this book ever made its way into print. Where is quality control?
