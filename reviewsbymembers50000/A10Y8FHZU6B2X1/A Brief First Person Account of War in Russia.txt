 3 stars - The book is brief in content and lacks the detail that Forgotten Soldiers or Soldat present in their accounts of German life in the front lines of WWII.  Nevertheless, it does present some interesting vignettes of battle and some description of tactical actions that the anti-tank teams used to defeat the formidable Soviet T-34 and KV tanks.   These descriptions were the best part of the book.  The rest is more of a personal retrospective that adds little to our understanding of the German soldiers' perspective or predicament.  The personal experiences off the battlefield seem almost to be filler material. I recommend the book in that it is short and easy to read, and the tactical descriptions of anti-tank warfare are helpful (if you are into that sort of thing).  However, don't expect too much - if you have read and enjoyed Forgotten Soldiers, then this will disappoint you in its lack of detail. Borrow the book if possible (if it was a movie, I'd reccomend waiting to see it on video or even TBS vs. paying full admission at the theater).
