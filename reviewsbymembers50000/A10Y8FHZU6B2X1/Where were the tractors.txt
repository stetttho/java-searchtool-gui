 I enjoy reading Mr. Welsch's tractor books, often laughing out loud (and driving my wife crazy).  I enjoyed the anecdotes about friends and females, but missed the tractor stories.  Maybe it has all been done?  I think not.  The problems overcome and the lessons learned in "Old Men . . ." and "Busted Tractors . . ." were rich in both amusement and (some) educational value.  This book, unfortunately, left me empty at the end. Funny stories, but a little too much on the "Love and Sex" part; and yet, in some ways, not enough. Read it, enjoy it, but don't expect as much as his first two tractor books.
