 Thanks for your clear and engaging stories of your experiences in Iraq.  Like many of the other reviewers, I couldn't put it down and finished reading it in less that 24 hrs.  I bought the book because I was looking for more descriptive information about what was happending in Iraq.  The newcasting, when it discusses the war, is so superficial, and tends to focus only on bad stuff and body counts.  I don't think many Americans (including myself) really understand the true nature of our ongoing efforts in Iraq.  I am grateful for an unpoliticized work describing what was going on there in 2003-2004.  I am hopeful that many of the deficiences in leadership, supply, and war-fighting material have been corrected since that time.  This and other timely stories (see "WAGING PEACE" by Rob Schultheis) point out that our troops need more support and more troops to ensure the success of the mission.  Only then can we bring them home.
