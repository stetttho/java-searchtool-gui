 We have a simple wireless network at home with cable modem internet access and we use two of these NICs to for my wife's and my work laptops.  I also have a wireless network in the office (using 802.11a technology), so when I get home I pop out the office NIC and pop in this NIC and it works great.  With the associated router and access point (Siemens SpeedStream Wireless DSL/Cable Router (SS2624)), my wife and I can both sit in the living room and access the internet without wires, etc.  It is great and now we don't have to "share" the internet connection. ;-)  Actually, it is good because we both work form home a lot and this allows us to stay on top of e-mails and access resources on the net.  I recommend this network for its ease of installation and operation.  Truely plug and play.
