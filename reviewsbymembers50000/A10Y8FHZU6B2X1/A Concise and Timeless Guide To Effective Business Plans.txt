 With this book as a reference, several years ago my MBA team was able to take our B-plan to 2nd place in a national scholastic B-plan contest.  I have referred to it annually since then to guide my on-going planning.  I also use it as a playbook for developing new business plans.  It helps focus your planning efforts on the key questions that investors want answered in a plan. Each chapter addresses an aspect of the planning process and gives anecdotal examples of plans that were presented to the MIT forum.  The summaries at the end of each chapter help expedite the annual review. I cut my teeth on Mancuso's various B-plan guides almost two decades ago and this book, by far, gets you where you want to go in the most direct manner.  If you only want one book on B-planning, this is it.
