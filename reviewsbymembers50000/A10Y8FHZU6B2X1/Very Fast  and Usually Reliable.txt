 In our office, we have a network with this access point  and four of the associated wireless cardbus adapters (SMC SMC2735W EZ Connect 802.11a).  It is very fast and works great for most applications including accessing data and file server with no speed issues.  Occasionally the most remote users loose their connection to the access point and that can be frustrating, but they are over 60 feet away and separated by three interior walls.   Is the extra speed necessary for internet access - no, but for heavier file and data sharing applications, it helps.  The rated speed is 72 MBPS, but it does degrade over distance, through barriers, and during other random times.   We are happy with this network solution - it was easy to install and configure, and saved us the cost of installing a wired network in someone else's building.
