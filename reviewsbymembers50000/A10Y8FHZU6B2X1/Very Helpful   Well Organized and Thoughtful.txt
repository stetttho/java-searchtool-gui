 There are a lot of books about facilitation skills and techniques.  This is one of the best because it is well organized and thoughtful in its presentation.  It is very theoretical and does help an exerienced  facilitator zero in on areas to improve, but is also useful to the beginner  by providing a good framework to work from.  The key to success (like so  many things) is practice.  This is a good guide to get you started on the  right foot and to use as a reference over time as your facilitation skills  develop.
