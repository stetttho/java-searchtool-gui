 This book maintains solid research and well thought out arguements, while being fun reading. Of all the modern books on the historical Jesus, this is both the most scholarly and best written. My only criticism is that which has already been mentioned: you have to read the text in the chapters and again in the endnotes (which are at least as long as the chapters) to get the full value.
