 This is a short book. The words are chosed as carefully as a Haiku poem. There are many excellent works on the holocaust (Primo Levy's expecially) but this goes beyond most to capture the feeling of a chilling event that even our souls dare not see. There are books with more details, more facts, more stories, more agony; but this stands out as probably the best I've read for capturing a moment in time.
