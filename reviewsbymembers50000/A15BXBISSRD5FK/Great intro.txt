 I've read most of the books on After Effects. This one stands out for clarity of instruction. Unlike many of the others, this is both broad in its coverage and it avoids the "just do this" that a lot of introductory books have. It explains the reasoning for picking certain keyframes and has an especially good coverage of 3D space in After effects. It is an introductory book, however, so you will find little on rotoscoping, only introductory information on expressions, and no coverage of keying, image stabilization, or advanced masking.
