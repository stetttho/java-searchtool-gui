 Unlike the other reviewers, I do not see the author as polemic or unfair. He provides reasonable arguements to back his claims. Perhaps he is somewhat harsh on Marcus Borg, but his arguements with the Jesus Seminar are certainly shared by many others (such as Meier). There are only two criticisms I would have: the writing is not as engaging as authors like Meier or Vermes and the book's value primarily would be to those who have read a fair number of the texts he references. To get a picture of Jesus just from this book and biblical accounts would be a mistake.
