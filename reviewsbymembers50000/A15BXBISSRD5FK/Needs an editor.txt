 I was pleasantly suprised to see that this book is published by the Department of Defense. Many similar books published by Paladin press devote an inordinate amount of space to their author's political diatribes (Plaster's excellent but somewhat dated Ultimate Sniper is an exception).  This book has a wealth of information, but is devoted exclusively to the M24 Army sniper system. It has no information on older scopes (like the ART scopes), nor on the Marine M40A3 or even Army modifications like the 300 Win Mag. Some areas are too brief (like the lack of mention of problems with accuracy if the scope is has one zero and the focus adjust is changed to a different yardage).  Where the book falls short is in editing. Not only did they pick the most butt ugly fonts, which they compress and resize line by line (from around 11 to 14 points), making reading slow, but almost every page has typos, spelling, or punctuation mistakes. The figures look like they have been copied from an old mimeographed version, and are sometimes almost impossible to figure out what they are showing. Some of the figures are mislabled (like two that reverse iron site pictures with scope pictures). Some are inaccurate (like the windage mirage for 1-3 MPH wind). Some tables are way off (like the windage adjustment for different MPH winds) - though a page or two before gives accurate formulas. There is no index and some paragraphs look like they were pasted twice at different places (like the adjustment of 1 MOA for 20% humidity changes).  Regardless of one's political leanings, most of us hope that our military is not sloppy. The editing of this book makes me wonder about how much precision is valued. That is curious in a book on sniping, which is generally read by people who place great importance on precision.
