 This book is well written and scholarly, but has a definite Mahayana and Tibetan bias. For instance, the assertion that reincarnation and states of future existance (hell beings, hungry ghosts, etc.) is fundamental to all Buddhist groups is not true. The docterine stems from a 1200 AD Cambodian text, and there are Buddhist discourses that warn against debate on reincarnation (with arguements about the implicit assumption of a self or soul that may lie in this belief). The other Very Short Introduction to Buddha is less biased. For a better introduction, I would recommend Rahula's What the Buddha Taught.
