 This is an interesting book, but starts with the premise that the Gospel of Thomas provides some insight into original words of Jesus. This has certainly been hotly debated, and many scholars (such as John Meier) give solid reasons to doubt the premise that it is based on material that predates the other gospels. However, a greater criticism is that there is no voting data on the words. If 30% of scholars in the Jesus Seminar voted red, 19% voted pink, 10% voted grey and 41% voted black, the text would be listed as as black - inauthentic. There is also no discussion of how the various criteria for authenticity were weighted in coming to conclusions about authenticity for each passage. Personally, I would weigh some of the criteria as more important and convincing than others, but this information is not given. The book, therefore lacks sufficient information to aid the reader in coming to their own conclusions and gives only the conclusions based on democratic votes of its members. I do not think that contributes to understanding of the issues.
