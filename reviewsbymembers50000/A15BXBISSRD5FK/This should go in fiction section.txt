 It would be helpful if the author based what he writes on some facts. For instance, he said that the years between Jesus's teenage to his mid twenties were spent with John the Baptist, yet he doesn't even attempt to show how he came up with this idea. He minimizes the reality of miracles and looks almost exclusively at the spiritual meaning. However, the gospels state that many were converted through his miracles. If one compares this with Vermes book, Borg's, Wright's, or (especially) Meier's books on the same subject, this book comes up short on credibility. Other authors at least give some arguement for their views.
