 Version 1.5 of Premiere Pro is much more stable than previous verions. Its menus are intuitive and its features extensive. Particularly strong are the ability to move back and forth with Audition (for sound editing), encore (for DVD creation), After Effects (for adding special effects and animations), and Photoshop (for static picture editing). It is missing some features found in Final Cut Pro (like being able to assign multiply, screen, overlay, lighten, etc. modes to clips), but if the video collection is purchased, there are easy workarounds using other software in the collection (like after effects). Unlike Avid Xpress Pro, it is PC only, so those who plan to share files with MAC editors or who plan to upscale to a high end Avid system - might look at Xpress Pro instead.  Its 24P support is more flawed than either Vegas or Xpress Pro. Hopefully this will be fixed with a patch in the near future.
