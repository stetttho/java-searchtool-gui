 The Bruch was recorded c. 1970, a period when Rosand's technical polish and personal style were a nearly perfect amalgam. The impulse and drive in these performances, especially the Bruch, are tremendous. The orchestra support is better than the usual Rosand received. The live recordings are clear and relatively quiet considering their provenance. I'm less sanguine about the Paganini; thus the four stars overall. Buy it for the Bruch, which easily holds its own with Perlman and reminds me even more of Heifetz.
