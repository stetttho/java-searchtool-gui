 Rosand is splendid in both masterpieces of the violin literate. First honors go to the Beethoven: fast and eloquent, it cuts through years of interpretive detritus that have slowed the "average" interpretation into treacly grandiloquence. In the late Heifetz mold, Rosand maintains a driving pace, but without the hyperactive edge. Inouye provides great support --- the Monte Carlo is not merely well-rehearsed, as has plagued Rosand in past productions. Very good rendition of the Heifetz cadenza. The Brahms is also blessed with quick tempi and the artist's deep appreciation for the work. I've heard him play it in rehearsal with the San Jose, and I must say that this was much more compelling. Things get a little ragged in the cadenza, but overall, this comes close to the immortal Milstein's Capitol recording. And that's high praise indeed.
