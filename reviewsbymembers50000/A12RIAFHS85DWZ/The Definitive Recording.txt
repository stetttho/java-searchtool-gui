 From my review on Classical.Net.  If you weren't able to land EMI's six disc set, this single recording can almost redeem your oversight. The Caprices are the capstone of Rabin's art; the performances, assertions practically, are fervid to near boiling. While the technical miracles - and there are many - reveal Rabin's fantastic fingers, the most rewarding thing on display is his natural musicality, which infuses every phrase with life. Mandatory.
