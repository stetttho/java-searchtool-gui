 Argerich certainly leaves nothing on the table here. Even after reading numerous reviews of these performances, I was not prepared for the velocity and attack that hit me. Now, after several hearings, I feel I can record some observations of these amazing live documents. First, it *is* possible to play the Rachmaninoff 3rd too fast. I never thought I would hear a performance that achieved this, but I think Argerich goes beyond even the ideal fast tempo, so that the movement (alla breve) loses character, suffering mostly in the weight of the chords and the decorative notes. My reference has been the Wild/Horenstein recording: Wild's tempi are faster than most, but his greatest achievement is in the power with which he builds to climax. This is particularly telling in the shorter cadenza (also played by Argerich), where he creates tremendous tension without resorting to stunts (i.e., playing as rapidly as possible without regard to musicality). To Argerich's credit, I doubt that Wild or even Horowitz could whip through octaves and scales at such speed. So the experience is unique, even if you feel like you are sitting under the bigtop. The Argerich approach works much better in the Tchaikovsky, where the naturally impetuous music caters to her flights. The scherzo in the second movement passes in a shower of sparks! For me, this recording is much more competitive than the Rachmaninoff as a legitimate realization. Van Cliburn is much more stylish and regal with the same conductor, but she makes his tempos sound pokey. The listener must decide. For connoisseurs of utmost virtuosity, speedfreaks, et al., this is definitely recommended. Interesting that Bryce Morrison's liner notes call her a tigress --- the animal metaphor can be extended to her technique (superhuman or not human) and ultimately, to her lack of sympathy for the music.
