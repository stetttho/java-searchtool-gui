 I am in the Michael Rabin camp as far as the Caprices go. Perlman communicates with a wider audience because of his suave tone and elegant style. However, in pieces that are mostly about adrenaline, Rabin has the full-out technique that wins the day. I do like that Perlman adds the extra octave to the final arpeggio of the 24th. Certainly worth hearing!
