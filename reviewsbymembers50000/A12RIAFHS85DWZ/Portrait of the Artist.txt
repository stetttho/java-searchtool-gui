 The repertoire in this program, particularly the Scriabin, shows Horowitz at his elemental best. Horowitz's principal trait, as former student Byron Janis so aptly puts it, is his "divine inconsistency" - the gift of total nervous control at the keyboard wedded with a prismatic tonal palette. The mercurial soundscapes of Scriabin's etudes mesh perfectly with Horowitz's own flightiness. He whips the "Affannato" Op. 42., No.5 into a storm, the siren line of the arioso borne over volutes of seething bass notes. Amazing! The second half of the recital is dominated by the blockbuster Rachmaninoff Sonata #2, recorded live in Carnegie hall.The sound is very good. Essential fare for inveterate romantics.
