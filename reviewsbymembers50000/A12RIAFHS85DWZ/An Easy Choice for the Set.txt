 I don't know of a complete set that approaches this one. Kocsis is competitive in Nos. 1 & 4, but his emphasis is primarily on velocity. Wild shows tremendous bravura in the cadenzas of both 1 & 3, managing at times to sound like two pianos. He seems emotionally engaged throughout --- certainly Horenstein gets the most out of orchestra on the big tuttis. Great acoustics and sound quality for the period. I would still buy individual recordings, such as Richter in No. 2, but this is one to build around.
