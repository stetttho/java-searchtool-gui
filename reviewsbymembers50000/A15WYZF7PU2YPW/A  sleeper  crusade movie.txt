 This is a good movie.  Its flop at the box-office may have more to do with contemporary theatre economics than production values and storyline.  The acting, cinematography, costumes, sets and music are outstanding.  It is a different angle on the crusades. No, it's not pro Muslim, although it does provide useful glimpses of their viewpoint.  It's not particularly pro Christian, either; it shows that all Christians were not of one mind when it came to ruling the holy city.  The leaders of both armies, espcially Saladin, come across as decent men dealing with a complicated situation.
