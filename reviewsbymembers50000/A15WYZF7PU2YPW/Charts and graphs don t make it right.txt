 It is often quipped that a "Washington expert" is no smarter than any other expert, he just has better slides.  "The Great Divide" builds on this point.  This is a shallow, superficial campaign book, not a serious study, that sells for nearly $40 to cover the costs of its multi-colored graphics.  It purports to look seriously at subsidies while overlooking some of the largest and ignoring the fact that these subsidies are pushed with great enthusiasm by such Republican stalwarts as Tom Daschle, Kent Conrad, Tom Harkin, etc.  It is a polemic or a diatribe.  Save your money.
