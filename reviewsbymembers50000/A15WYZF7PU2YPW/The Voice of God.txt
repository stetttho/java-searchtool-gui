 I was driving to the airport at 4:30am in a heavy rain storm. I didn't see the flatbed truck when I enterred the freeway.  He skidded and jacknifed and I saw the back-right corner of his truck coming straight for my side window.  My whole life did NOT flash before me but I thought about the police notifying my wife of my death and about all that would follow.  The tons of metal and steel stopped just short of my window but close enough to hit my rearview mirror. As I calmed down, or tried to calm down, I turned on the radio.  Rather than the usual popular music, the station was playing religious music in the wee hours.  The most beautiful sound I've ever heard came through the speakers.  It was just a lone woman's voice singing without accompanyment.  I was ready to go straight to the radio station to determine what it was but the announcer saved me a trip.  It was Bobbie Wolgemuth singing "O Sacred Head Now Wounded" from the "O Worship the King" disk of hymns.  Most of us grew up learning this tune as "Because All Men Are Brothers" by Peter, Paul & Mary.  I believe it originally came from "Saint Matthew's Passion," an 18th Century choral work. Ms. Wolgemuth's song stilled my beating heart and gave me a sense of peace I've never experienced.  I am not a religious man but the beauty of this music convinced me that there must be a living God somewhere.
