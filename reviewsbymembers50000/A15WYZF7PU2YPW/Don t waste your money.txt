 This is a thrown-together paste-up that wouldn't receive a C grade at a backwoods high school.  There isn't enough good information here so the editors resort to useless lists of nuclear facilities (like power reactors) to fill pages.  It is poorly editied with many typos.  It is built around several news articles that can be accessed for free by simply typing the phrase "Dirty Bomb" into Google.  Penguin has some nerve charging $12.95 for this.
