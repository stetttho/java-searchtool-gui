 I'll have to begin by agreeing with the prior reviewer, who termed this book "thoroughly magnificent."  It is all that and more.  As a WWII buff, I'd always meant to read more about the prior war but didn't do so until a review of CASTLES OF STEEL caught my eye.  It's author has a writing style that makes reading easy and enjoyable.  This is what I call a "fireplace book" because one can just sit and read for hours on end.  The only other historian to have that effect on me is William Manchester.  I probably should've read DREADNOUGHT first but I'm definitely going to read it now.
