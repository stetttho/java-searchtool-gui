 The weak leg of military history is that most of it is so badly written.  This book is in that tradition.  I've no doubt it is well-researched and factually accurate but the author has taken enough information for a magazine article and stretched it into a hardcover book.  It is endlessly repetitious and tedious. Much of it is speculation on what MIGHT have happened. I don't think I'd buy this book again.
