 I have diabetic vision problems and thought the Laser 6000's capacity to magnify small areas of the screen would be useful for maps, data sheets, etc.  I've decided to return it and get a larger monitor instead.  This mouse moves eccentricly and you move over the page or screen in fits and starts.  Once you turn the magnifying function on, it can be quite difficult to turn it back off.  In one case I had to reboot.  Lastly, it screws up some other functions like delete and highlight.  It's a great concept and I'll try subsequent versions when they come out but this one ain't ready for prime time.
