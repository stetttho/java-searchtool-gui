 I was recently asked which year in the 20th Century I would choose to live and why.  I said "1940" with the rationale that this was the great turning point in history when the values of western civilization might've been lost.  They weren't lost because a single indominable man stood firm.  Had the newly installed PM, in May-June of that year, sided with Halifax and the other peace seekers, Hitler would have won.  What followed would have been just mopping up. Gretchen Rubin succinctly illuminates this great man in a new and fresh format.  She writes extremely well.  This is the perfect first or second book for a reader just catching the Churchill bug.  (Following Manchester and Gilbert) It belongs on any short list of Churchill books.  One hopes Ms. Rubin won't stop here.
