 Flash Gordon is as hokey and entertaining as he was half a century ago but the folks who put this package together were lazy.  There are a dozen or so individual Flash Gordon episodes on each disk but there are no "breaks" between them.  If you watch three one night and want to pick up where you left off the next day, you have to start the disk all over again. There is no way to go straight to the next episode.  You have to repeat the episodes that preceeded it.  This is simply lazy or slopy on the part of the people who put the package together.  They don't deserve your business.
