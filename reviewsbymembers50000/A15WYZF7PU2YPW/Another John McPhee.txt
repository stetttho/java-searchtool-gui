 I've read everything by John McPhee and wondered who would take his place.  I wish it were me but I don't have that kind of talent.  Trevor Corson does, though.  His "Secret Life of Lobsters" is part Sebastian Unger in "The Perfect Storm" and part everything McPhee ever wrote.  It is well-written and informative and as entertaining as some pot-boilers.  Anyone interested in lobsters, Maine, the sea or just good writing should order this book today.
