 This is a great film and I would highly recommend it to anyone. It's a fairly accurate account of the Battle of Algiers. You really get to see the ugly side of war. However, the movie was financed by the Algerians and if you read Alstair Horne's Savage War of Peace, there are some inaccuracies. First, the movie shows Algerians shooting police. But Horne's points out that most people shot were civilians. Second, the film appears to attribute Ali's death to French explosives. But Horne claims the large explosion was due to a hidden cache of bombs planted by the Algerians. Finally, one of the film's heros Yacef Saadi may be one of the real scoundrels. The films shows an unknown, torture victim to be the one who revealed Ali La Pointe's hiding place. According to the book, The Battle of the Casbah, it was Yacef Saadi who revealed Ali's hiding place. He revealed it freely, without torture. In fairness, Yacuf has denied the charge. So this is just a warning to keep a critical eye open: the film may be slanted in favor of the Algerians.
