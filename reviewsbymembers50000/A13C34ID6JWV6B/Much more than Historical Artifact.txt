 I discovered this book when I read Roger Kahn's Flame of Pure Fire, the book about Dempsey's reigh as heavyweight champion. What I learned in the book and subsequently was that Dempsey may be described as the first modern boxer. Dempsey knew what he was doing. He had superior knowledge about how to punch and defense. This is clearly demonstrated in the destruction of his opponents Jess Willard and Luis Firpo. Both were much larger and presumably stronger men (Willard outweighed Dempsey by 70lbs!) but Dempsey had vastly superior skills. This book discloses the wealth of knowledge Dempsey had about the physical skills of boxing. Dempsey teaches that real punching power comes from tight, short punches that utilizes the body's leverage. Dempsey shows also the bob-and-weave style that he invented and was later employed by both Joe Frazier and Mike Tyson (In fact, Tyson modeled himself on Dempsey, including shaving the sides of his head as Dempsey did for his fights). So I would highly recommend this book for its historical significance and as a learning tool.
