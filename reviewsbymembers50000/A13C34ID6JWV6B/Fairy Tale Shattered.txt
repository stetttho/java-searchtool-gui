 I'm very surprised this movie hasn't been release on dvd.  Many of the reviews already written do a good job of explaining the movie.  I would only add that to me the movie is about too lonely people each with their own illusions, about themselves and the other, which are shattered within the small confines of a dimly lit studio apartment.
