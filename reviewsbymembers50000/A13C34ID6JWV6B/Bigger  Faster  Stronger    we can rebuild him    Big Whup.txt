 Testosterone dreams is a thought-provoking study at times of how a drug, or at least the promise of a drug, changes our attitudes about what is normal and expected in humans. Testosterone has been offered up as a enhancement for athletic performance, sexual drive and slowing the aging process. Heavily promoted by drug companies (just watch the commercials during golf tournaments), the public begins to question acceptance of normal human limitations and imagines an improved world. Soon these enhanced expections become the norm.   I believe this is what the author is getting at. I have to admit while the book was thought-provoking at times, other times I kept saying to myself "so what?... The author should just relax and not take himself so seriously." Ignoring the point whether the drugs actually do what's promised, every invention sets forth the same process of altering people's expectations. I can't say I finished this book and thought I learned something despite some interesting observations.
