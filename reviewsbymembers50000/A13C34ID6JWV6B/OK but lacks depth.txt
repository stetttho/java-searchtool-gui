 I bought this videotape because I like boxing and heard this movie was one of the best boxing movies ever made along with "Raging Bull". The movie was pretty good but lacks the artistic depth of "Raging Bull". In fact, the movie really isn't even about boxing but is a straight morality play. The boxing is incidential. In the movie, the characters are either good or bad, with little grey, except for the Garfield character. Of course, good triumphs and the hero gets the girl. This makes the film a little boring on both an intellectual and emotional level. Anyone more interested in boxing, and being challenged intellectually and emotionally, is better off with "Raging Bull".
