 This is Metallica at the height of their powers. This is absolutely their best album and arguably the best metal album ever. There is no filler here. The songs are a very sophisticated and intelligent but are also very raw. Some have complained of the production quality but I think it enhances the listening experience. The flatness of the sound, due lack of bass, enhances a sense of starkness and immediacy. Unfortunately, this album has been Metallica's apex. I think Metallica abandoned some of that sophistication and rawness for a more commercially appealing sound.
