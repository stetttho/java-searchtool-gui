 The Black Album is Metallica's equivalent to the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street: a very good album but the end of Metallica's edginess and creativity. I was a huge Metallica fan in the 1980s from the time they released RTL. Metallica was different from mainstream metal bands. They were creative, edgy, angry, even a little frightening . I got a kick out the reaction I would get out of pop music/hair metal fans when I played Metallica - this combined look of repulsion and confusion. All that disappeared when you see guys who listened to Bon Jovi playing this album. Back then I detested this album as a total sell-out. A typical reaction of a Metallica purist. Today I'm less harsh. There are some great moments on this album, especially "Sad But True". But there are moments that foreshadowed Metallica's decline. Overall, this is a very good album but falls short of the greatness of Metallica's earlier albums (with the exception in my opinion of "Kill Them All").
