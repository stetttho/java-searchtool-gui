 GRIZZLY MAN is an ode to an incredible fool.  I use the label "incredible fool" for both the admiration I feel that Treadwell managed to live 13 summers with grizzly bears and experience a raw closeness to nature few 'modern' people have known and, the sheer disbelief of how foolish he was coming into so close proximity to such dangerous and powerful animals.  Herzog manages to capture the beautiful, the sublime and the absurdly stupid in this absolutely fascinating film.  There is something about Alaska which beckons to some people a call to both higher ideals and elemental existence - a utopia of nature.  Treadwell heard that call and it gave his life meaning but it ultimately destroyed him (Chris McCandless in INTO THE WILD also heard a similar call and also died tragically).    Treadwell is a likeable fellow but is also filled with his own narcissism that he's on a special mission to protect the bears.  His life becomes more and more a role in his own film and further rebels against outsiders who don't agree or understand him.  This role leads him to believe that he can ward off aggressive bears but tragically learns that he can't.  The one point I disagree with Herzog's commentary in the film is that Treadwell believed nature was harmonious - a Disney-like world, and this lead to his self-destruction.  Treadwell acknowledged he could be eaten by the bears so it appears he didn't see nature as so harmonious.  I think a better explaination is that his years of success or own narcissism prevented him from taking proper measures.  Or perhaps Treadwell was suicidal and would rather die a martyr in his utopia then deal with life's ordinary lessons of failure and disappointment.
