 Though the book is important for putting some blotches on the Ali sainthood, overall I think the book is the jealous rantings of a bitter man. From this book, and from interviews I've seen with the author, it's clear Kram hates Ali. But more than a personal dislike for Ali, Kram seems thorouglhy jealous of the popular adulation for the man. The book is an effort to so discredit Ali that others will share Kram's disdain. In short, this is Kram's axe to grind. Kram gives Ali's remarkable talents grudging acknowledgment and has absolutely no sympathy for the man. (If Kram was political, he would probably be a fanatical Clinton-hater.) So what terrible wrongs did Ali commit to deserve such treatment by Kram? Personal vanity, making fun of Joe Frazier, and not defying the Black Muslims on the draft (Incidentially Kram, the BMs murdered Malcolm X, do you think that might have influenced Ali's decision?). Valid points yes but not worth spending a good part of your time writing a book about. There is more acrimony is this book than in several volumes I've read about Hitler or Stalin. In conclusion, reading this book is very difficult: not b/c of the "truths' it reveals about Ali but b/c bile doesn't taste good.
