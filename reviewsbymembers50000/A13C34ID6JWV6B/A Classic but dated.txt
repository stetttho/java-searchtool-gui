 I bought and read this book about ten years ago. I used it to start a weightlifting program. There is alot of good information in this book. However, the book is somewhat dated. As I learned from other serious, competitive body builders, there is too much training advised in this volume. Even people who juice don't train this much - and you don't have to to achieve great results. For example, Dorian Yates trains alot less than what Arnold advises in this book and he was Mr. Olympia for a number of years. Consequently, you better off purchasing a more recently published book.
