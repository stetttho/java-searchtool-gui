 This is the best book on boxing I've encountered. The author does a good job of explaining technique and providing drills for exercise. However, ANY book on boxing will be inadequate for learning how to box. Good boxing skills can't be learned from a book - just the way you can't learn to dance well from a book. To physically know how to box you need a trainer and you need to get in the ring and spar. To master the techniques, it must feel right. You acquire that feeling by watching your trainer and having him/her correct your mistakes. You have to be physically next to that person (Anyone who's learned to box or dance will tell you this is true). You polish those techniques and gain confidence in using them through sparing. Yet the author does deserve credit for putting out a fine book.
