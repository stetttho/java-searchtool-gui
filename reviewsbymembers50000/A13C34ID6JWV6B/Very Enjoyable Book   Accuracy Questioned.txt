 As a work of fiction, I found this book to be incredibly enjoyable to read. I love the mixture of horror and comedy in the book. It shows two totally different aspects of human beings which is what life is really like.   My one caveat about the book is that the author may lead one to believe that all the horrors in Peru were caused by the Shinning Path rebels.  However, international groups estimate at least half of the deaths were caused by the government and other right wing paramilitary groups.  This aspect of Peru's history is absent here.
