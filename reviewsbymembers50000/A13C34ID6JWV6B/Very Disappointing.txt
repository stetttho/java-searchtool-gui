 I'm a big boxing fan and a big fan of Don Dunphy. I really looked forward to hearing these fights. However, I was very disappointed. The poor sound quality is excusable - you have to use the material that's available. What's not excusable to me is that only the highlights of the fights are presented. Instead this CD seems to be a promo for Bill Cayton. Before and after every round there is an announcement that this recording is brought to you by Bill Cayton. Someone should just put the entire recording of the fights on CD. That's what anyone really wants to hear, not constant promos.
