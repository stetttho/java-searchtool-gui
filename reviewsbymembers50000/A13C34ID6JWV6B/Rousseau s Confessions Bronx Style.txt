 One cannot help but admire the unflinching honesty of Jake La Motta in his autobiography. This book isn't merely a self-serving recounting of La Motta's rise and fall as a boxer. Instead, La Motta creates a geniune classic. There is no air brushing here. La Motta reveals the deepest, darkest secrets of his life: his murder attempt, raping of a virgin, his impotence, domestic violence etc. As a result, one begins to understand his fears and the utter rage that drove him as a boxer. LaMotta also helps explain something about boxing - that mixture of beauty and violence. La Motta's own honesty is the redeeming quality that delivers the book its greatness. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
