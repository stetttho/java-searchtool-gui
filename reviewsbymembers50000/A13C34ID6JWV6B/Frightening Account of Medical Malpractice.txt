 This is an incredible story. Thousands of people had their brains mutilated and personalities destroyed in a grand experiment to cure schizophrenia and other mental disorders. What's so incredible is that scientists and physicians, principally Walter Freeman in the book, advocated this procedure based on theories of the brain and mental disorders without much evidence to support their claims. In fact, the theories are almost an afterthought to justifiy the procedure. I'm absolutely amazed at the breathtaking irresponsibility of the medical and psychiatric communities allowed this to go on. Valenstein starts the book by tracing the history of physical "cures" from water treatment to electroshock therapy.  What Valenstein proves is that lobotomy is really just another attempt by the psychiatric communitiy to apply specualtive theory and boldly experiment on human beings. This was possible because serious mental disorders, like schizophrenia, seemed hopeless. The medical community and public was willing to try anything. In this context, Valenstein explains the driving forces that helped lobotomy to gain wide popularity: the medical profession's willingness to try anything and uncritical acceptance of advocates' claims of success - even giving the inventor of the procedure a Nobel Prize; the media's fascination with strange medical procedures and the almost universal blind acceptance of doctor's claims; and finally, the public institutions' desire to save money - lobotomized patients were released from institutions or were easier to handle. As a layman, I assume scientists are objective and critical thinkers and, doctors are humane heroes - "to do no harm". This book demolishes those illusions and keeps your skeptical mind razor sharp.
