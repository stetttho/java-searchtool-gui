 This book is an easy-to-read and thoroughly entertaining critique of psychoanalysis attempt to treat schizophrenia and autism through talk therapy. Though largely anedotal, Dolnick presents a strong case that psychoanalysis is speculation cloaked in scientific garb. Instead of utilizing a rigorous method of testing their hypotheses, psychoanalysts seek confirmation and try to fit observable phenomenon into their pre-existing schemata. The audacious arrogance of Freud and his followers made them immune to contrary evidence and resistant to other methods. Moreover, Dolnick suggests that psychoanalysis feeds into the self-aggrandizement of the psychoanalyst: they are the all-knowing interpreter of their patients; they are in the privileged position. With this sort of foundation, it is no wonder psychoanalysts were able to reck havoc on parents of schizophrenic and autistic children. Without any basis in fact but only through the deductions of their own schemata, psychoanalysts condemned parents for causing schizophrenia and autism. Some through willful fraud, others through self-delusionment distorted their own success rate. To admit mistakes, would render their enterprise vulnerable and knock them off the pedestal they place themselves upon.   I don't understand some of the criticism of Dolnick's tone as "sarcastic" and "depressing". Maybe Dolnick does have a bit of an axe to grind but what better service to grind an axe with than in these incidents. These psychoanalysts caused more problems than they solved. They condemned parents for something they weren't responsible for and gave these same parents a false sense of hope that they could help their children.
