 Zagat Survey is a very valuable resource for locating good restaurants. It's well worth the investment to buy the book then guessing whether a particular restaurant is good or not. However, one criticism I have of Zagat's is that they are very biased toward French Restaurants or Frenchified restaurants. It seems that a Chinese restaurant that serves food in a Frenchified way gets a higher rating than one served in a more traditional setting. This is disappointing because each culture brings a different eating experience to the table.
