 There are some aspects of this film that were outstanding. The wrestling scenes are the most realistic I've viewed in a movie. The movie gives a good account of the sacrifices it takes to be an accomplished athlete. Finally, Jimi Petulla's performance as the father and coach is very touching and memorable.   However, other aspects of the movie seem to be right out of an ABC Afternoon Special. Danny Mousetis's role as the son was unconvincing. I don't want to give away scenes but the son seemed much too mature, much too good, for a conflicted 17 year old. It appears that the film writers wanted to create a likeable character but in doing so, left something important out. Other characters, especially the mother, seemed flat - as if little thought was given to develop their character. There were some scenes that I thought I've seen right out of the Afternoon Special.
