 This biography is a pretty good straightforward report of Marciano's life. The author develops an intimate portrait of the champ, warts and all, through interviews with friends and acquaintances. We get to know what it was like to interact face to face with Marciano. In one sense, it's refreshing to get unanalyzed picture of a subject. But sometimes I wish author delved deeper. My only criticism is that the author doesn't really add any value to the subject, Rocky Marciano. The book lacks psychological insights into Marciano's personality. The author gives a report on the Rock's actions but doesn't penetrate into what made him tick. At several points, the author acknowledges that some of Rock's actions were a mystery to him. But one would expect after writing a book on the guy the author could provide some answers. I understand I'm contradicting myself here but my judgment oscillates between enjoying the straightforward, unadulterated portrait and the need to understand the subject in some deeper sense.
