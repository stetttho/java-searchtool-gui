 This disk has been in my CD-player for a week! The music is energizing, catchy and has that fantastic combination of innocence, flirtiness and exaggeration that brings the days of burlesque into your livingroom. If you want to strip for your partner without seeming sleazy, just popping this in and walking to the music will give you the inspiration you need. You'll know what to do after that. But there's more, it's so cute, upbeat and out-of-place in your daily life it's a great pick-me-up before work, calms your potential road rage, and brings out good cheer even after the worst work day. If you like to smile, treat yourself to this little number.
