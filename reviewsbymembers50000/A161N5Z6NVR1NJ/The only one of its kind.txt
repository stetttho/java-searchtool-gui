 This does for Exotic Dancing what Gio's "How to Strip for your Man" did for Strip Tease. It brings exotic dancing into the mainstream in a humorous, professional, non-threatening format. Unlike "How to Strip for your Husband", which is geared more toward the timid housewife, it targets women of different backgrounds, confidence levels and age groups. Although it is designed for women, with some adaptation men can use it too. Just do less groove and more aggression.     It starts with how to walk with confidence and grows from there. You won't learn how to twirl around a pole, or anything, but who has one in their house, anyway?       The moves she teaches can be used for private seduction to spice up a marriage or drawing the attention of a "target" at a club. They are adaptable to many types of music and can be combined with other dance styles. In particular, she teaches several ways to become aware of how sections of the body can be moved independently, such as the torso and hips. Some of us had to take bellydancing and hula to get that right, but I think with her visualization techniques almost anyone can get it in a few tries.    A few notes: 1. This tape is a low-impact dance HOW-TO tape, not an aerobics tape, so you will have to do your own warm-ups and stretching (especially the calves and lower back if you're really going to get into this and practice). There is a cool-down at the end, though. 2. If you have lower back pain from an injury, you may want to tone down the hip stuff, but if you get lower back stiffness from sitting or standing at work, it may actually make you feel better.
