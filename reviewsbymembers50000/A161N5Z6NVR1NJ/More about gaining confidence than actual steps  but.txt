 For women who already do wild and crazy things for their husbands, you don't really need this. Just get some music and start practicing. You can get all your moves from a movie or a Bettie Page video. This is more geared for the ABSOLUTE beginner. If you know it's something you want to do, but you have  no idea where to begin, you haven't danced in years or you need a little confidence, this video breaks stripping down to fundamentals. The three women have average bodies, they're not Showgirl material, which will make this less intimidating for many women. The examples given don't involve any fancy flexibility and are very low impact (physically!). You won't get any awards at an amateur contest by following these routines, but I have yet to meet anyone whose husbands aren't pleased by a stripping ambush. I was disappointed that they didn't mention the value of a little humor, a mistake many marital-help videos make. A lot of women don't surprize their husbands because they're afraid of being laughed at. The "experts" should realize the best cure for that is to make the ambush funny. Nothing breaks the tension of your first strip tease better than fake hillbilly teeth or a bra stuffed with a couple of helium balloons!
