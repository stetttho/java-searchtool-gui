 I noticed that someone else refered to this as a "Party Planner", and I think that's pretty accurate. It seems to be designed more for a woman who wants to throw theme parties that may end up with her in bed with her husband when the guests go home, (which isn't a bad thing). As far as actual seduction goes, though, it offers a little role-playing advice and costume and set design obviously geared toward people who haven't tried it before.  Personality types who are more comfortable following workbooks and craft kits than making up their own designs will find this useful. There are a lot of good suggestions for additional details (well... some of the suggestions in the "Kookie Baths" seemed to be leaning toward Asian stereotyping to me... dressing up is okay, but renaming your guests "Wong" and "Fong" is unnecessary in my opinion. But I digress...). Throwing a theme party following these guidelines is an excellent way to test role-playing on your husband without actually asking him "Hey, darling, can you dress up as a Roman Senator for me?". The cartoons give it a non-threatening format and there is nothing overtly embarassing in it. Most mothers of newlyweds can feel comfortable giving it as a first-anniversary gift, or buying it for themselves for a 25th anniversary gift. However, if you've already done some role-playing and are looking for ideas, it's unlikely you'll find any new revelations here.
