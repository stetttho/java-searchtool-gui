 I have my doubts about all of the songs actually being from the 50's, as the marketing leads you to believe. Some of them, like John & Jackie's "Little Girl", seem a little too raunchy and in too good condition to be that old. It is my favorite song, however; my husband and I laughed out loud when we heard it! Many of the songs have that great retro feel fans of "The Cramps" go for. The contrast between the jazz or rockabilly sound and the sex in the lyrics and titles makes for an interesting listen. It's more bawdy and faster than "Take it Off - Strip Tease Classics", and as far as home-stripping, would probably be better for someone who has a little experience. It would also be great fun to play at a Swing dance! I did have one problem. Tracks 3 and 4 were reversed on my CD. But I knew which one was the Peter Gunn Twist and it didn't really ruin my enjoyment of the album. All of the other songs appear to be in order. I'll be buying the others in the series.
