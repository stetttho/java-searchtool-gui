 If this had been marketed as a kind of amusing anthropological study rather than a manual of style, I would have rated it a five. As it is, it's a well-thought-out, well-organized study of the 30's to 50's Bombshell, and those who imitate them, but style manuals usually include more how-to. From the title and description I expected more things like how to do your hair like Rita or your makeup like Marilyn, or at least how to keep your seams straight. The author's observations are witty and fun to read, and you may be able to add or reconfirm some of the details if you're going for that look and attitude, but Bombshell How-To it is not.  Die-hard fans of old Hollywood Glamour movies or individual bombshells will be more entertained than I, but I'm more into the mysterious Femme-Fatale Vamp than the bubbly Bombshell to begin with, so I'm admittedly a little biased in that regard. (I loved the presentation and the writing, so would love to read "The Vamp Manual of Style" if they ever tried that subject!)
