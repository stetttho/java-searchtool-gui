 This book tells how to massage every part of the body. Scalp to toe. It's divided up by body section, so if you just want to do a back massage or a hand and foot massage, you can flip to that section and learn in a few minutes. There are beautiful pencil drawings of the inner workings of various parts of the body, where the most nerve endings are in the foot, which muscle is responsible for neck pain and some headaches (it's not in your neck), etc. He also talks about atmosphere and mood, which type of stroke is best used where, and what not to do during a massage (always important).  I work with my hands all day and my husband sits in an office chair. I find my hands feel LESS tired and stiff after I give him a back massage, and I usually lose track of time. What starts out as a quick 5 minutes lasts at least 20.  I became an expert at back massage after one reading. After my first try, my husband was so relaxed he was fast asleep before I got back from washing the oil off my hands. And he usually tosses and turns for at least an hour!
