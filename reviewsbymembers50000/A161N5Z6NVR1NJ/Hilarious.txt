 I started buying Mae West videos only recently. Even with my Gen-X, MTV attention span and no background score she has me glued to the TV and laughing out loud. It's worth it to buy this set, you won't be disappointed. To give a few examples, in I'm No Angel she visits a fortune-teller who tells her "I see a man in your life." Her immediate response is "What? Only one?" And it isn't just her smart mouth--later she rearranges pictures of the men in her life next to her animal figurines. The "Stag" is obviously the current favorite, and her boss is next to the skunk. When Cary Grant breaks off their engagement, she sues him for breach of contract, and the bold way she works the courtroom while representing herself could have been filmed yesterday. It seems even funnier because it's so out of place in my own misconception of "innocent" old movies.
