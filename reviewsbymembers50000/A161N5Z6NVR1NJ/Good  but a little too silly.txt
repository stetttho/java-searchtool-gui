 This is a great book to get if you're interested in kissing history, kissing games, recipes named for kisses and kissing trivia, but it is not, as the title suggests, a book devoted to kissing techniques. Don't get me wrong, there are quite a few different types of kissing techniques to try, but only a few stood out as interesting, appetizing and practical enough to add to my repertiore, (although they did get good reviews!) I get the feeling they were really reaching to make it to 500 kisses. One of them, for example, involved licking your partner's face clean. However, there isn't anything x-rated in it, so shy people may benefit from it without being embarassed, and a lot of them will surprise your partner and get them laughing, which is always good.
