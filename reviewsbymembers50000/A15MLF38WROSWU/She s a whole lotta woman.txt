 This is a cool movie to watch.  I'm a huge Pam Grier fan, and granted the movie is an old one, Foxy was B.A.D!!!  Girlfriend could handle her business.  Foxy is having to bail her brother Linc out of trouble, and she wants to avenge the death of her man.  She keeps telling Linc he needs to have some ambition.  She really loved her brother despite his behavior.  My favorite scene in the movie was when Linc said the following:  "I"m a Blackman, I don't know how to sing, I don't know how to dance, I don't know how to preach to no congregation.  I'm too small to be a football hero, and too ugly to be elected mayor.  When I see the homes they live in, and the cars they drive I get full of ambition".  I could not help but focus on what he said, because I know plenty of black men who still think that way now!!!  Foxy will not let anyone get in the way of her quest for revenge and anyone who does, they better watch out because they will be sorry.  Foxy goes undercover as a prostitute to find out the people responsible for the murders are the madam she is working for, her pretty boy, philandering, and racist boyfriend.  The number 2 in charge, and two sadistic, incompetent henchmen.  It was fun to see the funky outfits from back in the day, and this movie is full of action.
