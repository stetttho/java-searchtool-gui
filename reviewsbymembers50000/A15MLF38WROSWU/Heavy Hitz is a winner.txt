 This is a great album.  You can put this in your CD player and just let it play.  Heavy D was so smooth in his delivery.  He could flow on the hip hop love tracks like #2.  Don't yu know , and then party on jams like track 9.  You can't see what I can see.  Heavy talked about love when other hip hop artist were trying to be tough, or use the medium to make a political statement or raise social conscious (Public Enemy, KRS-One). Before folks get their undies in a bunch, I'm a huge fan of Public Enemy and KRS-One, but Heavy D. took Hip Hop to a different level with his hip hop love tracks.   Heavy D was one of the few hip hop artist to cross over into the pop charts.  Run DMC being the other.    Favorite Cuts: 3.  Don't you know 4.  We got our own thang - (great song for the IPOD to play at the gym) 5.  Sombebody for me 7.  Now that we found love 8.  Is it good to you 9.  You can't see what I can see - (great song for the IPOD to play at the gym) 11.  Nuttin but love 14.  On Point - (great song for the IPOD to play at the gym)  This is a great CD to have in your collection if you were a Heavy D fan like I am.  You get a nice mix of favorite songs on 1 CD.  The Overweight Lover's in da house!!!
