 I had to really struggle to finish this movie.  It was pretty dull.  This movie is about a ?dysfunctional family?.  Royal Tenenbaum is the father of genius children, that really do not like him.  He is a self centered, manipulating jerk.  He was an attorney until he got disbarred.  You have the children, very depressing Margot who is a playwright.  Richie is a tennis pro, and Chas who is a finance genius and father of two boys.  He is a widower and very, very protective of his sons.  They were raised by Etheline their mom.  Despite their success, they all wish they had that family dynamic that is missing in their lives.  When Royal gets kicked out of the hotel he was living in, he schemes his way back into his family?s life by claiming he is sick.  The family is living together in the house and still trying to maintain their own lives, while dad is attempting to make up for all his wrong doings.  Etheline is engaged to Henry Sherman and Royal is doing everything to prevent that marriage from happening.  Will the family ever come to terms with the problems in the family or will they remain at odds with each other?  Owen Wilson co-wrote and was Executive Producer of this film in addition to acting in the movie.    Though the movie had a wonderful cast, I felt the movie dragged on and I started to lose interest quick.  I was not drawn into any of the characters or their plot lines at all.  I did not feel sorry for anyone, and was at the point where I just wanted the movie to end.  Even when Chas had his crisis happen, he bounced back so quick you did not have time to even respond to what he did to himself.  The emotion displayed in the movie was so misplaced.  The film was just dull.  It?s categorized as a comedy, but I think it?s more of a dark comedy.  Do not expect to do much, if any laughing with this film.
