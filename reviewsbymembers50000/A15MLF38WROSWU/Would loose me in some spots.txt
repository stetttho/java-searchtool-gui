 I'm the type of person where in order for me to read a book, you have to keep me interested.  I read the book because I wanted to see how it would end, but I had to really struggle to complete the book.  I liked how the main character wanted to change her life for the better.  She fought to get to where she was, and would not let anyone take anything away from her.  I just did not like how the book would get interesting, then IMHO get dull.  The book was also predictable, I like to be kept guessing.  It was an okay read, but I'm glad I borrowed this book from the library.
