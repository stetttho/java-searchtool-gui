 You won't find ToTo here!!!!  Oz is a prison where men are supposed to be rehabilitated.  Instead the men are still committing crimes, being violated, fighting for their rights, their lives, and trying to maintain their sanity.  Season 1 you are introduced to Warden Glynn, trying to maintain order in the prison, and keep the funding.  McManus he runs the Oz section, but sometimes his best laid plans don't always work.  Augustus Hill is in a wheelchair, and he narrates the episodes.  Kareem Said is the Muslim leader.  I love this guys character, despite being in prison, he still tries to bring a sense of discipline, order, and he does not allow anyone to mess with him or his religion!!!  Do not try to cross this brother!!  He tries to help other black men follow the faith even if they end up on death row.  This man enters the prison, and you see people go nuts!!!  Some men like him and some can't stand him and want to see him dead.  Sister Peter tries to help the men with their drug problems.  Beecher is the man that does not belong, he is a former lawyer who is serving time for driving while impaired, and for killing a young girl.  He meets up with Schillinger and his life goes from bad to nightmare.  Shcillinger makes him wear make up, violates him, and every chance he gets abuse and use him until Beecher has had enough!!  Alvarez is not in prison for 5 minutes before he is stabbed.  This show will have you on waves of emotion.  You will be angry, you will be shocked, you will be surprised, you will be sad, you will cry, and in some cases you will find yourself laughing.  You feel for some of the prisoners, you will hate some of the prisoner, and you will like or dislike some of the workers.  This is a GREAT show, and I'm looking forward to seeing Season 2 of Oz.
