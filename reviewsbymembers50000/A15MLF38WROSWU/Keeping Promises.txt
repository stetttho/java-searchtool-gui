 I fell in love with Jordy, and parts of this book made me laugh and cry.  Book had some action and was filled with intrique that kept me interested.  I'm looking forward to a book Robin will write making Tangi the main character.  She needed further development.  Romare was hooked on Gillian at first site, and fighting his growing love was a complete waste of time.  Enjoyed this book a lot.
