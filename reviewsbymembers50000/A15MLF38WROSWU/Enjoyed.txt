 I enjoyed this a lot. I will admit his first live movie "you so crazy was funnier", but I laughed so much watching this. His take on the who Martin Luther King being peaceful made me think he had been in my head, but I don't want to give anything away for people who never saw it. You get to see Martin Lawrence as a man, not just an entertainer. Very enjoyable. Will watch again and add to my collection of DVD's of comedians for sure.
