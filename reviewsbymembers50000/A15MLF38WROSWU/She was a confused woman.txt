 This was an interesting documentary.  I was very curious about this woman, and honestly never heard of her.  Grace found what she did empowering, and a way to take away the negativity that comes with women being in the sex industry.   Her issue is when men have sex with multiple women, they are looked at as studs.  When a woman does it, she is looked at as loose.  She is tired of the double standard, and I honestly can't say I blame her.  Her goal was to have sex with 300 men, but she had to stop at 251.  Later someone did beat her record of 300.  What was disturbing was her answer regarding STD's, especially HIV.  Her answer was simply she would have no regrets and that she did an amazing thing.  But if what she was doing was so amazing why hides the fact she was a porn start from her mother?  She was a mixed up person, and sometimes seemed a little infantile to me.  If you are expecting to see a lot of sex while watching this, you will be disappointed.  You will have to be open minded to watch this DVD.  The documentary is done with interviews and outtakes, some which can be shocking IMHO.  The part where she was cutting herself was very disturbing.  It's really sad that some people feel they have to mutilate themselves in order to feel pain.    What was more disturbing is she puts her life at risk to do this, and was not paid her $10,000 fee and did not even fight for it.  If she was promised $10,000 she should have gotten her money!!!  What kind of stupidity is that?  She says that the United States is repressive, but she keeps what she does a secret.  So it would appear that Singapore is repressive as well, and the emotional outburst when she does reveal to her mother shows how much Grace/Annabel is confused.    When the documentary ended all I got out of this was this woman is confused and in a lot of turmoil.  I feel this documentary is interesting to rent, not purchase.
