 This movie was funny, but the first American Pie will always be the best one out of the three movies.  American Wedding should have been called "American Stiffler", seems like the focus was mostly on him with the bride and groom to be getting second and third billing.  It's a fun movie, and there are some parts you will laugh at more then other parts.  Good fun.
