 20 minutes of lost time causes Doyle Gibson to lose a custody battle with his exwife.  The lost time was caused by Banek cutting off Gibson on the FDR (I'm a former NY'er and I've had this happen to me!!!)  Doyle wants to do the right thing and exchange information, while Banek just wants to give him a blank check and be gone.  Banek is in such a rush he does not realize that he lost a file for the court case he is on his way to.  To get back at Banek Doyle holds the important file hostage!!!  This starts a series of events that just sets of a domino effect of I'm going to do you worse!!! Closing accounts, threatening phone calls, and possibly worse!! The movie is about morals, and doing the right thing.  The movie was not great, but it held my interest.
