 I thought this movie would be so terrible from the reviews I read. This movie (TO ME) was really, really good. The movie was suspenseful and thrilling. I even jumped during a few scenes!!! Halle Berry plays Miranda, a psychologist. One stormy night after a difficult session with Chole (Penelope Cruz), she makes her way home. As she is driving home, she has to take a detour. She crashes into a ditch when she thinks she has hit a girl standing in the rode. Miranda wakes up in the very institution she works at. She finds out that she is being charged with the murder of her husband (Dutton), but she can't remember what happens. Pete (Robert Downy Jr.) being Miranda's friend is trying to help her remember the nights events.     So now the question to be asked is why did she kill her husband? did she really kill her husband? Why are all these strange things happening to her? This movie will take you through and twists and turns that were unexpected. The movie because of the darkness in the sanitarium had a gloom and doom kind of effect.     I've read complaints about the blinking lights. The blinking lights did not bother me at all. I don't want to give anything away, but the lights had to do with a certain "ghost spirit" being in the area I wonder why other people did not catch that? I thought Halle did a wonderful job in this film. She screamed a lot, and ran. That was the point in this suspense thriller. I had some aspects of the movie figured out, but there was one thing I missed, and not until the clue was pretty much "in my face" did I truly realize what was going on.     This movie had me on the edge of my seat!!!
