 I just so happen to pick this up and I was not disappointed.  She has a nice singing voice and her album would have done better if they had chosen a different song to follow up Hit'Em Up Style.  Till I'm Gone, U Must be Crazy, The One, I'll Find a way, 10,000 times, When I need you, and So Blu are great songs. Good album to have in the collection.
