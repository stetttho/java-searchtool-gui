 I happen to love Duane Martin, and when I saw the preview of this movie I had to see it. It was not great, but I liked it enough I would actually watch it again. Some of the lines were kind of corny, but I liked the action in the film. If you like Rush Hour, Bad Boys, and Beverly Hills Cops (1 and 2), then you might enjoy this movie. I plan to rent this one again in the future.
