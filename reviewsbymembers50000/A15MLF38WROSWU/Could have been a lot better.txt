 I will say the ending of this movie totally caught me off guard, but aside of that, I did not really like this movie liked I hoped I would.  I'm usually a major fan of thrillers.  I think the main problem I had with the movie is the suspense never had a chance to build.  Just when things would get interesting, the climax for the scene would happen, and it was over too quick.    10 strangers find themselves stuck together on a rainy night in a motel after the storm washes out the road.  One by one the strangers are being murdered, and the strangers are trying to figure out what is going on, and who is responsible.  There are a lot of twists and turns in the film.  What I did like about the DVD is it contained three versions of the movie you could choose from.  You could select Full screen, wide screen (my favorite to watch) or the extended wide screen version.  You also get some deleted scenes, but they would not have added anything to the movie except to make the movie a few minuets longer.  The acting in this film is good, and this film has an excellent cast.  John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Rebecca DeMornay and Jake Busey.  My reason for giving this film a 2 score is the movie was not as thrilling as I had hoped it would be.  This is the type of movie you will watch once.  It's not the type of movie you will find yourself watching over and over again.
