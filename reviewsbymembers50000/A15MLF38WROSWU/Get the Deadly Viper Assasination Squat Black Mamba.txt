 Bill it's your baby!!!?  What a start to a movie that is just awesome!!!! Uma is The Bride/Black Mamba.  A pregnant bride who wanted out of the life as a killer, but Bill has other ideas, and sends the hit squad to finish her off.  Well so they thought.  Black Mamba is alive after being in a coma, she realizes her baby is gone, and she is out to get everyone who tried to kill her.  The fighting is gorey, bloody, and just action packed.  How ironic that copperhead (Viveca) has a weapon in a box of Kaboom cereal.  Uma does some serious mind over matter exercises to get her lower extremities to work so she can walk and drive!!!   One of my favorite scenes is the animation scene showing Oren Ishii?s life.  The crazy 88's scene is my absolute favorite scene in the movie that I watch over and over on my DVD.  I can never get tired of that scene.  I loved how you heard that music when Black mamba spotted a revenge victim.  You knew the fighting was about to start.  GoGo was intense with her metal ball weapon.  Despite the crazy 88's Black Mama did not let anything get in way of getting to Oren Ishii her main target.  This movie is phenomenal and I'm amazed some people did not enjoy this movie.  When you see Kill Bill Volume two, you get some closure.
