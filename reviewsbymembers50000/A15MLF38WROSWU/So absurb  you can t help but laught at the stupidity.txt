 The model look, the pouting of the lips, the gasoline fight, the blank stares, the absurdity, you can't help but laugh!!!  Stiller and Owen play models who hate each other and try to outdo one another.  A freak accident, no, a stupid accident leave three of Stiller's model friends dead, and he realizes there is more in life then being "really, really good looking" and decides he wants to retire from modeling. Will Farell play a fashion designer, who wants to kill someone and he gets Stiller to do it by hypnotism.  Stiller eventually notices a trend where male models are not living beyond the age of 30, and realizes he could be next in line to not make 30 if he does what he is supposed to do.   The line that still gets me "I'm bulimic"....."You can read minds?"  Oh that is a riot!!!  The movies picks fun at modeling, being a celebrity, and the movie has some wonderful cameos.  This movie is simply hilarious!!!
