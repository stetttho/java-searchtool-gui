 This film was DEEP.  I have not seen it in a while, but plan to see it again.  This movie is when I realized LL Cool J would not be a rapper turned actor that would end up in actors oblivion.  This man had me HATING him, and I love me some Cool J.  Omar Epps plays a cop who goes undercover, and has to gain the trust of a big drug lord (LL Cool J).  The movie kind of reminded me of Deep Cover a little.  It had that element of is he still a cop or is he a thug now element.  The film is not great, but good enough to keep you interested.
