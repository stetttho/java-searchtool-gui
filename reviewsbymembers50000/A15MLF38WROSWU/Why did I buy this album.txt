 Because someone was selling it on Amazon.com for $2.00, and I really wanted the Rock the party song for my cardio treadmill routine.  So I listen to the album and actually found 5 other songs that I like, and 3 other songs to add to my workout songs collection.   Benzino is kind of monotone, but so are some other hip hop artist.   Songs I will be getting my run on with: 3.  Rock the Party 9.  X-Tra Hot 11.  Get it on 13.  Hoola Hoop 16.  Rock the Party remix Out of 16 songs I like 7.  Considering I only paid $2.00 for this CD I won't complain too much.  He tried to go Hip Hop Lover a couple of times, but LL Cool J has that on lock.  No one can do it like LL.  Benzino's album is okay.
