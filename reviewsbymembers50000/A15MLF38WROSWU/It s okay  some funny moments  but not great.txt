 I've become a Ben Stiller fan after seeing him in There's Something about Mary.  He is funny, and I like Drew Berrymore.  I thought this movie would be a lot funnier.  The movie is about a husband and wife looking for their home and inheriting a neighbor that is a pain!!!  She is an elderly lady who has to count everything, and has a little mean streak.  The couple try to devise ways of getting her to move out and all their plans backfire.  I'm not one for movie extras so I could really care less about that, but the movie was okay.
