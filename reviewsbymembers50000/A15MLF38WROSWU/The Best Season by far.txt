 Sex and the City Season 6 starts off great!!!  You will find yourself laughing, crying, then laughing some more.  If you are a fan of the show, then you see how the characters have grown in the 6 years the show has been on.  Charlotte finally coming to terms with life not always being perfect, but that does not prevent her from trying to make it so.  You also see her willing to convert to Judaism to marry Harry.  A man you don't expect her to be with, but she let personality overshadow looks.  Charlotte is determined to have a child and you are with her while she is dealing with that.  That scene is the most heart wrenching.  You see Miranda struggle with dating, her career and motherhood.  Miranda also has a love affair with TIVO, and you wonder can she finally say I Love you?  Samantha is still Samantha, but now she is dealing with a much younger man, and grey hairs in odd places.  Carrie is dealing with dating, new boyfriends, ex-boyfriends, and boyfriends with thick accents.  When a pair of Carries shoes are taken while she attends a baby shower, her throwing a shower for herself and registering her shoes, was just BRILLIANT!!!  I mean why should Carrie be made to feel bad about how much she  spends on shoes?  If she wants to spend over $400 for shoes, let her spend that much for shoes!!!  She has no children, and I felt that woman was responsible for the shoes, or tried harder to find out who stole Carries Milano shoes!!! I mean what kind of person steals someone's shoes?   Blair Underwood, all I can say is that man is so handsome and I was riveted to the screen every time he made his appearance as Dr. Leeds.  Oh my!!!!   My only complaint is season 6 is a 20 episode season, and for some reason, only 12 episodes have been released.  Why tease us like that?   Season 6 is by far the best season of Sex and the City.  I'm looking forward to seeing the 8 episodes when they are released.
