 This is my favorite release from Beenie since his The Doctor release. This is the kind of CD you can put in your player and just let it play and play.  After buying my copy, I had it playing in my CD player for a straight week.  The beats on this album are awesome.  The lyrics make you want to sing right along or just get up and dance.  Dude is one of my favorite cuts on the album, but I actually like the remix version that I have as a single with Shawna and Ms. Thing.  Her verse adds a little something to the cut and it's a shame it was not included on the album.  I'm a huge dancehall fan, and Beenie has enough dancehall cuts on the album to keep you satisfied.  This is  a must have album to have in your collection.   I will admit there are times I don't totally understand what Beenie is saying, but I'm so caught up in the rhythm I really don't care.  I enjoy some of the songs to dance and work out to.  Beenie seems to always have one song praising God on his albums, and this album is no different.  "If A never God", is a nice song.  It has a nice beat to get your praise on with.    Cuts I enjoyed the most: 1.  Dude 2.  King of Dancehall 3.  Love all Girls 5.  Grindacologist  6.  Get On Bad 7.  Good Woe 8.  Doctor Mi Rate Yu 9.  Set Away 10.  Eloh 11.  All Grind Party 12.  P***y Language  This album is worth having in your CD collection for sure.
