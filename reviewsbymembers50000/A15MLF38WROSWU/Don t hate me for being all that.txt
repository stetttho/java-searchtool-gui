 My curiosity got the better of me, and I purchased this DVD.  I'm so happy I did!!!  This DVD is great.  This is a colorized, flavorized, and animated version of another show I'm sure I don't have to name.  The 4 Sista's are Tamika, Mercedes, Jordan and Athena.  These ladies are doing their thing Chicago.  Even though the segments are short, they pack punch, and you can relate.  Tamika is the career driven sista dating a mamas boy.  Mercedes feels the only thing a black man can do for her is show her where the white man are.  Law Clerk Jordan feels men are from mars and women are stuck on earth. Athena is going to do what it takes to get her music career off the ground.  Even if it means she does not recognize herself in the mirror.    The various topics range from; mammas boy, man issues, career issues, hair issues, family drama, and friendship.  I had so much fun watching this DVD, I laughed during each episode.  Despite all the problems these ladies go through, they are there for each other through the thick and thin.    DVD extras you will get a roundtable discussion with the creator Tina Andrews, and three of her friends.  You get an interview with Tina Andrews, and another one with musician, and the voice behind Athena Medusa.   Actress Dawnn Lewis is the voice behind Tamika.    You will find yourself humming Medusa's song long after you watch the DVD.  "Don't hate me for being all that, Don't be mad because I'm running this.  I'm one bad Sista."  I have to echo the sentiments of the previous reviewers.  The segments are too short.  You get barely 5 min for each episode.  The short segments are the only reason I'm not giving this DVD a 5 rating.  Even though this is animated, this DVD is NOT FOR CHILDREN.  I hope they consider bringing out another DVD, I would most definitely purchase it.  This is a DVD you should consider buying for yourself, and some for your sister friends and female members of your family.  You won't be disappointed.
