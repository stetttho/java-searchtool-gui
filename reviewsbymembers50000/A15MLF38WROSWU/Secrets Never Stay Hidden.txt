This book was slow, slow, slow.  Chapter 55-56 were the most exciting parts of the book.  I was about to put it down when I got to that point.  I really felt the story did not need to be dragged out so much.  I just did not like this book by the time I finished it.  Glad I borrowed this from the library.
