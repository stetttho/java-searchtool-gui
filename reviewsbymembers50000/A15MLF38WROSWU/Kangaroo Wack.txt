 I happen to find a copy of this DVD in the library, and I'm so happy I was able to borrow this for FREE, because I would have been too angry if I had spent my hard earned money renting this garbage.  Can a movie be any worse?  Bruckheimer needs to stick with action movies and not attempt another Family type movie.    The problem I had with this movie is too much going on and the ingredients did not mix well.  Kangaroo Jack was trying to be an action movie, a comedy, a cute animal movie and a family movie.  It did not work!!!  This movie is in no way a family type movie with all the sexual innuendo thrown around.  I actually like Jerry O'Connell (Scream 2, Crossing Jordan), and Anthony Anderson (Barbershop, Romeo Must Die, Cradle to the Grave), but I did not enjoy them in this film.   Jerry O'Connell plays Charlie, and he pretty much owes his life to his friend Louis (Anthony Anderson) for saving his life at the age of 8.  Problem is Charlie did not realize he would always have to keep Louis out of trouble.  Charlie is a hairstylist and when Louis's latest scheme gets them into trouble, they are sent to Australia to deliver fifty thousand dollars to some business man that is an associate of Charlies step dad played by Christopher Walken.  While driving, they hit a kangaroo and think they killed it.  For some stupid reason, Louis puts his jacket (with the money still inside) on the kangaroo and start taking pictures.  The kangaroo was not killed, and wakes up and takes off with the money.  The movie is spent trying to locate the kangaroo, and get the money back.    If you want to watch good family animal movies then do yourself a favor and rent the following titles: 1. Dr. Doolittle  2. Stuart Little 3. Stuart Little 2 4. Snow Dogs.    Leave Kangaroo Wack, ummmm I mean Jack on the shelves.
