 I've already written my review, but had to post another comment.  I'm seeing where people are saying he is biting off of Justin Timberlake.  If anything Justin has bitten off of Usher!!!!  Usher has been in the business longer, so please do not get it twisted!!!  This is a good album and it's Usher's style!!!
