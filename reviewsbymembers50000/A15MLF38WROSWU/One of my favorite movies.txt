 I just love this movie.  I don't buy DVD's for the extras. I was so happy I could get this movie on DVD. The movie is about three men who are friends.  One is getting married, and he is having second thoughts.  The movie takes you through a series of flash backs.  I spend time laughing at how folks dressed and wore their hair.  It makes you remember when you were in junior and high school.  The movie is fun.  It's a movie about choices, growing up, friendship and most of all love.  Loving your family, friends and the one you want to spend the rest of yoru life with.  It's a fun movie to watch.
