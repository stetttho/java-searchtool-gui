 This is the first book I've read by Omar Tyree, and after reading this not too sure if I will be reading others.  The book showed a deep friendship of two African American males from North Carolina.  John "Loverboy" Williams is a young man with a gift, he can sing, and write the best of songs.  He wanted to please his public, and would go to great lengths to do so.  Darin Harmon had dreams of becoming a football player, but John really wants him by his side as his music career takes off as his manager.  John trust Darin and knows Darin will look out for his best interest and not rip him off.   John's music career really takes off, and when Darin injures himself while playing football, he changes his mind and decides to help John with his career.  John starts changing, and not for the best.  Darin decides not to manage him anymore John's life starts to fall apart.  John (like many who are in the music industry) fall into a life of drugs, and dealing with the wrong people.  The book does show how hard life can be for celebrities despite all the glamour, and the money.  You get to read how the music industry really works.  Omar gave us a peek at dealing with tours, and promotion for an artist.  The song lyrics in the book were disruptive during reading.  I did like the spiritual references made in the book.  It showed how important it is to keep your faith.  I must also mention that Loverboy had a tumultuous relationship with his mom.  Mom is very religious and wanted her son to finish college and not go into the music business.  The book is too slow paced.  I normally finish a book in about two or three days, but it took me almost three weeks to get through this book, and I had to struggle to read it.   I say Just say NO to reading this book.  I'm glad I borrowed this one from the library!!!!
