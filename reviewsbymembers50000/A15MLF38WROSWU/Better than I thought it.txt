 This movie is not science fiction the way I thought of science fiction.  The movie is very suspenseful, and it's action packed.  This movie is about a cop who is dealing with the loss of his son, but trying to be on top of his game in his field.  He is a cop, who can pick out the clues of a crime BEFORE it happens, and stop that crime.  That in itself is an interesting concept.  When Anderton, becomes one of the criminals he is in the fight of his life!!!  Watching this movie you are led to believe one person has framed Anderton, but then you will find out you are wrong.  I was really into this movie, and if you don't have super high expectations, you will find this movie to be a really good one.  I was very impressed.  The precogs were a nice twist in the film.  The other aspect of the movie that grabbed me was "choice".  There is a certain part of the film where choice plays a huge part in the film.  You can make the right choice, or you will make the wrong choice.  How will that choice truly affect your life?  I really liked that philosophical aspect of the film.
