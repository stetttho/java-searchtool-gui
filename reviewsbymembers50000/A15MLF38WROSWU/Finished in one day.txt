 I could not put this book down for anything.  I loved this book, and Kayla Perrin is one of my favorite authors.  This book had mystery, intrique and passion.  I enjoyed this book mainly because it grabs you from the first page and won't let go.  You feel Moniques pain, but you want her so much to find out the answers.  Throughout the book you are made to believe one person "done" it, but then you eventually put the pieces of the puzzle together.  Khamil sounds oh so dreamy!!!  Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!!!
