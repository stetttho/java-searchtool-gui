 It's the 1920's and finding work is hard, but if you are a black man it's even worse.  So if you happen to have a job as a Pullman on the trains, you work that job with pride, you don't complain, and you keep your mouth shut.  It does not matter that you have your own name, it does not matter that you are seen as less then a man, it does not matter you have dirty shoes thrown at you to shine, you smile and you take it.  But what happens when you finally realize enough is enough?  What can you do, who do you turn to, how much are you willing to sacrifice to get what you truly deserve?  Will you continue to stand for what you believe in, no matter how much others will dissuade you, or beat you down?  Those are the questions that will be asked while watching this film.  I found this to be a poignant film.  I don't have Showtime, and I had never heard of this film, and found a copy in the library.  I enjoyed this film so much I plan to add this to my collection.  The historical content alone is what kept me riveted to the screen, and you feel the pain of the men in this film.  I mean to have your own name, but to be called "George" every day, and working for a meager $60 a month?  The acting in this film is stellar. The only reason I'm not giving this film a 5 is because I felt it could have been a little longer.  Andre Braugher is a great actor, and one who should receive more accolades.  Mario Van Peebles does his best performance in this film especially.  Mario is an excellent actor who needs to make better film choices.  I have yet to see Charles Dutton in a bad film role.  This is a movie you must see!!!
