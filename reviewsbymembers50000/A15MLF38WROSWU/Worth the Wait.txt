 This book grabbed my attention from the first page and I could not put it down until I finished it.  Matthew knew his beloved Kaitlin did not die in a plane crash and he would not rest until he found her.  When he resigned to the fact that Kaitlin was gone and move on with his life, he finds out Kaitlin has been in Mexico and sets out to save her.  Reunited they must get over past secrets that could tear them apart.  This book is exciting, mysterious and well written.  I need to dig through my boxes and find the other book and read it again.
