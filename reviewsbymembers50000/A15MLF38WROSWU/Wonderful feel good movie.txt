 I love this movie!!!  It shows the dog eat dog world of business.  Melanie Griffith plays a secretary who wants a better position.  She gets a new job with a female boss (Sigourney Weaver) and finally thinks things are looking up.  Until she realizes her boss stole an idea of hers and is taking the credit.  She ends up doing everything possible to secure a big deal and falls in love with Harrison Ford's character.  This is such a touching movie.  The girl gets the guy, and she gets the great job opportunity she really wants.  The ending is what I like the most.  When she tells her new secretary, don't get me coffee unless you get some for yourself too.
