 I enjoyed this romance book.  It was sweet story.  Niki Hamilton is a doctor fighting the HMO system and it leaves her burned out.  She takes a vaction to help her good friend run her Dating service and meets the man who steals her heart.  In the story King-Gamble weaves in a story where Niki Hamilton finds out who is trying to ruin her career.  I found this to be excellent.
