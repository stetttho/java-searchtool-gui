 This artist does not get the radio play she should  I have been playing this CD like crazy.  I'm a music fan who gets upset when TRUE artist are not given some serious air play.  Syleena Johnson makes Ashanti sound like Minnie Mouse... This is a phenomenal album.  When she sings, you really feel like she wrote a song just with you in mind.  Like she peeked in your journal.  I juse the remix to Tonight I'm gonna let go while at the gym on the treadmill.  One of my other favorite songs is Number 7 Is that You!!!  AWESOME!!!  If you are trying to figure out if you want to purchase this album, don't hesitiate, BUY IT!!!  You won't be sorry.
