 Loud is right, loud with the cussing!!!  I had been wanting to see this DVD for a while.  I really enjoy Sommore and Mo'Nique, but this DVD was a let down.  These ladies have no problems discussing just about any topic from spending 5 days in jail, sex, black men, sex, children, sex, marriage, and sex.  You also got some behind the scenes footage, which to me was really not necessary.  I knew better then to compare this to the Kings of Comedy.  I mean why even bother? I knew it would be different, but the titles were similar so I guess that's why people made the comparison.  I have no problem with cussing.  It just seemed extremely excessive, and it was not funny.  That's part of the problem I have with some comics, the use of cussing as a filler to help expand their act.  You don't have to cuss to be funny.  When I could laugh, I enjoyed some of the jokes, but aside of that, it's not gut busting funny.  It's not hysterical.  This was a major, major let down. You do not need to use excessive foul language to be funny!!!
