 Nathan Ward is left at the alter and decides it's a perfect time to try and get his old girlfriend back, after letting 15 years pass.  I will admit the book lost me, and I almost did not finish it.  Then it picked up and I read the book until the very end.  It turns out to be a sweet story that tugs at your heart.
