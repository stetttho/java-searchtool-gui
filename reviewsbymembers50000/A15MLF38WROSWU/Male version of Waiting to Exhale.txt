 Okay the movie is not fantastic, but I liked it anyway. 4 men in different stages of their relationships. I pretty much thought of the movie as a Male version of Waiting to Exhale.    Jackson (Morris Chestnut) has major commitment problems.  Brian (Bill Bellamy) you will eventually figure out his relationship woes are due to the relationship he had with his mom giving him his jaded views on love. Terry (Shemar Moore) finally decides to settle down, and right before the big day, he let's his commitment phobia shine through.  Derrick (D.L. Hughley), is married and devoted to his family.  His problem?  His wife refuses to have oral sex with him, and it's causing serious isses with their relationship.  The movie has some funny moment and the acting though not academy award winning was decent.  I happen to love the movie and I've watched my copy a few times.
