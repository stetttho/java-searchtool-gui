 Interesting book about the lives of hotel consultants.  Austin Hughes is happily single, but he needs to be married to travel on business to West Africa.  Desiree Mack happily accepts being that she loves her job and this gives her a chance to show the big boss what she is made of.  She does everything to resist, but finds herself drawn to him and does not want to put her career in jeapordy by crossing the line.   I feel the book could have gone a little deeper about the sabatoge of his busines.  All in all this books is a good read.
