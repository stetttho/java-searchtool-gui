 I kept hearing people talk about Daves show, so I finally decided to rent the DVD.  Okay his show is good, and he is funny.  No holds barred funny.  He picks on everything, and anyone.  What I enjoyed the most about the show was being to hear everything unedited.  Which is why I did not watch the show while it was on Comedy Central, hearing the show being edited takes away from the enjoyment of the show.  I spent so much time laughing there were times I had to rewind the DVD to catch things I missed.  I found some skits funnier then others, and some were just shocking.  I did not find any of the subject matter to be offensive, but if you are easily offended, then you should not even bother viewing this, because I'm sure Dave upset plenty of folks!!!   My one complaint is the fact they would keep the "we will be back after this commercial break", and then the show would be over.  I thought that should have been left out completely.   Some of my favorite skits: Life Like a Video Game Player Haters Ball Blackzilla  Tyrone Biggums Racist Animals What man want (spoof on the movie What Women want) Wu Tang Financial Ask a Black Dude Star Wars Scandal The Mad Real World Ask a Gay Dude Redman Potty Fresh Redman Toilet Freshener - I will get the brown out!!! Wrap it up Box Blind Black White Supremist This is a fun show to watch.
