 One of my favorite albums by R.  This is when we had to realize, "this brother is talented!!!!"  This album was good because he had some of his love songs on it, then the songs to make you groove, and threw in some spirtual songs to round it off.  There is something for everyone on this CD.  My favorite cuts on this CD: 2. Hump Bounce - nice litte groove 6. Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby 7. You to be Happy 8. Down Low - the relationship between he and Isley was born 9. I can't sleep baby 14.Temp Slow 16. Trade in My life - he was testifying on this song!!! The whole album is good, but the songs I listed are the songs I play the most.
