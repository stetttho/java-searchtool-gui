 We meet up with Annette Good five years later.  The sequel is about reunions, forgiveness and facing the past, and looking ahead to the future.  Facing the past means having to own up to past transgressions and accepting responsibility for your actions.    What I enjoyed about this book was if you did not read the first book, you were able to thoroughly enjoy this book because Monroe was really good about rehashing parts of "God Don't like Ugly".
