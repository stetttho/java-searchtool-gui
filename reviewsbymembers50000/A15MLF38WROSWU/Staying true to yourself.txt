 I really enjoyed this movie. It shows what can happen when you are behind the scenes of show business. How a person can get caught up, and how much it can change your life, and not always for the better. A really good movie to watch, with some good acting. People will want to compare this movie to Bamboolzed, but they are very different. I saw this when it first came on HBO a few years ago.  Tommy Crawford (Nicole Ari Parker of TV's "Soul Food"), is a staff writer on a television sitcom. When she speaks out about the show she is writing on she gets fired.   She pitches her own television series to a start-up television network.  George Washington (Isaiah Washington), an ambitious executive at the network, sees Tommy's show as a way up the corporate ladder and champions the project. Tommy's (called "Just Us") is on the network's fall line-up after some "creative tweaking." Another reason to check out this movie is for Vicellous Reon Shannon's performance as James or "Semaj." His character is going through some emotional changes, and he is trying to make good with the mother of his child played by Melinda Williams (Soul Food Series).  This movie is really excellent, and it's one you really should see.  It's powerful without beating you on the head.  You will get the message easily.
