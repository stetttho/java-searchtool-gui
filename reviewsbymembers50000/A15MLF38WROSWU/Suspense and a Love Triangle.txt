 Emery (played by Shemar Moore) has it all.  Money, a great career, and a beautiful wife named Constance (Viveca Fox).  He could lose it all by having an affair with a beautiful temptress named Allanah (Goldyn Brooks).  The movie is a suspense thriller. The movie is about Love, Betrayal, and making decisions that you will later regret.  The movie has you wondering who is trying to play who, the person that you think is doing the playing ends up getting played.  I enjoyed the movie. It's a decent movie.  One I will watch again.
