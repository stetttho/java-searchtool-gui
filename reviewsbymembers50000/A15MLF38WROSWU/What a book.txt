 From the first page until the last page I was ADDICTED!!!  Friends and a close cousin of mine told me about this book.  I'm glad I read it and will be discussing this book at an upcoming book club meeting.  When Zoe started her spiral into cheating, all I wanted to do was go through the book and slap her!!  Slap her for being so stupid and obsessed with sex she was willing to lose everything.  Then you could not help but feel sorry for her a little.  Then I could not understand why Jason was the way he was regarding sex with his wife.  When all the answers came out, everything made sense. I also wanted to grab Briana and shake some sense into her.  Zane touched on a sesitive topic that many women do not want to face.  Loving yourself enough that you would let no man abuse you.  This book was not only [wonderful], but full of mystery.  I'm looking forward toreading more of Zane's work.  A great read!!!
