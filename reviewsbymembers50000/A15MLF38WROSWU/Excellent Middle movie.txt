 This is the second installment of the LOTR trilogy.  Even though this was a good film, I found it to be a little slow moving in some parts, but by the end your interest will be peaked and the ending will leave you salivating for the third installment.  This movie does a great job of tying up some lose ends from the first installment and leaving you wanting more by waiting for the third installment to come out.  I did not see any of the movies in theaters.  So the one advantage I had was seeing two and being able to pop the third movie (LOTR: The Return of the King) into my DVD player right away, versus having to wait for the third installment to come out in the theaters.    The visuals for this movie are so amazing, and I really liked those trees.  Walking and talking trees simply awesome.  You see a lot more of Gollum in this installment and he is obsessed with "my precious" as he liked to call the ring.  He hungered for the power and his split personality will leave you confused but intrigued.  Gollum reminded me of a drug addict who had to have his next fix.  You could see the hunger in his eyes, the wanting of that ring, and you knew he would do just about anything to get it.  While the first installment focused on Frodo and his friends.  This movies focal point is on Aragorn, the exiled king.  Watching the battles was so incredible.  I knew they would be even more awesome in the third installment.  This is a perfect middle movie which will lead to a climatic third installment.
