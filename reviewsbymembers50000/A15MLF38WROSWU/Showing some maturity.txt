 Usher is all grwon up and I'm loving it!!!!  If I would have gone by some of the reviews written I would have passed on a good album.  Usher really went into his soul for some of the lyrics for this album, and you can feel what he has gone through.  The tracks I like on this album are the following: 2.  Yeah - my workout jam of course 3.  Throwback 6.  Burn 7.  Caught Up 10. Truth Hurts 11. Simple Things 12. Bad Girl 13. That's what it's made for 14. Can you handle it 16. Take your Hand He is as far as I'm concerned the King of R&B.  So Bobby Brown, hand over your crown and give it to the true King!!!!!!
