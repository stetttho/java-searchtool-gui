 I thought this was a really good book with the exception of some editing errors.  The book is about independant Leslie who is in school, and eager to get her career off the ground.  She falls for a much older man with some major baggage is trying to figure out what she should do. Her "cuz" Rachelle is a single mother of three trying to juggle two men, and her life.  The book is an easy read, and will hold your interest.  Again my only complaint is the editing.  In one chapter Rachelle is driving a white toyota, then in another chapter it's a blue Toyota.  Then she is driving a blue Plymouth, that turns into a blue Mazda.  I hope Hunter Hayes got a much better editor with the next book.
