 I was in the library with my niece and she grabbed this DVD.  How can you say no to someone with the most adorable eyes.  So I checked out the DVD, we went home and had a wonderful, wonderful time.  This is the kind of movie you can appreciate no matter how young or old you are.  James P Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman), and Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal) are monsters who work for Monsters Inc.  Sulley is the best at getting his fair share of scares, but he has some competition in Randall who wants to be the top scare monster.  The more screams collected, the more energy for Montropolis.  The monsters are led to believe that if a child enters their "world" they will be contaminated and everything could be destroyed.  The real fun part starts when this adorable human child named Marry (Boo buy Sulley) sneaks into Montropolis by accident.  The kids are scared of the monsters, and the monsters are terrifiedof the kids.  Sully and Mike try to get Boo back to her world, but she won't leave.  Turns out Randall is her scary monster.  Also turns out that Randal has a plan up his sleeve to extract screams that could put the other monsters out of work.  It's up to Sully and Mike to save Montroplis and Monsters Inc.  This is a fun, entertaining film that will leave with a happy, happy feeling when it's all over.  Steve Bucemis I the voice for Randal Boggs, and other notable actors are James Coburn, and Jennifer Tilly (who has the perfect voice for animation, she should do more of it!!!) and Bonnie Hunt.  This is an adorable movie.  One I will watch again, with or without my niece.
