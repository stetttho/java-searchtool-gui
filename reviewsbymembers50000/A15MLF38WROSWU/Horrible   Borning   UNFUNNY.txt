 I borrowed this movie from my local library.  This has to be the most unfunny movie I've ever seen.  This movie was BORING, BORING, BORING, AND MORE BORING!!!  Since when did watching a bunch of movies make a person eligible to make movies?  During the featurette, when one of the guys was asked what makes him qualified to make movies, he commented "I've watched over 1,000 movies."  That right there should have been my clue to take the DVD out of my machine and save myself the agony of watching this horrible feature film.  There is one character who is blind, in the mob and thinks he is Italian, but he is black.  Clyde is a former numbers runner trying to help his stupid cousin pay back the mob.  Mo Fo is a thug who keeps getting mistaken for Roscoe and getting his butt whupped, and there is Pam who is the "nut crusher".  Even the potty humor in the movie was not funny.  This movie has terrible editing, terrible acting, this movie is simply TERRIBLE.  Do yourself a favor and DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.
