 Thrill seeking archaeologist and explorer journeys to an underwater temple that leads to a sphere containing Pandora's box.  Someone wants to use the box for evil, and Laura has to try to stop him!!!  I felt like I was watching a female version of Indiana Jones.  The one scene I really enjoyed were those monsters coming out of the trees, but even that reminded me of a scene from Mortal Combat.  The movie was too recycled and had no originality.
