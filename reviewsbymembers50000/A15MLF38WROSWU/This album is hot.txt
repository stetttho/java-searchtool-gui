 I happen to find this album in a store for $8.99, and I knew I loved the song Bananza so I decided to pick up the CD.  I knew I could not beat the price.  Well this album actually surprised me, and it's really, really good.  Unlike some of the other reviewers I never heard the song Locked up until I listened to the CD.  I don't listen to the radio because I'm sick of hearing the same songs, over, and over, and over again.    Akon has a nice melodious voice.  You hear his voice, and you instantly think Caribbean, but he is singing some really meaningful R&B songs.  He also produced all the songs on his debut CD.  He does not sound like anyone else out there, which makes me appreciate his material that much more. The songs he sings are about different phases in his life. He has lived a tough life. So he gives you a peek into his life through his songs.  This album makes you sit up and take notice when you listen to the words.  It's very refreshing to hear an album that is not laced with lyrics full of sexual innuendo, and the materialistic life.  This brother is singing about being in jail, and life after.  The song I love the most is Bananza.  I remember hearing that song in 2003, and it took me about a two weeks to finally find out who this brother was.  He was getting radio play, but I could never catch the name if the Artist.  That's my favorite song to workout too when I'm jogging along the trail I jog on.    My favorite songs are:  3.  Bananza 4.  Gangta 5.  Ghetto 7.  Show Out 9.  When the Time is right 10.  Journey 12.  Easy road  This album is a good first effort, and if you pick it up you won't be disappointed.
