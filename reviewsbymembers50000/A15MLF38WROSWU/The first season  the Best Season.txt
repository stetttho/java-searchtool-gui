 I did not start watching Buffy until Season 3.  I tried to catch what I could on syndication, but there is an advantage to owning shows on DVD.  1. You don't have to deal with commercials.   2. You get to see episodes that always don't come on in syndication. 3. You get to watch the episodes you want, when you want.   Buffy and her mom move to Sunnydale for a new start. Buffy hopes to leave behind her past, and be a regular teenager.  First episode Buffy starts the first day of school she meets Xander the sweet dorky guy, Willow the super smart girl who really likes Xander, Cordelia the popular girl who swears the world revolves around her, Giles the Librarian and her new Watcher, and Angel the mystery man that she will eventually fall for.  This show has comedy, horror, and drama.  In addition to fighting vampires Buffy has to fight a She-Mantis, a robot, witches, evil puppets, and even an invisible girl!!  Seeing "Never Kill a Boy on the First Date"  I finally understood where the little boy came from and his connection to the vampires.  I never saw "the Pack" but after seeing it I finally understood what happened to principal Flutey.   My favorite episodes: 1.	The Witch  2.	Teacher's Pet 3.	The Puppet Show 4.	Welcome to the Hellmouth 5.	The Harvest 6.	The Pack 7.	I Robot....You Jane 8.	Out of mind out of sight I enjoy all of season 1, but really enjoy the above mentioned episodes the most.  I look forward to adding to my Buffy collection with Seasons 2-5.
