 I took a chance and bought this album.  I'm glad I did.  She is raw!!!  I'm trying to figure out why she did not get more radio play!!!  What is up with radio these days.  You can tell she poured her heart out in some of those lyrics.  Ching Ching Part II will have you dancing and hitting the repeat button!!!  Good album.
