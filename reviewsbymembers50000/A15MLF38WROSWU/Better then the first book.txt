 If you are looking for romance, then you don't need to read this book. If you are kind of prudish, then you don't need to read this book.  If you can't handle a book with some serious sexual content, you don't need to read this book. If you are looking for some good erotic then this is the book for you. If yuo are uninhibited, then this book is for you.  If you are comfortable in your own skin and sexuality, this book is for you.  Zane writes books that gives it to you raw.  It's erotica at it's best, and it makes your imagination run wild.  I enjoyed this book better then the first one.  IMHO this book had more stories I could enjoy.  I will be reading this book.....OFTEN!!!!
