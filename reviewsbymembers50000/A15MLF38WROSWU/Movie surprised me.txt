 This movie was not great, and I also knew not to take this movie serioulsy.  I mean it is a comedy!!!  Rock plays Alderman Gilliam who is about the people.  He wants to help everyone, and he is determined to do so.  He helps a lady save her cat from a building that is about to be demolished, and he is seen as a hero.  He is also the perfect person to run for president and LOSE.  He is made to say recycled speeches that don't mean anything to him, and not be himself.  That is until he takes charge of saying what is truly in his heart and mind, and being himself.  When the person he is running against tries to smear him, Gilliam challenges him to a debate that could make or break his chances at the white house.  The movie surprised me.  I actually liked it. Robin Givens played his girlfriend who wanted nothing to do with him, but once he was running for president she could not plan the wedding quick enough.  SECURITY!!!!  I was loved seeing her get snatched away by security. The movie is cute, and it's fun.
