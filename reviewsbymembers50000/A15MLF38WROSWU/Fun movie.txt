 I thought this movie was a mix of Boomerang and Fatal Attraction.  It had a nice cast (Martin Lawerence, Lynn Whitfield, Bobby Brown (small role, but he did his thing), Regina King).  Ladies man gets caught up when he plays the wrong woman, and becomes a victim of her revenge.  The movie is not super great, but it was a fun movie.  There are parts that will make you laugh.
