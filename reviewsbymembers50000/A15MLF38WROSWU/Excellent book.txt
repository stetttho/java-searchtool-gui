 I know I'm going to have to go back and read the book preceeding this one and read them both.  I enjoyed this book immensely.  I enjoyed the book for the mystery surrounding the murder case and watching the characters grapple with their past and present.  This book is one you won't want to put down until you read the last page!!!  Excellent read.
