 I recall when this movie was being filmed. Lisa Raye did an interview about the movie. The film is about prison being big business. The women are being exploited, abused and enough is enough. The final straw is when one character ends up dies. Lisa Raye plays Francis Shepeard who is in prison for killing her abusive husband. She ends up heading an all out boycott on the prison conditions. Da Brat is Sabrina and she is the narrator. Which is cool, because her acting leaves much to be desired. The movie is okay, but I think the movie would have been better if we could have seen a flashback about Francis' character having to deal with her husband. The movie is okay.
