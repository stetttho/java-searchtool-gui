 When Trois was being promoted, the big deal about the movie was the so called threesome scene.  Turns out the movie should have been advertised as a suspense thriller, not some movie about a threesome.  It was an okay movie, but Pandora's Box was GREAT!!!  I really enjoy this movie.  I would not buy Trois, but I would buy Trois 2 without hesitation.
