 I'm not a big Monica fan.  I usually like a song or two from her, but never enough to purchase a full album from her.  I bought this album after hearing Get It Off on the radio.  This album is actually quite good.  I'm sick of cut #3 and #6 because of too much radio exposure.  The songs I really did like were the following: 2.  Get it off (my workout song) 4. U should have known better 5.  Don't Gotta Go home (also on DMX's album) 9.  Ain't Gonna Cry no more 10.  Go to bed Mad (very nice duet with Tyrese) 11.  Hurts the most 12.  That's my man Monica really showcased her maturity with this project.
