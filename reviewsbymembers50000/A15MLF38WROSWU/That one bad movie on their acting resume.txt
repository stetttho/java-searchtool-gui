 Every actor has that one bad movie on their resume.  Held up is that movie for Jamie Foxx and Nia Long.   When the credits started to run I was so relieved because I did not like this movie.  I did not laugh, and it took all my self control not to open my DVD player, take this movie and toss it like a Frisbee!!!  Michael's (Jamie Foxx) girlfriend finds out he spend their money they were saving for a house on the car they are riding in she gets angry and leaves him in the middle of now where in Nevada.  Michael's cherished car is then stolen while he is in a connivance store, and then the very story is held up by some bumbling crooks.  All Michael wants is to get his car back and find his way to the airport to make up with his girlfriend and beg her forgiveness.  Instead he is trying to negotiate with the backwards law enforcement and the crook to get out unscathed.  I really wanted to like this movie being that I'm such a huge fan of Jamie and Nia's, I even like Jake Busey, but this movie was so pathetic, there was nothing I enjoyed more then returning this movie to the rental place.  Nia's talents were really wasted in this film.  She is in the very beginning, and then mostly in the end.  I don't care how much you want to get away from your man when you are angry, I do not know a single sister who would get on the back of a pick up truck with a bunch of red necks in the middle of nowhere!!!  The jokes were not funny.  Do yourself a favor and pass on this movie.
