 Humorous book looking at health issues, and the problems that bad eating could cause. I had so much fun reading this book. I found myself laughing out loud, and I had visual images of Bill Cosby doing some of what he wrote as a stand up routine. Bill Cosby at age 65 is coming to terms with his health, and how his eating in the past is affecting his current health conditions. He takes a light hearted look at eating, smoking, drinking and even death. He is coming to terms with letting go of his favorite foods, and instead eating healthy (translation BORING in his mind) foods. He is so animated with his story telling, you can't help but laugh when he discusses going to see his girlfriend in 20 degree wearing nothing but a thin cotton school jacket. You will wipe tears from your face as he discusses waiting for the bus, then being so cold all he could do was fall into the bus. Cosby never gets preachy. He even talks about applying for his social security check, so he can secretly buy those "forbidden" foods without his wife knowing.     Some of my favorite quotes that had me in stitches:    "Because on holidays you over eat like a pig and tell yourself: But it's a holiday!" Don't even deny it!!! We all look forward to holidays just so we can get our serious eat on!!     "Women who cook once a year. One by one they file in like gastronomic grim reapers bearing death in a casserole dish."    "My toe nails are made of hot dogs, hoagies, bacon, chocolate and those things I ate."    This is a fun, quick read, that will have you chuckling long after you read the book.
