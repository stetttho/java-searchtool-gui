 I want to know what it will take for people to realize that Dave Hollister is an artist to have in your collection?  I'm a big fan of this man, and he does not get his just due in the industry.  His last two albums got no radio play in Georgia, but I bought them anyway.  I've never been disappointed.  Track #8 Karma is my JAM!!!  This album was good, not his best, but it's a keeper IMHO.
