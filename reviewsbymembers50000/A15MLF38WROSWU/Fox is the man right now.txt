 This movie to me truly showed Fox's acting capabilities!!!  With this poignant film, he has shown that he really takes his acting seriously.  This performance is as good as his performance in Ali!!!  This film based on the life of gang cofounder and death row inmate Stanley "Tookie" Williams.  What kept me so mesmerized was to the story was not only the great acting, but the fact that Mr. Williams truly realized the error of his way, he recognized his ignorance, and he was sorry, and he wanted to share his true story to prevent other young men from doing the same ignorant thing he did.  The very thing he started, he wanted to bring to an end.  The fact that someone in prison won a Nobel Peace Prize was amazing.  While watching this film you could feel the different emotions.  You can feel his anger, and then his remorse.  When you can feel emotion, you know you know you have yourself a good quality film, with good quality acting.   I feel this is an important and very worthwhile film.  A film that I hope will be seen by the audience that should really see it.  The youth who think their only option is to join a gang, and live the life they live.  This film truly shows that no matter your situation, if you want to make a positive change and positive impact on the lives of others you can.
