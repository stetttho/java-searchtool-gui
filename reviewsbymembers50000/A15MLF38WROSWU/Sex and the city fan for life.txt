 I just love this show.  I saw part of season 1, so it was fun to be able to get the DVD and watch the whole season. It took me two days, but it was worth it. My favorite episode is the one where Carrie farts in front of big. I kept rewinding that scene because it was so funny.  The show was well cast.  Samantha gave new meaning to sexual liberation.  If you never saw the show, go on and treat yourself to the DVD.  You will find yourself watching the show every now and again with your girlfriends.
