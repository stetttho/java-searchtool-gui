 I'm not into Nsync, or the Backstreet boys, but I'm loving me some Justin!!!  I had no intentions of buying this album.  Then I heard "Cry me a River".  Why did he have to sing that song, and why did I have to love that song!!!  So I bought the album and too my surprise.....I LIKE IT, I REALLY LIKE IT!!!  Go figure.
