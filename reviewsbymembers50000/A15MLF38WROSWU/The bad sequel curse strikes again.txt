 This movie was described as terrifying.  It was BORING!!!!  In fact I wish I could give this movie a thumbs down instead of one star.  This movie deserves a big fat ZERO rating.   There was nothing terrifying about this movie at all.  When a so called scary scene would happen it would get lame again.  The movie stars Jon Bon Jovi as vampire hunter Derek Bliss.  He is sent on assignment in Mexico to hunt and kill a quick moving vampire names Una.  Una had some nice moves, but they did not last long enough.  She would come at you quick, and get you with her sharp nails before sinking her teeth into you.  He has to recruit other hunters and ends up with Zooey who may or may not be a blood sucker herself.  Father Rodriqgo, Sancho, and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary from Family Matters).  Ray Collins is this gruff sounding (actually pathetic gruff sounding) vampire hunter.  The voice was so bad, all I could do was laugh.  Zooey take a medicine that helps her control her vampire urges, but when she loses the medicine Derek has to make a choice if she is worth saving.  You get very little gore, terrible acting, and why folks think this movie is better then Vampires is a mystery.  This is a horrible, horrible sequel, and it?s not better then Vampires!!!  If you have nothing better to do, then watch this movie at your own risk.  Better yet,  rent some better Vampire movies.  See Vampires, Blade, Blade 2, From Dusk till Dawn, and the Lost Boys.
