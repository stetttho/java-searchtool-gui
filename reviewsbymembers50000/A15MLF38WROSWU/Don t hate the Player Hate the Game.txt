 We meet up again with the Duncan?s, but this time we get to meet Trent the playa who is a straight up D-O-G, and his sister Melanie.  We also get to meet Michelle, Trent?s baby mama who is determined to make him take responsibility for his son. The book starts off with Will and Denise. They have moved on from the trouble they went through in Married men, but now they have a new problem.  Denise is not being intimate with Wil and he has a new temp that is more then willing to pick up the slack!!!  Maxine is the temp with a few screws loose, but by the time anyone relizes just how far she is willing to go to get Wil, it may be too late.  Trent is a man who breaks hearts and is trying to avoid his baby mama.  He meets Indigo, and convinces her he is a music producer and can get her singing career off the ground.  Somehow he finds himself engaged to not just Indigo, but also Michelle.  Now he is trying to figure out how he can keep Michelle happy with just the ring so he can marry Indigo for a big pay day (I told you he was a D-O-G!!!!).  Melanie has fallen in love with Prince, but she has to be careful, because someone she trusted is trying to take her man!!!  I started this book at 9am and 6 hours later I was done.  Your imagination will bring these characters to life, and you won?t let go until you get to the last page. You won?t want to turn on the TV or answer your phone.  The book is predictable, but very, very enjoyable.  I would love to see a future story developed with Indigo (life after Trent), and I?m looking forward to his next book Preachers Son which comes out in 2005.
