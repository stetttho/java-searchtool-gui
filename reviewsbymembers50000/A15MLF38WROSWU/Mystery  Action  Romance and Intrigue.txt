 If I could have lived the pages of this book!!!  I like a book that grabs me from the first page and won't let go.  That's what this book did. Raleigh is my Shero.  Stubborn, strong willed and gutsy!!  Then Adam is suave and and tries to hide how he really feels about Raleigh because he feels she killed a good friend of his.  Turns out everything they both know is not true.  Together they discover truth and fall in love.
