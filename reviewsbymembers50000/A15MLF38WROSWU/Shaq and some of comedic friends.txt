 This was actually okay to watch, and somewhat funny.  The comics that appeared made fun of Shaq's acting, his big feet, and his lack of free throw ability.  I was just wondering if Bill Bellamy got dressed in the dark because his outfit was horrible!!!  In fact Joe Torry picked on him about his outfit.  "Bill Bellamy has his own Eddie Murphy Kit."  I liked it when someone said "People think he has big cars because he has money, no he don't fit in nothing!!!"    The comics were Tommy Davidson, Dick Gregory, Mark Curry, Micheal Colyar, DL Hughley, Cedrick the Entertainer, Steve Harvey, Monique, Jimmy Kimmel, Joe Torry.   Bill Bellamay snaps back at Shaq after being teased about his outfit.  "Shaq looks like a super Usher."  Mark Curry talks about how cheap Shaq was.  "He makes 100 million dollars and he flew us in on Southwest airlines.  Cheap, the man is cheap."  Tommy Davidson:  "Roaches are afraid of the boys feet."  Jimmy Kimmel:  "What's with the rapping? You can barely speak."  "There are a lot of Armani suites, lot of Gucci suits and a lot of paternity suits."  Talking about Shaq starring in Kazzam "that movie was so bad they would not show it in the Magic Johnson Theater."  Joe Torry:  "Take fighting advice from Holyfield, but don't ask him for condoms, he does not have any!!!"  DL Hugly:  "More scarey than an earthquake is Shaq coming out with another album. I will dress like a free throw and you will never hit me."  The DVD also included three of Shaq's music videos.  Straight Playing, You can't stop the rain, and The way it's going down.  There is some behind the scenes footage, but it's rather dull.  This is a good DVD to watch once, maybe twice, but it's not worth owning.  You will get some laughs.
