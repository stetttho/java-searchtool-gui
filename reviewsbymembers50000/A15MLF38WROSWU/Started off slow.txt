 I've read a lot of reviews where people said Season 5 is not all that great.  Well it does start off slow.  I guess they got thrown off by Sarah's pregnancy.  When I watched the first DVD of Season 5 I was not all that impressed.  But by the end of of the DVD I had episodes I laughed at.   anchors away - was rather dull unoriginal sin - was okay, but still did not wow me luck be an old lady - This episode made me laugh.  The scene when they told off the guy in the casino.....I kept watching that scene over and over.  Also is it me, but Miranda seems to have lost some of her spunk after giving birth.  Because the old Miranda would have told that guy off!!!  cover girl - my favorite episode on the DVD.
