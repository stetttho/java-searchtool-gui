 I'm glad I got this CD for Free from my music club, because this CD is not Chico's best effort.  The songs I did enjoy: 2. Free 4. Smile 6. Style 7. Home Alone 10. Questions 11. Availability He had a couple of songs where he tried to do the Brian McNight high pitched singing and it did NOT work.  Maybe his next effort will be much better.  I expect a lot more from Chico, but he slipped with this project.
