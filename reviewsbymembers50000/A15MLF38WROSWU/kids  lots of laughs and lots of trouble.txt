 This movie was hilarious!!  I really enjoyed it.  The movie is about a family who deals with change when both parents decide to pursue their career dreams, and even more chaos ensues.  You have a bunch of children who don't want to move, leave their school and friends, getting used to new schools, and playing major pranks on each other and on a boyfriend.  You have one child who feels like an outsider, but the other siblings do really love him.  Years ago this couple only wanted 8 children, but when they had a set of twins, decided to go for an even number.  So they ended up with 12.  You have one child who is a fashion person, very into her looks, make up and clothing.  The oldest child has moved out, has her own life, and is trying to get her family to understand that.  She is dating her boyfriend who is an actor her siblings don't like.   The scene that is so funny and I kept watching over and over and over again was the scene when the dog attacks the boyfriend whose shorts were soaked in meat.  He is grabbing the floor and his screams reach a falsetto that just had me laughing and crying so hard.  I love that scene!!!!  Then he leaves the house and is chased by more dogs and has to jump in his car.  What a riot!!!!   The story is ultimately about finding a happy medium, and deciding what is more important.  Career or family. It is possible to have both, but at what costs?  This movie is fun for the entire family to watch.
