 TCF CREW  This is a nice album.  I wonder what happened to this group?  This CD has mostly mid-temp grooves with 1 or 2 dance tracks.  This album has songs that talk about love and sex without being overt.  I mainly purchased this album because I was a fan of the song "Hardest Working Lover."  Too bad the album does not have the remix version of the song that has the rap, that's the version I was hoping was on the album.   The remix version had a more urban flavor.  The version on the album is nice.  The whole album is good and very playable.    Favorite cuts:  1. Go to the Horses Mouth  2. I ain't the one  4. Get your Shhh right  7. Fantasy  8. Hardest Working Lover 11. Body Come True 12. Come into my Love 15. Play me  Track 14 is a teaser song.  WTCF (Hit Radio)  Sounds like a compilation of songs that did not make the album.  Everytime I put this CD in my CD player I just groove all day long.  This is a nice old school CD.  It would have been nice for this group to release another album.
