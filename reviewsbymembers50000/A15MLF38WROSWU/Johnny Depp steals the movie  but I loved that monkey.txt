 I know a lot of people loved Johnny, but I happen to like that cute little monkey!! Jack is a pirate played by Johnny Depp, and he does a great job, no make that excllent job.  He actually makes pirates likeable, and laughable.  What I enjoyed the most about the movie was the special effects.  That scene when you see all the skeleton's in the moonlight, and then they look human again was phenomenal!!!  This movie is fun, and it's wonderful for the whole family to enjoy.
