 I'm sorry, but I did not like this film. I'm glad I did not pay to see this in theaters. I saw it on TV (cable), and was not pleased with the film at all. Bad acting, and a waste of film. The movie was not scary, and it was predictable. Truth is just watch the first 4 Freddy movies. Those are the BEST ones in the series.
