 Regina, Toni, and Victoria are all friends who are going through different stages in their lives.  Regina is married to Russel who wants her to just be a housewife and mother.  He does not want to hear that she has goals of her own outside of the home.  Victoria is a woman who thinks just because she is married to a white man that she "has made it".  Toni is a woman who wants "perfection" and is always trying to change her husband Charles.  She wants him to aim high and be better then he is, not realizing he is perfectly happy with his accomplishments just as they are.  This book really hits home about self esteem.  The book hits on the issue of color that the black community tends to ignore.  The book also touches on interracial marriage.  I'm a big fan of Donna Hill and loved her Arabesque Romance books, but this book is a step up for sure.  This is the kind of book that will make you take stock of your own life.  Excellent read and looking forward to reading more from Donna Hill.
