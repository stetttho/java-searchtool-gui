 I enjoy this whole album.  Everytime I listen to this CD I feel so much better about my day, and my faith is recharged.  I like I never have to skip a song when I listen to this CD.  There are so many times I press repeat and just let a song repeat 2-4 times and start singing right along.  Yolanda was blessed with a beautiful voice, and her songs are always right on time.  This is one album you should have as part of your gospel collection.  Yolanda gives her all in every song she sings.  Believe is an excellent, excellent album.    These are the songs I will repeat when I need to recharge my spirit:  2.  I gotta believe 6.  Unconditional 7.  Anything 8.  Only if God Says Yes 12.  I'm thankful  I'm thankful is different from what Yolanda usually does.  Her songs are usually mid-tempo or slow temp songs, but this one is upbeat and hip.  It was a treat for me, and a song I love working out to.   Some of the wonderful Lyrics to Thankful:  You're there to pick me up Whenever I fall down And I can't say enough 'Bout the things you've done for me Without you in my life I don't know where I'd be Release my heart felt praise Gonna life my voice and sing.  Chorus Gonna raise my hands up to the sky Use every breath to glorify Your name your work your way 'Cause I'm so thankful For life, for health, for strength to live For sharing love and fellowship For every blessing that you give  I'm thankful  I'm thankful there is an artist as talented and annointed like Yolanda to spread her words of inspiration through music.  This is an album you must have in your collection.
