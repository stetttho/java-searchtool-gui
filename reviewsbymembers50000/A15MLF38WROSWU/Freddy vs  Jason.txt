 Finally after years of waiting, the movie came out.  Me being a Freddy fan I was in his corner.  It was an interesting movie.  If you like both, then you probably won't care who does what to whom.  If you are a big Jason fan, you will enjoy it, if you are a Freddy fan you will enjoy it.  I loved the gore!!!  What's a horror movie without some gore!!!!   Maybe they can do a Michael Myers vs. Jason next?
