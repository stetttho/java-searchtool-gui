 This is a great sophmore effort from Pink.  Family Portrait is one of my favorite songs, and one I will never get tired of.  Pink has a great voice, and should not be put in the same category as Britney, or even Christina (who also has a great voice).  Misery, Numb are other notable songs on this great album.  Good one to have in the collection.
