 When I first started the book, it took me some time to get into it.  The writing style is different, but once I got into the character Mingus, it was hard to put down the book.  The story is about Mingus.  She has a great career, but her personal life is not all that good.  Her relationships never seem to last, she does not get along with her sister, and she is grappling with changes in her family.  She is bi-racial, but always identified herself as black.  When she gets involved with a white man she has to question if she is doing the right thing, then she meets Eric who is a black man and that complicates things even further.  When she thinks she has finally found the love of her life, a bombshell is dropped that rocks her to the core.  When she cries, you will want to cry.  You want her to find that happiness that we often times think is elusive.  I'm looking forward to reading Jenoyne's next book.
