 This is Price's best CD and it did not get promoted well.  I'm a huge fan of Price and I'm really glad I bought this CD.  Price has a strong voice.  A real voice, a voice that sounds even better Live.  The one low point on this CD was her collaberation with Keith Murray.  Aside of that I liked almost all the songs on this CD.   2. Someday - nice gospel sounding CD 5.  Sisters - Beautiful song with Faith Evans 6.  Again - nice song with some Latino guitar flavor 8.  Strong Man - very, very, nice song.  One I play a lot reminds me of my man.  :)  #7 is  a nice lude with very nice music that would have made a nice full song.   9.  How does it feel - Price really shocases her voice on this song.  This CD is just awesome.
