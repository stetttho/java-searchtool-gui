 I will admit at times the book did tend to drag.  I still kept reading it because I wanted to know who committed the crime.  Family full of greedy, selfish people.  All except Bailey Walker and her husband.  Bailey is a loving wife and mother who has a catering business.  By her family she is seen as the Goody Two shoes.  Perfect to take the fall for a crime.  The book is mysterious.  My only complaint, the book had a strange ending.
