 I'm a former New Yorker who is a diehard NBA fan (New York Knicks).  When I first heard about this book coming out I was wondering if I would like the book.  I finally read it, and I enjoyed this book.  When you think about being in this type of situation, you think everything is wonderful.  The book showed that everything that glitters is not gold.  You have a player who is confused about his sexuality, the woman who wants revenge for being dumped, a woman who is afraid to stand up to her gambling basketball player husband, a young player who keeps putting off a marriage to his girlfriend who feels very unappreciated, and a woman who is trying to come to terms with her husbands cheating, and the rebuilding of trust.  The book is fiction, but you can't help but wonder how much of what you read has really happened.  The gambling basketball player reminded of a player in the NBA who shall remain nameless. I enjoyed the peak into the lives of these characters.  I was overjoyed when Trina finally got some backbone and stood up to her husband.  I cried for Kelly when she left Mitchell.  I was rooting for Casey, who on the outside seemed so strong, but she was really battling with some insecurities.   The book had a lot of characters, and some that did not get developed and did not seem poignant to the story.  I saw where a reviewer felt Kelly was due something.  Kelly was not due a cent!!!  She showed herself to be a true gold digger and a manipulator!!!  She lied about who the father was.  She was the character you love to hate!!!  The book is a page turner, you will find yourself reading into the wee hours of the night just to find out what happens, and the ending is sweet.  Very enjoyable.
