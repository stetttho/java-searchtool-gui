 Can Ryan save the world from a terrible war?  Well we can only hope.  Ben Affleck has been cast as Ryan, and he actually surprised me.  He takes over for Harrison Ford who had the part in previous films.  He was really good in the role.  He brings something new and different to the role.  I watched this movie more because of Morgan Freeman then Ben Affleck.  I know I'm dating myself, but I've been a Morgan Freeman fans since seeing him on the Electric Company on PBS.  Ryan is a rookie who helps to unravel a plot that could have the Russians and America at war with one another.  A nuclear bombs goes off in Baltimore and the two countries point the fingers at one another.  Morgan plays Affleck's boss and friend in this film , and his performance is outstanding.  There is a touch of comedy that takes the edge off in the flim, but you never lose fact of the terror and drama in the film.  I've rented this film 4 times so far.  I think I will end up buying this one to add to my collection.  It's not often I like a movie with Ben in it.
