 You Are Making Me Wet" by Earl Sewell - The best story in the book.  This story was funny, and sweet.  I enjoyed it, and will read this one again. "Life Happens" by Rique Johnson - was interesting.  The story kept my attention. "The Wanting" by Michael Presley - another interesting story, and it had a nice little hidden message.   "Legal Days, Lonely Nights" by William Fredrick Cooper - This story started off slow, picked up and by then end you were catching your breath.  "Somewhere Between Love and Sarcasm" by V. Anthony Rivers - This was the WORST story in the book.  There was nothing erotic about it, and it was no where between love and sarcasm.  The story was all Sarcasm and it was stupid and had no business in the book.   My suggestion is read all the stories in this book EXCEPT Somewhere Between Love and Sarcasm.  Trust me you will not miss anything by not reading this story.
