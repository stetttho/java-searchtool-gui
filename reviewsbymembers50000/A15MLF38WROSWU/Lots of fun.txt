 Jules Potter is in love with her bdest friend Micheal, but he is about to marry someone else.  Jules will do anything to mess up his big day.  This movie is loads of fun and laughs.  When they break out into song in one scene, you can't help but sing along.  I love this movie and watch it often.  It's one of my favorites with Roberts next to Pretty Woman.
