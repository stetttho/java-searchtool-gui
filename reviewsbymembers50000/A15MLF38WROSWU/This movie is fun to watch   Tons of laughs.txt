 I really, really enjoyed this movie.  I don't know much about Greek culture, but I was able to relate to the topic anyway.  I have friends who are of other ethnic backgrounds who ran into the same problem the Toula did.  Falling in love with someone who is not of their culture, and the differences it can bring.  I really liked the comedic spin of this film.  I thought that Nia Vardalos did an incredible job using humor to show what it means to be a Greek American.    Toula is in her 30's, single, and working in the family business.  She is under tremendous pressure to marry and have children by her traditional father.  Toula on the other hand has other plans that her father can't understand.  He cannot understand why she would want to return to school, and he is not into the who modern values thinking like she is.  Her mother wants her daughter to be happy, and understands what Toula wants.  Toula has a crush on Ian Miller(John Corbet of Sex and the City), and when a relationship forms, Toula has to come to terms with their differences, and come to terms with how her family will accept her handsome boyfriend.  When they get engaged, it's funny to watch how the groom's parents are besieged by Toula's large family and their customs.    You do not have to be Greek to enjoy this movie.  I thought it was quite funny, and enjoyable.  I felt this movie deserved the hype it received.  Toula's father using Windex to cure all his ailments was funny.  Strange, but funny.  If you enjoy good comedies, you must watch this movie.
