 This book had me laughing so much.  I really enjoyed this book.  While reading this book you can't help but fall in love with the children, and if you could you would want to hug them through the pages. In addition to being comical, the book was also erotic.  The love scenes will have your heart racing.  This has been added as one of my favorite books that I will read often.
