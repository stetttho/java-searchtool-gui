 I was so happy to get to the end of the book.  I wanted more dialogue with Jeff and Sheila.  For once I was happy that a mother got in the middle of her daughters life.  Sheila upset me with her selfishness.  Jeff had a dream, but all she wanted to do was hold a grude because Jeff choose to enter the space program.  Then she made the man suffer even though he tried to apologize.  Upset me to know end.  There are so many women that do that.  His dream was THEIR dream, but she did not WANT to see it.  The book was average.
