 I bought this expecting this to be something like My Brother and Me was.  They had different remixes of Salt Shaker and I was hoping they would have different Mixes of Wait - The Whisper song.  I was especially hoping Still United would have the version that featured Busta Rhymes, Missy Elliott, Lil Scrappy, and Free.   I feel like the Ying Yang Twins hang out in strip clubs and that seems to be the inspiration for some of their songs. They don't say anything profound, but some of the beats on some of the songs end up grabbing you and that's why I pay this group any attention all.   The DVD is fun to watch.  So if you like having the music videos and performances, that's worth having for sure.  The music videos on the DVD are Wait, Shake and Badd.  The making of the DVD feature is also really nice.  My favorite TV appearance is when the Ying Yang twins are on Adam Corolla's show.  That interview is so comical. Adam talks about the fact they have the bling, bling in their mouth, and how silly it is.    This CD is basically a collection of the songs that did not make the USA CD.  Ms. New Booty is on the Bubba Sparxx CD, and Git IT is on the Bun B CD.  If you are a die hard Ying Yang fan, then this CD is worth buying.  Otherwise it's really nothing special.  I ended up getting it as a gift from someone.    There are only certain artist who can do Hip Hop slow jams, and the Ying Tang Twins are not one of them!!!  Bedroom Boom?  I did not like that cut at all.  Out of the 12 cuts on the CD only 5 will get some play.  The Cuts I did like 2 - wiggle then move 3 - Ms. New Booty 4- Git it 11- Wait 12- Shake Remix
