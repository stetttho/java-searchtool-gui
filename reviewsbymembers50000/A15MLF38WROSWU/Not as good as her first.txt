 I was very eager to read Selah's Bed after reading Resurrecting Mingus.  I did not enjoy Selah's Bed at all.  I pretty much figured out why Selah was doing what she did, but the story never really grabbed me.  The story is not just about Selah, but her Grandmother who has a drug problem.  The author has a unique lyrical way of writing, but I just did not enjoy this particular story.
