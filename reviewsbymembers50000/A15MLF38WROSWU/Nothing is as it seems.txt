 When you watch this movie you will remember two things.  "Everything is a test", and Nothing is as it seems."  You will find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen next.  Is this a test, or is this the real thing you will ask yourself over and over again.  James Clayton is still dealing with his Father's disappearance.  James is recruited by Walter Burke to join the CIA, but James will find that nothing is at it seems, and he will realize he can't trust anyone but himself.  The movie is intense, and a great thriller.  I liked the peek into the CIA and the recruiting process.  Al Pachino and Colin Farral were good together in this film.
