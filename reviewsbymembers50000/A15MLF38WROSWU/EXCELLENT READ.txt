 I've enjoyed every book in this the Hideaway Legacy series, and this will probably be my new favorite.  The characters were well developed.  Enjoyed the romance aspects with the suspense mixed in.  Jolene's character was a strong character and I just may take up kickboxing after reading this book! Micheal was so loving and protected his love with aggression.  Now I know a guy like him is out there somewhere!  This was a great book.  Deserves 6 stars, not just five.
