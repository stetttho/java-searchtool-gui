 This book had me holding my breath.  You knew their relationship was headed for trouble if they did not fix things. Their lack of attention towards each other and communication are the main things that lead other marriages to divorce court.  Keeping secrets did not make things better.  Taking a trip together was just what the doctor orderd.  Helped them find their passion, but most of all it helped them learn about themselves as individuals and as a team.  This was a wonderful book!... Hoping she writes on about Elise's father finding his next love of his life.  That would make for an interesting story.
