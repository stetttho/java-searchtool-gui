 I'm going to be honest.  I'm not a diehard Trekie.  I've watched some of the shows over the years, and I've watched the movies when I could.  I happen to really enjoy this film.  After a wedding between Number 1 and Troy the team find themselves facing a clone of Captain Picard.  The clone is determined to cause trouble and won't stop at anything to get his way.  He even manages to place a Data "clone" to steal some information for him to use against the team.  He manipulates the Romulan empire to help him in his quest to take over federation.  He refuses to admit just how much he needs Picard, and Picard is banking that if he is a clone, that he has some of Picards goodness in him.  I thought this movie was really good.  I was on the edge of my seat during the battles between the ships.  The movie was action packed and really good.  I will be adding this one to my Sci-Fi collection.
