 I know this album is old, but I was jamming to it in my car the other day and had to write a review.  When this album first came out in '99 I really thought Sole would be the new woman to represent females in Hip Hop.  It's been 6 years, and with the exception of hearing about her getting married to Genuine she has vanished from the public eye. Her debut album Skin Deep is not to be slept on.  She is tough, but her femininity still shines through.  She has her own sound, and did not see the need to try to sound like anyone else.  I remember when I first heard her on JT Money's track Who Dat (which is on her album as well) I was impressed by her voice.  She also did not let her beauty hinder her tough edge one bit.  In fact I would say it motivated her to not be just another pretty face trying to be a hip hop artist.    She has some good flows.  She let's you know she is not to be messed over, and unlike some other female hip hop artist did not resort to being downright nasty, and trifling.  I'm really disappointed she has not released another CD, but hope she will eventually.  I still run Skin Deep, the CD is really good.   Favorite Cuts: Da Story 3.  Iy Yi Yi 5.  4,5,6 6.
