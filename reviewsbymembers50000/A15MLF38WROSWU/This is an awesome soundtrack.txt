 I just finished watching School Daze on DVD this weekend, and I've been humming one of my favorite songs since.  "We've only said goodbye."  I enjoy all the songs on the soundtrack, but this song is my absolute favorite.  I have this soundtrack on Vinyl, but not having a turn table I'm not able to listen to it.  Well knowing I can finally buy this soundtrack on CD will change all of that.  This was when soundtracks were well put together, and the songs were from the movie.  I used to play my vinyl copy all the time.    My favorite songs on the soundtrack are the following:  2.  Perfect Match - this is such a sexy song 3.  Be alone tonight - Tish sings the heck out of this song!!!  4.  Straight and Nappy 9.  Be One - by the late Phyllis Hyman 11. We've Already Said Goodbye(Before we said hello)  This is a must have for your CD collection.
