 This book was short on a lot of things.  Excitement, good story line, and did I mention it was short on excitement.  On one hand I was excited to read a book by a brother, the plot at first had possibilities. The book is about a man who wants to figure out where he went wrong in his relationship and try to salvage it if he can with one of three women.   The only reason I finished the book was due to the chapters being short!!!  If you can please borrow this book from the library!!!!!!  It was a yawner.
