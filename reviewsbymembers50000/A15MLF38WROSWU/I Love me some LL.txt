 I own all his albums.  ALL OF THEM.  Now I'm not going to sit here and act like they are all good.  They aren't.  He can boast about being the GREATEST OF ALL TIMES....  LL has longetvity and is the man who can do those smooth raps that the ladies love!!!  Throw Your L's up, Big Mamma (makes me all teary eyed), Mirror, Mirror, Niggy Nuts, and fa ha show why he is the Greatest!!!  ...
