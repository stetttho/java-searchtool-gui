 Three women who have great careers but do not want to have love interfere with their lives.  The three women have formed a sisterhood because they are all business women and they have had relationship problems.  Brenda Jackson weaves three stories into one book, but I honestly would have like to see each woman with her own book.  This book is mostly about Brandy, and I feel Amber and Carla's stories don't develop as fully as they should.  In this book not only do the women have past relationship issues, but do the men.  Cord is dealing with a wife who left him for another man and took all the money in their accounts.  Cord is smitten with Amber, but it takes her some time to warm up to Cord.  Grey Master's is hired to help protect Brandy after she gets some notes threatening her.  He has not gotten over the fact his wife left him for another man, and died in the process.  In addition to protecting her, he is trying to protect his heart.  Jesse finds out that Carla is the mother of his son, and he will do everything he has to be an active part of his son's life.  Even though Carla would rather he stay away.   Brenda has a way of weaving real life situations, romance, drama and mystery that make you feel like you are part of the story.  Excellent book.
