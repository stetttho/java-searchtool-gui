 This is a cute romantic comedy, that will leave you laughing, and laughing some more.  You have Adina, Clyde, Montell and Brandy.  Adina and Brandy are friends who meet Clyde and Montell (who are also friends) at a party.  Adina is the typical "you have to have serious money to date me" type of attitude.  The more money a guy has, the better your chance of dating her.  Clyde thinks he is a player, but he is actually a faker.  He has keys to a Porsche that does not belong to him, and he goes to banks to get bank slips that don't belong to him with high bank balances to show he has money.  Adina gets a peek at one of his bank slips gets woozy, and Clyde offers to take her home.  When Adina finds out later that Clyde is not "clocking major figures" she take his car, and he chases her down in a hilarious scene.  After all of that turns out Brandy and Montell date, and Clyde and Adina can't have that!!!  They set out to ruin the relationship, and chaos ensues. The movie is very funny, and it's a wonderful romantic comedy.   There is this one scene that is so hilarious, I still find myself laughing so hard I have tears running down my face.   Adina wears plenty of wigs.  She could Regine a run for her money!!!  I also enjoy the talk Montel gives when he talks about loving, and loving hard.  This is a must see movie in my opinion.
