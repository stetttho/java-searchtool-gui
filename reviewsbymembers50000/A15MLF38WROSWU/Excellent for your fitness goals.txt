 I have many books in my house about fitness.  Joyce Vedral, Corey Everson, and some others.  This book really breaks it down.  The one thing my other books do not say is this "Change how you eat, your cardio vascular activity and your weight training" every 14 days!!!  It does make sense.  This way your body does not get used to your routine.  My gym buddy lent me her copy of the book, and I will be purchasing mine right away.  I will carry this with me to the gym.  I plan to flag and highlight this book like crazy.   If you workout at a gym, then ladies this books is for you!!!!
