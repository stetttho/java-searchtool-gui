 I was foolish for renting this film.  I like Eddie Griffin, he is talented, and funny so I was kind of hoping it would be kind of decent.  Huge mistake!!!  This is NOT a must see movie.  The only thing you can do is leave this film on the shelves. Master P really needs to give up the acting dream.  Either give it up or take some lessons!!!  He is a dull and unemotional as an actor.  It's painful to watch.  The movie is about two brothers overcoming their differences and eventually coming together for a common goal.  Master P wants Foolish to do comedy at his club he is opening.    Andrew Dice Clay has a forgettable cameo appearance in the movie.  The talented supporting cast really wasted their acting chops in this film (Marla Gibbs as their grandmother, Bill Nunn, Jr. Bill Duke and Clifton Powell).  This movie has a weak story line.  I have a sense of humor, but I need for my movies to entertain me in all aspects and this movie does not do that.  This movie tried to do too much.  It tired to funny, dramatic and it did not work.  It was like trying to mix and oil and water in this film.    Save yourself the trouble and rent or purchase Dysfunktional Family.  A lot of the jokes Eddie G does in this film he will do in Dysfunktional Family. In fact even My Babies Daddy (Eddie G stars in that as well) is better then Foolish, and even that movie was not all that great, but I laughed while watching that, and hardly even chuckled while watching Foolish.  After you sit through this movie all you will do is hold your head saying ugggghhhhhh!!   I've seen it, and I will never watch this movie again.  I won't be foolish twice.    Rent these movies with Eddie Griffin instead: 1.  My Babies Daddy 2.  Dysfunktional Family 3.  Undercover Brother
