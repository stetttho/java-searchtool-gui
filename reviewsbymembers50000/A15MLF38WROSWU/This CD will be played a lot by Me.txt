 I played this past weekend, and enjoyed it alot. I have all of Missy's CD's right now I have this ranked as my 2nd favorite from her.  Her first CD will always be number 1 for me.   Tracks I enjoyed:  2. Pass that Dutch  8. Don't be cruel (Beenie did his thing on this track!!! )  9. Toyz 10. Let it Bump 11.  Pump it up 15.  I'm not perfect (on the spiritual tip)  This is a good album, and IMHO worth the money.
