 I am now a Carl Weber fan!!!  I've had this book sitting in my house for about a year and I've just finished reading it.  Wish I had not waited so long. This man is an excellent writer.  You will find yourself laughing, and laughing a lot.   Carl Weber has this way of writing that will have you talking to the pages.   Kevin is a former NBA player turned gym teacher who leaves a voicemail on 1-900-Black Luv and shares the info with his friends.  English teacher Antoine and Security guard Tyrone.  Kevin first meets Alicia, but Alicia has past relationship issues she is trying to work on.  When things do not go well with Alicia he meets Denise.  Denise happens to be white and at first Kevin is not comfortable with that, but she convinces him to be "friends".  Turns out she thinks she can buy his affection, and tries to control his life also. She turns into a psychotic when Kevin tries to dump her.  Can you say Drama!!!  Antoine is an English teacher who uses the line to share his poetry.  He falls hard for Shawna, but hairstyles Keisha will do what ever it takes to get his attention.  Tyrone ends up with Sylvia, a lonely housewife and he is determined to give her all the attention her husband won't.  What he does not realize is Sylvia is married to his boss.
