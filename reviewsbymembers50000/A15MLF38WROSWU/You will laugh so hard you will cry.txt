 I was so happy to find out this was coming out on DVD.  I owned the video of this and watched it so much I ended up wearing the tape out.  This to me is Bill Cosby at his stand up best.  After all these years I still find myself laughing hard, with tears running down my face like it's the first time I've seen his performance.  Bill Cosby is an awesome story teller.  Hiss set is simple.  The stage, and a chair.  He tells a story and he really has something to talk about.  Unlike some of the comedians to today that cuss to fill in the space where they ran out of things to say.  Bill Cosby knew how to be funny without all the foul language.    I love it when he talks about his wife going into labor and grabbing his bottom lip and lifting it over his head screaming "I want morphine!!!!!"  "Mom can't have drugs; the father can have all the drugs he wants."  He talks about how his parents want to get into heaven and treats the grandchildren better then they treated him as a child.  Brain damaged children, feeding chocolate cake to the children for breakfast.  How fathers are more fun then Moms because fathers are allowed to have gas.  The Baby poo poo.  He talks about being high and laughing for no reason.  Drugs and paranoia, Getting drunk, going to the Dentist.  Brain Damaged children saying "I don't know" when you ask them a question.    You can appreciate the material because you can relate to it.  Some of what Bill talks about you may have experience yourself, and now you can laugh about it if you did not laugh about it before.  Granted the sound quality is not the best, but considering this was taped in 1982 you can't really be too upset.  Just turn up the volume and enjoy!!!  This is a wonderful, wonderful DVD you should own to round out your stand up comedy collection.  You will watch this over and over, and laugh each time you view this DVD.
