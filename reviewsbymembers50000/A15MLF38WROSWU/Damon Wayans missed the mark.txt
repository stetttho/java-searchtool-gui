 I'm very happy I did not pay $8.75 to see this movie in theaters. The movie is one of those you watch when you have nothing better to do, and want to burn some brain cells. There were some moments you can't help but laugh at. Overall the movie is just okay, it's not grab your sides, and fall on the floor laugh, but there were some funny moments.
