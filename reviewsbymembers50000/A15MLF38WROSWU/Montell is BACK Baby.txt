 I LOVE Montell Jordan.  I love him as much as I love Dave Hollister.  Montell is not getting his props at all, and it's a shame.  I was very upset when his 5th album was not released in the US.  Life after def Montell lets his fans know he is not going anywhere, and he will keep doing his thing.   I enjoy the following cuts the most: 2.  Aight 4. I'm going crazy 6.  Bottom Line 7.  What if I never 8. crushin 9.  Make up sex 12.  Questions 13.  Yes I Love how Montell always throw in that Gospel song at the end of his albums.  If you purshase this album, you won't regret it!!!  Go and buy this one!!!
