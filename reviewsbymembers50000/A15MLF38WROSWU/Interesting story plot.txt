 I usually don't like this author's work.  I was sure I would not enjoy this one, but I was wrong.  Maura is willing to do anything to save her grandfather's life.  Her beloved grandfather is suffering from a terrible illness.  Maura does not have the money for a much needed operation that could save her father's life.  A wealthy old flame enters her life and is the answer to all her prayers.  She marries him, just so she can help him realize his dream of becoming a father.  What Josh does not count on is actually falling in love and making this a true marriage.  Not just a business venture.  Nice story.
