 One of the reasons Thomas is my favoite author!!!  I loved this book, had such a beautiful ending.  Elle has been in love for so long with Brennan, but he can't bring himself to fall in love with her.  Elle is hurt when she realizes her marriage is not of love, but "friendship".  Elle determined to have Brennan's love makes him see her love for him is true.  Great story.
