 I'm not sure what the expectations where for other people who read this book, but I was pleased with what I read. "Duplicity" - was a fun story to read.  I thought I had it figured out, and then got caught off guard.  I don't want to give anything away, but I think this is one story that will be enjoyed in the book.   "Lessons Learned" a nice story.  "The Adventures of the Bold and Bourgeois" this story was a fun read.  It ended rather abrubtly, but it was still nice.  "Delusions" - this story was GREAT!!!!  It's the kind of story that would keep you away from internet dating.   "Your Message Has Been Sent" - was the only story I did not like in the book.  It just did not grab me or keep my interest.   All in all the book was not bad.
