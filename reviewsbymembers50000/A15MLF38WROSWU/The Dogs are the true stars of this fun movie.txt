 This film is hilarious!!!  I wish I had seen this movie sooner.  I laughed, and laughed, and laughed some more!!!  Dr. Brooks is a dentist with a wonderful dental practice in Miami.  He finds out he has to go to Alaska, and his mother has to finally reveal a secret that will turn his world upside down.  He finds out he was adopted, and going to Alaska he will learn about his true birth mother, but he also finds out about his birth father.  Ted finds out he inherits some snow race dogs, which he is not thrilled with.  Ted HATES dogs with a passion.  Well it turns out the dogs don't like him much either, and that's when the fun really begins!    As anxious as he is to return to Miami, he finds himself starting to appreciate the low key town, but he is especially drawn to Barb (Joanna Balcaso - My Baby Daddy).  Ted wants to prove he hang so he tries to learn the sport, and again you get a ton of laughs as he tries to control the dogs.  I'm not a dog lover, but even I could not help but fall in love with the canine stars in this film.  Especially Demon and Nana.  The dream sequence is quite enjoyable.  James Coburn is wonderful as Thunder Jack the "father", and he keeps harassing Ted into giving him the dogs.  Nichelle Nicholos was simply GORGEOUS in this film.  Just stunning!!!    Some of the funnier moments in the film:  1.  Teds first encounter with the dogs will leave you in tears because you will be laughing so hard.   2.  Ted trying to get the dogs to Mush, and the dogs taking him on a wild, wild ride.   Please ignore the reviews that trash this film.  This is a film that will leave you with that feel good feeling when it's all over!!  This is a film for the whole family to sit down together and enjoy. I enjoyed this movie so much, I plan to add it to my collection.  My niece would love this film.
