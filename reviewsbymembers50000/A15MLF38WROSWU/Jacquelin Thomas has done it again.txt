 Jacquelin Thomas is one of my favorite Arabesque authors.  Dr. Ashford thinks Marc Chandler is responsible for the death of her mother and is willing to risk her career to avenge her mothers death.  It's a nicely woven story of betrayal and hidden family secrets that reveal the truth.  Wonderful read.
