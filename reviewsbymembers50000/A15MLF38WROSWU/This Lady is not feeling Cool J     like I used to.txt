 LL has managed to do what others wish they could do.  Survive in this fickle industry for over 20 years!!!  I've been following his career since he dropped his first album Radio, and I've been an LL fan ever since.  I've listened to this album over, and over again, and I have to say I'm disappointed.  Definition has a few songs that are good, and to me the rest are filler tracks that will get skipped.  With all the boasting LL does, I had major expectations for this to be a good album, and when the single Headsprung was released I was pretty excited.  Even having R. Kelly(with some seriously off key singing!!! ) on a song will not save LL this time!!!  I've been an LL fan for years, and I was not expecting him to sound like he did when he released Radio or Mama Said Knock you out.  Artists are supposed to evolve and grow, but I just feel LL put an album out so he would stay on the mind of people, and the quality of this album is not on the level of what he has put out in the past.  Definition is just okay, and LL may find himself with some new fans, but his true fans (like me) will not be too pleased with this album.  Being the diehard LL fan I am I'm not licking my lips at LL's latest release.  I can only give LL a rating of 3 for this release.   The cuts I like: 1. Headsprung 2. Rub My Back 4. Move  7. Shake It Baby 8. Can't Explain It- This is my third favorite cut.  This is his signature LL Love jam he puts on his albums.  I LOVE this song!!!! 10.  Apple Cobbler
