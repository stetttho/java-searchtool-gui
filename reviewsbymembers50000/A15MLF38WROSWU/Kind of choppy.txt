 I thought this book could have been put together better.  It's not terrible, but could have been a lot better.  Nia Sebastian is a workaholic.  She puts her all into her career and tries to put out of her mind the love she had for Brett Faulkner.  Brett Faulkner enters her life after five years going by.  Brett unexpectanlty rekindles the romance they once shared, but things are interrupted when Nia's mentor and close friend is suddenly murdered.  Again, it's an interesting book, but you will get lost if you don't pay attention.
