 That's the question I had to ask myself when I watched this movie.  How far are you willing to go to fight for something you truly believe in?  The topic of the movie is the death penalty.  Is it used unjustly, should here be a death penalty?  You have people who are for the death penalty, and people who are against it.  David Gale against the death penalty.  David Gale is accused of rape, and his world is turned upside down.  He is ultimately fired from his job, and he loses his family over this incident. He is very much against the death penalty and will go to great lengths to support his cause.  When Constance Harraway his death penalty partner, best friend and confidant is raped and murdered David Gale finds himself on death row.    He refuses to speak to anyone until 5 days before his execution, and then he will only speak to Bitsy Bloom.  Bitsy feels that he is supposed to be on death row, but as she finds clue that shows other wise she is in a race to find out what really happens so she can try and help prevent Gale from being executed.  The story is revealed through a series of flashbacks, which kept me very interested in how this would unfold.  This movie is truly deep!!!  Kevin Spacey is simply marvelous in the role of David Gayle.  I was really into all the twists and turns this movie takes you through.  You have to not just watch this movie, but really pay attention to this movie to the very end.  I really enjoyed this movie, and would watch it again.  I found this to be a riveting drama.
