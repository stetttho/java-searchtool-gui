 I've liked Changing Faces since their first CD was released.  Their effort was good, but did not get the promotion it needed to be successful.  They have a very nice collaberation with another favorite artist of mine, Dave Hollister that should have gotten some major radio play.   1.  Visit Me - produced by R. Kelly but got no radio exposure here in Atlanta. 2.  That other woman  4.  Ladies Man 5.  Baby u Ain't me 7.  Be a man 10. That Ain't Me 11.  Out of Sight - This song is GREAT!!!  12. I told you - Dave Hollister throws down on this cut!!! 15.  That other woman remix My final comment.  I know there is a deep connection with R&B and Hip Hop.  Sometimes a rap artist will mess up a song.  B.R.E.T.T did on song #8.  I liked the song until his part came on.  His part ruined the whole song.  Other than that, the CD is good.
