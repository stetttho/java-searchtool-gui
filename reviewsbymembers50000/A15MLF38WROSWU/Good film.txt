 This film was really good.  By the end of the movie, I did not condone what was done, but I understood.  How many of us know people who came back after fighting for their country, and they are working jobs that suck, and living a tough life.  That's pretty much the message I got from the film.  I watch this movie about once a month, I like it that much.  Chris Tucker had a role in this film that makes you stand up and take notice.  I would love to see him in more dramas in the future.  He could do the roles.
