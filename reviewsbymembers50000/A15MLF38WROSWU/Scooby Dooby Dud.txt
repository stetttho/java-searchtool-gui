 I did not enjoy Scooby Doo 2 the way I enjoyed the first Scooby Doo movie.  Scooby Doo 2 seemed thrown together.  Matthew Lillard is excellent as Shaggy.  He had the voice dead on, but Freddie Prinze Jr. was so dull as Fred the second go around.  I'm a huge fan of the cartoon, but this movie was a serious let down.  The second go around the gang is caught up in a situation where an evil villain is stealing costumes from a museum, and turning them into walking ghosts.  A news reporter is using these events to her advantage to turn the public against the Scooby-Doo gang.    As I said before Fred was dull, and he had this whole "I'm the reason the gang is successful attitude",  Daphane was determined to prove she is not just a pretty face, and during her fights scenes I could not help but think Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Velma was trying to become more girlie to attract someone.  Even the CGI for Scooby Doo was no good to me.  The disco dancing Scooby with the afro was so corny.  I enjoyed seeing some of the classic monster's from the cartoon come to life, that aspect was really nice.  That was not enough to save the movie.  Seth Green stars in the movie playing the museum curator that Velma has a crush on.  Shaggy and Scooby feel worthless to the group, and prove to the gang that they can contribute more then they have in the past.    Let's hope they don't make a #3.  If you are a fan of the cartoon, you may not enjoy the movie.  I would say to stick with the cartoon and don't bother with the movie.  Stick with the first movie.  That one at least will make you laugh and is more enjoyable.
