 Jacqueline Jakes has written a book full of Inspiration, Encouragement and Virtues.  If you are struggling with anything in your life, you may find something to sooth your soul in this book.  Anytime I need my spirits lifted, I read this book. You can revive your faith, understand and better cope with problems.  I keep this book near my bed with my other spiritual books and read it often.
