 This movie should have been called "Charlie's Angels: Full of cameo's". I actually spent more time trying to see if I could count the number of cameo's then paying attention to the film itself. The movie was way over the top. There were just too many things in the second film that seemed unbelievable, but maybe that was the point. It was a point I missed. Crispin Glover as the Thin Man in the second film. I did not understand why his character was in this film. Was I too believe that the angels could be 1. Flung through a window at high speed, 2. fall down some stairs at high speed. 3. pull a piece of glass out of her stomach fight the bad chick, then change and appear at a Hollywood screening unscathed? Some of the fighting scenes were cool, but the movie IMHO was not as good as the first one. Someone compared this movie to face off. I'm sorry the two movies do not even compare!!! Face Off is a much better film.
