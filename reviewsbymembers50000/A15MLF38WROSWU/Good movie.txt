 I know some people did not like this movie, but I loved it.  The film had me hating some characters and loving others.  Ice-T played his role well in this film.  The scene that still gets me to this day is when he gets Pookie from that crack house.  The other scene is when he is with the drug lord, and finds out HE is the man responsible for his mothers death.  That scene was deep.  The film has a good cast, Mario Van Peebles, Wesley Snipes, Bill Nunn, Allen Payne, Vanessa Williams, Micheal Michaels and some other folks.  The film really hipped you to how bad the drug scene is in the inner city.
