 If you are a fan of the show Nip Tuck, then you must have season 2 of this phenomenal show.  This is another reason why I'm such a huge fan of TV shows on DVD.  When you don't have expanded cable you can't see some of your favorite shows.  I don't have the FX channel, so I was so happy when season 2 of Nip/Tuck was released to DVD!!!    In season 2 you have Christian bonding with Wilbur that will eventually be snatched out of his life.  Gina is still her usual crazy self.  Julia is dealing with the guilt of who Matt's true father is, and her relationship with her mother.  Christian having to deal with an HIV scare.  Sean and Christian dealing with aging.  Sean and Julia's marriage coming apart at the seams.  Liz wants to have a child.  Matt finding out who his real father is.  Sean dealing with a shaky hand.  Ava the life coach who seems to need some coaching of her own!!!  Ava's messed up son.  Kimber Henry is back, and she still loves Christian despite how he treated her.  She has a doll made in her image, and wanted Sean to help her make it look authentic in a certain area.  Season 2 was good, and had plenty of drama for sure.  (...)
