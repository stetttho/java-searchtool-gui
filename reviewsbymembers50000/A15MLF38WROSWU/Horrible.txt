 I see I'm not alone with my review of this book.  If I could give this book 1/2 a star I would.  I usually like Shelby Lewis, but this book had to be her WORST.  The first chapter was the best chapter, after that it just confusing, and I had to FORCE myself to skim through this book searching for the decent parts.  The only reason I have this book is because I'm part of the book club.  After today it will become friends with the trash can.
