 I really enjoyed this movie.  This was such a sweet love story Nicole is in love with Robbie who is planning on a future without her.  She is distraught, and moves to another city to get a fresh start.  Her roommate Lisa informs her that she had to sublet the apartment, and her new roommate will be her ex's brother.  Nicole is not pleased, and begs her to tell Brian that he can't have the apartment.  Brian does not get the message, and he shows up at the apartment.  She tries to avoid him, but eventually she warms up to him.  There is an attraction, but she is really scared about allowing herself to be so vulnerable, but she can't deny the attraction.  They both have issues to resolve.  Her issue is dealing with her ex who is pursuing her now that she has left.  Her other issue is realizing that someone her ex told her was only a college friend is actually his ex fianc.  The movie has a GREAT cast.  The chemistry between Nicole and Brian was really great!!  Rockmond Dunbar has a part in this movie, but his part in the movie did not totally make sense to me.  I guess he was just the rebound guy, but that was never established.  The songs in the movie were really great also.  You will laugh, and there are scenes that really touch your hear.  I enjoyed this movie so much I plan to buy it.  If you are looking for a good love story with a great cast, then you have to see this movie!!!
