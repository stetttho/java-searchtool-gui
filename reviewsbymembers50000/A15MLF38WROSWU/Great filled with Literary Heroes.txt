 To truly appreciate this movie you had to have a love of literature.  This movies brings together some very unlikely  heroes to help save the world from a madman that is planning the destruction and take over of the world.  Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, Wilhelmina Harker, Dorian Gray, Tom Sawyer, and Dr. Jeckyll.  Connery is Quatermain.  The movie is really good, and it really surprised me.  You have the usual plot of who is trying to be a saboteur, who can you trust, tease of a past love affair, and some good action.  While this movie is not great, you get drawn in.  I was really enjoying the Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde character!!!  Watching him change, and this big monster actually be heroic!!  You will find yourself rooting for him big time.  I really enjoyed this picture.  I also enjoyed Mina's Vampire character.  She was so lady like, even after biting someone's neck!!!  Loved her!!!
