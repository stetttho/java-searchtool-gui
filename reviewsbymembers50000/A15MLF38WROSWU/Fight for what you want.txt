 This book was great.  It teaches the lesson of fighting for what you want.  It's a lovely story Davis Beriya trying to live a normal life before having to assume his royal position back home.  He falls in love with Abbie Barnes who ends up falling for him.  An enemy from his home places them both in danger and Abbie has to trust him if she expects her life to return to normal.  Her life will never be normal again after being with Davis.
