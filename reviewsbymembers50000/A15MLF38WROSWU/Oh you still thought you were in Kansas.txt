 You are not in the Land of Oz you are used to.  You won't find a cowardly lion, or a tin man here.  However, you will find plenty of folks with no heart!!!    Season 2 finds the smoke clearing from the aftermath of the prison riots that ended Season 1.  Tension is high, but what else can you expect from Oz?  Oz is trying to recover from the riots, and Oz is being threatened with being shut down.  2 officers are killed, 6 prisoners are dead and 34 wounded.  Governor Devlin gets Alvah Case (Charles S. Dutton) to investigate what happened to lead to the riot.  Of course when it's all said and done, he will find no one is to blame.  The Governor is not happy about that one bit.  He is not happy unless he can make heads roll.  Inmates are suffering from drug withdrawals.  The mole will try to dig his way out of Oz.  Wangler can't read, and he thrives on being ignorant.  He hides his shame of his illiteracy by being tough.  The drug war between the blacks and Italians reach a fever pitch, while the Arians attempt to regain their dominance in Oz.  Beecher is introduced to his new cell mate Chris Keller (Christopher Meloni) in a love hate relationship that will leave your head spinning.  Ryan O'Reilly's finds himself caring and protecting for his mentally ill brother Cyril.    McManus is hoping to make some changes to make Em City function better.  He creates 10 groups residing in Oz:  the Muslims, the gangsters, the Latinos, the Italians, the Irish, the Aryans, the Bikers, the Christians, the Gay, and Others. 4 members from each group will live in Oz, and one member of the 4 will represent it's respective group win weekly meetings so they can talk about what's going on in Oz.    Oz continues with intricate story lines that will shock and keep you riveted to the screen.  Ryan O'Rielly finds out he has breast cancer. As manipulative as he is, you find yourself feeling sorry for him, then he does something that will make you upset for feeling sorry for him.  Glynn's daughter is raped, and someone in Oz knows who committed the crime.  Glynn is determined to find out who did it.  There was one line that narrator Hill says that is funny.  Hill has a cell mate his having major flatulence issues and he says "Smelly farts are a sign of something seriously wrong on the inside."    Said is trying to help Hill get out of prison.  Poet Arnold Jackson gets his poetry published, and it can be his key to freedom.  Ryan hits on Gloria mistaking her care for his health for affection. This will continue a story line of obsession that is very creepy.   Shabetta and Adebesie can't stand one another.  Judge Grace Lima wanted to see Beecher, felt she gave him a bad sentence.  Keller is working with Schillinger being a spy, but he is developing real feelings for Beecher.  Female inmate Shirly Bellinger is an interesting character.  She is the only female inmate on death row at Oz.  She was sentenced to die for killing her daughter.  Arnold Jackson is granted parole, and vows he will not return to Oz.  He promises to make the most of his second chance.  It's later found out that Ryan had Cyril kill Gloria's husband, all in the name of love.  I felt the weakest Prisoner story line was Prisoner Jiggy Walker (LL Cool J).  Jiggy Walker links drugs to Governer Dublin, turns out he was lying.  His story line was a strange one being he only appeared on the show once.   Some guy gets into Adebesi's head.  Ribido has a grandson who has leukemia and his grandson wishes to go to Disney World.  The inmates come through and help Ribido to raise the funds for the trip.  Alvarez cuts out the eyes of a CO in a horrid and shocking scene.  Poet returns to Oz disappointing [black muslem guy]. Some of CO's in the prison are as criminal as the inmates, even more so.  Ryan is always being manipulative.  Something he does best.  He will only donate blood if his brother is released from solitary.  If you disliked Adebesi in season 1 you will really find yourself disliking him more in season 2!!!  His role is a lot more prominent.   Luis Guzman is Prisoner Raul Hernandez.  When Hernandez arrives Alverez finds himself on the outside looking in.  He is willing to do whatever it takes to impress Hernandez so he can belong.  Peter Schibetta enters Oz and his main mission is to find out who murdered his father Nino.  Needless to say, Peter and Adebesi will be at odds with each other.    One of the best performances to me is Beecher.  In season 1 he is a new prisoner, the lawyer who was sent to Oz for killing a young girl while under the influence of alcohol.  Season 2 you find Beecher much harder after having to deal with Vernon Schillinger.  He is sick and tired of being the victim and decides it's time to be the tormentor and sets about getting revenge against Schillinger anyway he can.  His wife dies, commits suicide leaving his children to be raised by his parents.  He is so despondent over her death, he starts drinking again.    The Characters I like:  Hill, Beecher, Said (love him!!!!), McManus, Rebadow,  Sister Pete, Dr. Nathan, Poet, Arif to name a few, Alvarez (you end up feeling sorry for him).  The Characters you will love to hate:  Schillinger, Adebisi, O'Reilly, Schibetta, Glynn (okay I'm on the fence, sometimes I love him, sometimes I hate him)  New Characters:  Jiggy Walker, Nappa, Keller, Hoyt, Cyril, Busmalis, El Cid, Shirley Bellinger, Guerra, Pancamo, Kirk, Coushaine.  I'm a fan of the show, so I enjoyed season 2 immensely.   If you own season 1, then season 2 is worth having.  To play the Deleted Scenes extras a play all feature would have been really nice. I also like how you get a quick recap of the previous show before watching the new episode.  This is an awesome drama.
