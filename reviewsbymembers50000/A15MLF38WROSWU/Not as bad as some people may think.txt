 I read the reviews about this book and braced myself for the worst.  I was all set to put my book up for sale, but I'm glad I'm able to form my own opinion.  I thought this book was pretty good.  The book is about three women, Lisa, Sundee and Danielle.  All of these women are in various stages of relationships and self discovery.  Sundee just married is dealing with having to share her life, but not lose herself in the process.  Lisa is looking for love, and thinks she finally finds it.  Danielle is a married woman who has an affair.  Basically they don't realize how good their life is until the bad times roll in.  It's a good read.
