 This is my favorite movie by Eddie.  Right after Coming to America.  I truly feel this movie brought out the foot fetish in a lot of men, and the reason so many women go have pedicures done!!!  Anyone who has seen this movie over and over again, know exactly what I'm talking about.  The reason I enjoy this film so much, his character is that player, that finally admits that he has found love.  It's a funny, sweet film.  Great cast in this film.  A must have for that DVD collection for sure.
