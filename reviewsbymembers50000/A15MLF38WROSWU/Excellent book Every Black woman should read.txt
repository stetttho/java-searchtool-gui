 I picked this book up after a friend suggested I read it. I read a chapter a day until I finished the book. Dr. Cornish compiled some things we as black women tend to do (she even admitted making some of the same bad choices) outlines the problems, and offers wonderful suggestion to help us STOP making the same bad choices. Bottom line is you have to be willing to hold yourself accountable and admit you are making these mistakes, and be willing to stop them. She will tug at your heart when she discusses the deaths of her mother and Aunt to men, and discusses how their bad choices played a role in their deaths. Six out of every black woman are either in bad relationships, share a man or choose to be celibate. Are you one of those six women? I also feel this book is not just for black women. I think any woman can read this book and find something in this book they can use to help them make wiser life choices.     In this book she will discuss:    1. Sisters Dissin Sisters ?   I wish every black woman would read this chapter!!! It's time for the madness to stop!!! We need to stop talking about each other, and really learn to love our fellow sisters.     2. No Money, No Honey  3. Exchanging Sexual dealings for loving  4. Looking for Mr. Right in the Wrong Places  5. Using your finance to maintain his romance  6. Staying on, although the respect is gone  7. Loving the "Married Bachelor"  8. Emotional dependency, plus unplanned pregnancy  9. decent proposal/Indecent disposal  10. Getting to the Church before time     One or more of these chapters will wake you up and make you take stock of your life. Take stock of the choices you have made, and hopefully you will make better choices in the future. This is an excellent book!!!
