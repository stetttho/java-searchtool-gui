 This was okay.  I felt Eddie Griffin would have been a lot funnier with less use of the N word.  That is utter nonsense what he said, "The more you say a word the less power it has".  He can believe that if he wants, but if someone non-black were to utter that word in his face, he would be upset just like many black people who use the word, and claim the same thing he does get.  When he said if Michael Jackson lightens himself one more time he will be clear I could not agree with him more!!  When he talked about the spankings he got from his mother I laughed so hard.  That is something just about anyone can relate to if you have a mother who won't take any mess.  "Pain will give you a memory of what not to do."  That is the truth.  Sometimes you need to spank.  There is a difference between abuse and spankings. Eddie is saying get tough on children because let's face it, sometimes time outs do not work.    Talking about his family, is when he is the most funniest.  You get to meet some of Eddie G's family during the DVD.  We get to see his mother, and two of his Uncles.  His Uncle Curtis wanting to be a porn star was funny.  His Uncle Buckey was an ex-con and recovering drug addict.  He talks about meeting his father for the first time as a teenager.  He talks about how one time his mother tried to run over him with her El Dorado.  Some of my favorite lines was when he said his mother "Beat him to a professor".  When he talks about Micheal Jackson looking like the female version of the Planet of the apes, I could not help but laugh.    Eddie uses some lots of vulgar language and if you are easily insulted by profanity and sexual content, this DVD is not for you.  I enjoyed watching this for certain parts because Eddie is talented. I just wish our black comics would stop using the N word.  It's not funny.
