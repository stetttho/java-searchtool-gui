 If this is in fact Aaron Hall's last CD, I'm very disappointed.  Aaron has a true singing voice, and is really an underrated artist.  He just never seemed to be very well marketed either.  I happen to find out he had an album coming out when I did a random search on the internet, and then saw the information on amazon.com.  Aaron's career should have been much better then it was.    His niche are his slow jams.  This man can simply sing the slow jams and you will find yourself hitting repeat on songs like Sorry, Still Here, All I Think About you.  If you are an Aaron fan then you must have this CD in your collection.  It is worth the money.  Lack of radio play may have also hurt his career as well, not to mention his personal issues.  When it comes to the up-tempo tracks I always felt he needed better production, if he had a stand out up-tempo track that could have garnered him some radio play, I'm sure that would have helped him tremendously.   I will admit when I saw some of the tracks had some hip hop artist I never heard of, I got very concerned.  On his second album he had this one track I was really getting into(track 6) and then the rapper came on and ruined the whole song for me.  Nothing worse, then a song being ruined by a horrible hip hop artist.  I will say KanasCali had a decent flow and the songs are simply okay.  I hope Aaron will reconsider and release one more album.
