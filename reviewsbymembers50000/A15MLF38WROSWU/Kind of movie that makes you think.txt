 This movie is real, because I know so many smart young women who make the mistake of getting pregnant and then trying to figure out what to do.  The choices this young lady made were heart wrentching.  It pretty much shows how one misguided choice can affect the rest of your life.  I think if you are a parent, you should watch this movie with your teenager, and have a serious talk about SEX....not the birds and the bees but SEX.
