 The book kept my interest.  It did not blow me away, but I would read the book again. The story is about Chico, Anastasia, Tomalis, and Diana in an office building.  Each character is going through something that could impact their careers and lives.   Out of all the characters the two I would love to see another book on would be Diana and Edmund.  Especially Edmund.  The story was cool though.
