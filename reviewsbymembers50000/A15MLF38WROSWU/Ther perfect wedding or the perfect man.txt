 This is not the most exciting book.  It did however; keep me interested to complete it.  You have to keep up because it does bounce back and forth to the present and past.  In the end it's a sweet story.  Does Missy give in and marry a man she knows she does not love, or will she smarten up and allow Jimmy to enter her life again.  If you manage to make it past the slow parts of the book, you will be in for a pleasant surprise.  It's because of how the book ended, it's staying in my collection.
