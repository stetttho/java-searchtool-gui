 I missed some episodes of Sex and Cities second season.  I spent at lot of time laughing, but some of what happened to Carrie I've had happen to me also.  The one scene I kept rewinding was the ending of the Tantric scene.  I just could not stop laughing!!!  These ladies had such wonderful chemisty.  I really enjoy this show, and look forward to buying the series because I know I will be watching this show for years to come.
