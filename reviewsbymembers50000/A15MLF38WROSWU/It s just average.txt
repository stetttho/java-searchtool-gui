 I expected something better from the group.  The album was okay.  I purchsed it (used thankfully from Amazon.com) because I really liked one song in particular.  The songs that were supposed to be upbeat could have been left off the album, and some of the other slower songs, left much to be desired.  Scola did add something to the Dru Hill harmony, but aside of that I was not all that impressed. The songs I enjoyed the most: 2.  Xstacy JOnes 3.  I should be 6.  On Me 8.  She said 9.  I do 10. I Love you - LOVE THIS SONG!!!!
