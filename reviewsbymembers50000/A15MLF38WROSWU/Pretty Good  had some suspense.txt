 A sister and brother are making a road trip home, and when they enter a small town, they get an adventure they did plan on.  They almost get run off the road by some psycho driving an ugly brown truck.  Then the brother decides they should investigate the psycho driver dumping bodies near an old church.  This will be one time they wished they minded their own business!!!    This movie was not fantastic, but it was decent enough to keep my attention.  I even jumped a few times watching this movie.  The only reason I'm giving this movie a 3 rating is I like it when a horror film gives you some background on why the monster exists.  We knew why Jason, Freddy, Micheal Myers, Chucky, etc were the monsters they were.  We knew why they killed.  With this creature all we knew is every 23rd spring, it would eat for 23 straight days.  We knew it choose it's victims by sniffing out their fear, and taking the parts it wanted.  We knew it could regenerate, and that's all.  I wanted to know where this creature came from, and why.  This movie left too many unanswered question, and trust me they won't be answered in the second movie Jeepers Creepers 2. Aside of that this film has the right amount of suspense, and gore to keep horror fans happy.  It's not worth buying, but it's worth renting.
