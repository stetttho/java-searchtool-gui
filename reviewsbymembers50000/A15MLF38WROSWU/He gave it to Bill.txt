 but the album left much to be desired.  I'm sorry.  I love Luda, but IMHO this is NOT his best album.  It seems like he just went into the studio, mad, and put down some tracks and said "this will be my album".  Some songs make you chuckle, but he does not have the production like he did with his previous releases.  He does not have that one cut on the album that will make you bob your head.  It's okay, but I won't be playing this CD too often.
