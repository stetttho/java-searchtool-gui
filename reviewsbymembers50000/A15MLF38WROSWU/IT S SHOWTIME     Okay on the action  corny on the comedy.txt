 I could not help but rent this. I?m a fan of both Eddie and De Niro, and I was curious to see how their chemistry was in the film. Mitch and Trey are two cops who end up being paired together for a reality show that is called Showtime. Mitch hates the idea and does not want to do it, and Trey find this to be a great opportunity to become a star. Now at the same time he is also planning to take the detectives exam, and would love for Mitch to kind of mentor him being that he failed the exam two times already. Rene Russo is that hungry TV executive that will stop at nothing to get the footage for the show, and to make it a ratings success. Trey wants to bond with Mitch, but Mitch just wants to be a cop. There are some decent action scenes. The problem I had with this movie is the movie seems to weight heaver on the action, and totally loses the comedic aspect. William Shatner totally stole the movie even though his role was a very small one.     Kadeem Hardison had a small role that was totally wasted in this film. This is the kind of movie you watch once, and be done with it.
