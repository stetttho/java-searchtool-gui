 I read this book in one day.  It was such a wonderful book.  It had a nice mixture of romance, with mystery.  Shari Jarrod tries to avoid love at all cost.  Emmanuel Jones is a playa trying to change his ways.  A chance auction pairs the two on a date.  Emmanuel falls for Shari, but they both try hard to keep each other at arms distance.  In the end Emmanuel relizes how empty his life will be without Shari in it.  Maybe in the next book we will be invited to the wedding?  Fantastic book.  Candice is one of my favorite author's and once again she did not disappoint.
