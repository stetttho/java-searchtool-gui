 This is another selection I was able to borrow from the library.  It was on the shelf, and I was curious.  Okay granted the movie is not academy award winning, but there were some pretty decent scenes.  Anne Marie is a competitive surf boarder who is trying to get over a near drowning.  She is trying to move forward, but this near drowning keeps holding her back.  In addition to that she is trying to make ends meet working in hotel and is taking care of her younger sister.  The of course is not without it's club scene, and some drinking is involved, but it's not overboard. It fits the story line.  There is also a nice little love story.  I could have done without seeing the big guy in swimming bikini like trunks (shudders at the memory).  You will get caught up in the excitement of the surfing competition on Oahu's Bonzai Pipeline.  The cinematography during those scenes was spectacular.  The movie is okay, but the surfing scenes are the most exciting part of the movie for sure.  It made me want to actually learn how to surf, being a thrill seeker.  Surfing does look like fun.
