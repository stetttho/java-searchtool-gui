 I popped this in my player when this first came out, and it still gets much play!!!  This artist has a strong voice.  Where is she now?  Hold On is my jam!!!  When I'm going through something deep, I play this song.  Symptoms of a Heartbreak is a song I played after breaking up with someone.  This album was slept on IMHO.
