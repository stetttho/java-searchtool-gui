 I enjoyed hearing I-20 on Luda's cut Move B.  I'm a sucker for deep voices. I-20's first solo effort is just mediocre.  Considering he had Luda behind him I guess I was expecting the album to be a lot better.  There are some good songs on the CD I do enjoy.  I usually skip the skits, but there is a Phone skit was pretty funny.  Fighting in the club has a tight beat and everyone delivers on this cut.  Break Bread is one of those songs I put on repeat and simply jam to it.  Kisha is a deep song about a teenage girl growing up in the hood. OG Anthem has a nice little groove to bob your head too.  I wanted to know who the person was singing on a couple of his cuts.  She has a nice voice. Then there are some songs that are a waste of CD space, like Hennessey and Hydro, So Decatur, and Hey Shawty. I just have to know how many songs can be created about drinking.  Guess you have to be a drinker to really appreciate those types of songs.  The album is simply okay.     Favorite Cuts: 3.  Fighting in the Club 6.  Break Bread 7.  May Sound Crazy 9.
