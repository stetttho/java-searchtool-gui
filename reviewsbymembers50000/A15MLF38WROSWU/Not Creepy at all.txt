 Jeepers Creepers 2 was not good at all.  The first movie at least scared me, and was full of suspense.  This movie did not scare me at all.  The Creeper is back, but this time instead of using that beat up old truck to terrorize his victims, he is flying a lot more in this movie.  A school bus on it's way back from a game is stranded on the road with a flat tire. Upon further inspection, it's realized that the flat tire may not be an accident.  As the adults are the first victim of the Creeper, the kids find they have to fend for themselves.   The scenes that were shocking in JC2 would end too quickly because I would find myself laughing next.  The scene that made me laugh the most is when the creeper is making his faces as he picks out his victims.  He is winking, and giving thumbs up, then I remembered, I'm watching a horror flick, not a comedy!  If horror movies make me laugh, it's a flop in my opinion.  If I want to laugh, I will rent a comedy.  There were scenes where the Derry from the first movie is giving Minxy background information she needs to know about the creature.  The main problem I had is you don't learn anything new.  He comes every 23 years, and for 23 days it feeds.  I still don't know where this creature comes from, and why?  Still too many unanswered questions about the Creeper which leaves me dissatisfied.  This is one movie I won't be watching again.  I really hope they don't release a three, but the way JC2 ended, there just might be a third installment.    This movie is not scary, and it's not worth buying.
