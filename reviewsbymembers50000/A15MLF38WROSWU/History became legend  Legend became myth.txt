 There is no need for me to rehash the story line.  Judging from the number of reviews I'm probably the last person to even see this movie.  I never read the book, so I was not sure if I would be able to follow the film.  After hearing so many people talk about the film I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  I was very surprised at how much I really enjoyed this film.  You really get sucked into the story.  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next.  I laughed when the mischievous hobbits were made to wash dirty dishes for their prank with the fireworks.  You have various characters, the bad guy trying to do evil, the good guys willing to sacrifice their lives to save their world.  Different types of wonderful monsters, how can anyone not enjoy this film?    When Gandorf stood up to that monster I just knew he was a goner. The characters could not let their guard down in this film could prove detrimental.  The characters in the film never knew when the enemy would strike and they had to stay prepared at all times.  Amazing how one little ring can cause such a major ruckus!!!  This movie is the type of film you can find your self watching over and over again and see something new each time.  This is an excellent, excellent film that is well deserving of the hype it received!!!
