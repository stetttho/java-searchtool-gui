 Nicholas Champagne met his match and Amanda is all the woman he can handle!!!  I enjoyed this book so much.  It was nice to revisit the Champagne family, and I'm so happy that Sheila could not get her claws into Nicholas.  Finding out that Janet and Summer are sisters was no huge surprise.   Great, great read.
