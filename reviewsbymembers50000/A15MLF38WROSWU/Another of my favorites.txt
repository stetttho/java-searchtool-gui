 Keenan plays a down and out PI named Shame, with his wanna be PI Assistant Peaches (played by Jada Pinkett).  Shame finds out the love of his life is back in town and does what he can to save her.  Peaches wants Shame to notice her, and does everything to get him to do so.  The movie is fun, filled with action, and will have you laughing in some parts.  I Love this movie!!!
