 If you are looking for a movie that has some decent action scenes, then this is your movie.  The Transporter does not have a deep plot, or fantastic acting.  It does have some decent fight and actions scenes, and will keep your interest.  Frank Martin is a Transporter.  He will transport dangerous or illegal goods no questions asked.  Just follow the rules, and don?t veer from the plan.  When Frank realizes one of the packages he is to transport is a beautiful woman, he realizes he may have gotten into something he wishes he kept his nose out of.  The car chase scene is great!!!  Very quick paced, and you will want to watch it again, because some of the stunts are pretty nice.  The one scene that I found to be original was the fight scene where he has some motor oil all over himself.  Now that is something I?ve never seen before!!!  Aside of that some of the plot seemed recycled.  The slavery trade reminds me of Lethal Weapon 4.  Like I said the fight scenes are pretty good, but aside of that the movie is just average.
