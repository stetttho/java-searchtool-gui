 This film is good!!!!  4 ladies finally have enough of the tough life, and come up with a sceme to rob banks so they can get out of the hood.  All I have to say is surpurb acting!!!  Especially by Queen Latifah.  She was just convincing as the lesbian tough gal.  All the women in this film were great, and the movie was a good, good film.
