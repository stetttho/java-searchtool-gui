 Okay I admit it.  At first I did not think Beyonce was all that great a singer when she was with Destiny Child.  Her debut album really surprised me.  I had no plans to purchase the album, but after she performed Dangerously In Love on the grammies I had to have the album.   My favorite songs on her album are: Crazy in Love Naughty Girl Baby Boy Me, Myself and I Signs Dangerously In Love The album is not bad at all.
