 I belong to Crunch Fitness and there is this great instructor named Mike at the Parkway Point location who plays DD as one of the songs we spin to.  This song stuck in my head, but I did not know who the artist was.  I LOVE THIS SONG, and will be buying the CD.  A friend of mine has the CD and I played it and loved every song.
