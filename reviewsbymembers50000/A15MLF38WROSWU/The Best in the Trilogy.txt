 This is the best in the trilogy, and I can't wait to watch this movie again!!!  It was simply fantastic.  The opening of the movie with the history of Gollum was tremendous!!  What I really enjoyed about this movie is the movie was more than an adventure film.  The story had romance, dealing with friendships, loyalty, and most of all courage.  The courage to see something through to the very end. To fight for what you believed in.  You can't exclude unity.  To see all the different characters unite for one purpose was just wonderful.  I had to rewind during the battles in the film because they were just so jaw dropping.  I loved every single one of them.  The third installment of LOTR is an edge of your seat white knuckled action fest that will leave you screaming and clapping.  Aragorn becomes the King he was meant to be and those battle scenes!!  Oh wow!!!  Flying dragons, ghosts, catapults and these humungous mammoths, I can't say anything but oh wow!!!  Good and evil have one last show down and the show down is awesome.   To truly understand what all the fuss is about you have to watch this movie and then you will understand.  So many times movies are over hyped and when you finally get to see for yourself you are left wanting more.  Then only thing you will want to do after seeing this third installment is watching it again, and again, and again.  The ending left me in tears; it was such a touching scene.    This movie deserved each and every Oscar it received.  It will be a long time before we see a movie trilogy such as this cause such fervor as the LOTR trilogy did.
