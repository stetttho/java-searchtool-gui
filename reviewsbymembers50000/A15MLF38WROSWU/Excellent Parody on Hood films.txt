 The Wayans have done it again.  Keenan screaming "message" in certain parts of the film was too funny.  A lot of what was spoofed will keep you laughing.  There is this one scene that Marlon Wayans is in that will have you laughing so hard, you will have to pause the DVD so you can recover.  I've seen this movie about 100 times, and STILL laugh at that one scene like I've seen it for the first time.  It's a funny film indeed.
