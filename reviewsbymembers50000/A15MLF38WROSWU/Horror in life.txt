 When I first heard about this movie, I was wondering about the concept of the film.  When I saw this in theaters, I came away very, very pleased.  This was a different take on the horror genre.  I saw it as the Horror of living life!!!  The stories were thought provoking, but Clarence Williams IMHO stole the movie with his "the stuff"!!!  The movie will make you think.  Think about your life, and how to change it if you are doing wrong, or being wronged.   A must have in your DVD collection!!!
