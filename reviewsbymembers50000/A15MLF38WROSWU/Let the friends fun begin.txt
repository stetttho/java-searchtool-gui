 I'm going to be honest. I did not start watching Friends until the 4th season.  I kept hearing people talk about the show and I got curious and decided to catch a few episodes.  When the show came on in syndication I tried to catch the shows I missed.  Which is why I'm excited the show is on DVD as full season sets.  I keep seeing people post that it's a waste of money to buy a show on DVD that you can see on TV in syndication.  I thought so too at first, but when you end up seeing the same episodes in syndication over, and over, you begin to miss episodes that are not shown on television.  Having the show on DVD means I can see certain episodes when I want, and see them COMMERICAL FREE.  Rachel, Monica, Joey, Chandler, Phoebe and Ross will be allowed into our living rooms for the rest of our lives.  It's fun to watch the series from the beginning, and watch how the characters evolve, and their styles change.  Ross spent season 1 being depressed about his wife being a lesbian, and facing the facts he would share parenting roles with the ex and the lover.  You watch the show, and you laugh more and more with each episode.  My SUPER favorites episodes are(because I enjoy all of them): 1. The one with the East German Laundry Detergent 2. The one with the boobies 3. The one with the fake monica 4. The one with two parts 5. The one with the poker 6. The one with the birth - no matter how many times I see this episode I always cry at the end.  I gave season 1 a 4 because as it good as season 1 is, it just gets better as the seasons go on.  This show is a lot of fun, and I hope to eventually own all the seasons on DVD.
