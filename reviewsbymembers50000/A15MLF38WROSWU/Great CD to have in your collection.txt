 Big Bub can SANG!!!!  His voice just grabs you and won't let go. He was the stand out voice when he performed with his former group Today.   I love playing this album, and it's in heavy rotation in my car and at home.  He is at his best when he sings ballads.  A good album, and it's a shame his career did not go further.  If he released an album today, I would buy it.
