 This movie was okay.  The thing that made me watch the movie was I really wanted to see how it would end.  I found the movie to be nothing but one big confession in a phone booth.  You never understand how "The Caller" knows what he knows about his "victims", but at the same time you can't tear yourself away from the screen.  You wonder does the Stuart wish he had not picked up the phone, will he just say to heck with it and leave, can the cops do anything?  How is it the caller can get in the head of Stuart the way he does.  It's an interesting suspense thriller.
