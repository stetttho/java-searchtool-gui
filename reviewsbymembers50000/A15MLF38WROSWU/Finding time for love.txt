 I enjoyed this book because it wove into the story line being a Big Sister which is a volunteer organization I hope to get involved in.  Casey James is a social worker who is very serious about her job.  She finds herself attracted to Alfred Willingham who is a very successful buy man.  Alfred is willing to try to make room in his schedule for a woman he falls in love with and his daughter.   He has to prove he can put his family before his business.  Not always easy to do.
