 I started watching this DVD with some hesitation.  I had seen another comedy DVD that was not all that good, and was hoping this one would be funny.  I enjoyed watching it, and I laughed, and laughed a lot.  The brothers discussed just about everything.  They tease each other, discuss celebrities, politics, Guy talks about Chinese people, the taking over of sports except hockey, and he discussed how he is always mixed up with his brother.  Joe Torry talks about being married, and having children.  He talks about the female anatomy, getting drunk, sex, and drinking too much.  These brothers were funny, and I really enjoyed this DVD.  They cuss, but to me it was not excessive.  The extras were nice to watch also.  They are shown with their family, and you get to see them as men, and not just comedians.  If you watch this DVD you will not be disappointed.
