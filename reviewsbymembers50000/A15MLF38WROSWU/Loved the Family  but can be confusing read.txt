 I normally can't get into Gwynne Forster.  This book kept my attention.  I fell in love with Tara.  Tara shows that children know when you truly love them.  She did not feel that with Jack, but always felt it with Telford.  Henry was tough around the edges, but you knew he was a teddy bear inside.  Towards the end, I was wondering if Alexsis and Telford would ever get their act together.  It's an okay read, if you can keep up with the ever skipping plot.
