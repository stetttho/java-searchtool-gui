 I got so sick and tired of hearing her say "I'm such a F'ng lady."  Hearing that the first couple of times was okay, but she would keep saying it and it got old real fast.  The sound on the DVD was not good.  The sound seemed like this was recorded using a tape recorder.  I had to really turn the volume up on my TV to hear her routine.  I did not really start to laugh a lot until the end of her set.  The last 20 min, was when she started getting really comical.  She talks about being upset the sniper was a Blackman.  She calls herself a COP = Citizen on Patrol (I found that worth a few chuckles).  She discusses current events such as terrorism, not being afraid to fly after 9/11, her relationship with her grandmother, and motherhood.  She has Rules for her money (again I kind of chuckled).    The topic I did enjoy hearing her talk about was Out of Control Kids.  That part of her routine was entertaining.  I also enjoyed her Celebrities as criminals routine.  She talked about Randy Mos, Dionne Warrick, and Jason Williams, and how they are people with so much money, but doing stupid things to have them end up in the jail.  Of course no female comic routine would be complete without discussions about the opposite sex.  The extras were pretty nice.  She read two of her poems that she wrote, and they were really nice.  One was titled "This is how I talk."  I revised my rating from a 2 to a 3.  I revised my rating after one of my friends rented the DVD and I had not choice but to watch it while at a party.  I still don't see myself wanting to buy or renting this myself again.  It was okay, but still not as funny as it could have been.    So my rating is now a 3.
