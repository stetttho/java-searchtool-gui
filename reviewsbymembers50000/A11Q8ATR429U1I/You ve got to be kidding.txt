 Avant Garde!  Sound Art!  Give me a break!!!!  This thing is complete, intolerable garbage!  I have very eclectic musical tastes, and listen to most anything, but this crap is absolutely painful to listen to.  And maybe that's the whole point.  It is an outpouring of emotion and pain that followed Yoko's tragic miscarriage, but to actually put this on CD and have people buy it, is a joke.  The opening track, "Cambridge 1969" is a 26 minute piece of intolerable pain, which features Yoko's offkey screaming, accompanied by John trying to match the pitch of her screams with feedback from his guitar.  If you can last the entire 26 minutes on this one, without going into a fit of rage and breaking something, you are a stronger person than I.  Let's face it---the only reason Yoko ever sold anything was because of her association with John Lennon.  This is awful stuff.
