 I have read some reviews of this CD that just rip it to shreds.  I don't undersatnd it.  Find me another band that can get together after 37 years and sound this tight.  These guys are incredible musicians, and we should be very thankful for this great "live" reunion CD, after all this time.  Quite frankly, I find it incredible, considering how long it has been since they all performed together.  Let's give them their due---5 stars from this old rocker.
