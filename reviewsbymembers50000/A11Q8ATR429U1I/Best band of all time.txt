 You can have your Led Zeppelins, Beatles, Rolling Stones and all the other so-called super groups!!!!  For my money, it's The Archies!!!!  Jughead's use of the high hat on "Sugar, Sugar", destroys anything John Bonham ever did.  In fact, few people know that it was Jughead who actually taught Bonham how to play.  Reggie lays down a bass line on "Jingle Jangle" that puts anything John Entwhistle did to shame.  And the depth of the lyrics on all of these tunes, makes what Lennon and McCartney wrote seem trite and unimportant.  The Archies had it all.  As if the stellar musicianship wasn't enough, they also played to our sexual sensibilities.  Watching Veronica shake that tambourine is enough to drive any red blooded American male absolutely wild!!!  And Betty shaking that blonde hair---well, they WERE rock in the late 60's/early 70's!!!  And Archie!!!!  I mean what can you say about Archie?!?!?  Jagger with red hair.  The sheer passion he pours in to "Sugar, Sugar" makes the Stones "Gimme Shelter" sound like "Mary Had A Little Lamb".  He is so missed by the rock world, who still mourn his untimely death from choking on a wad of Bazooka in 1983.  If you own only 1 CD this needs to be the one.  The Archies are what rock and roll is all about!!!!
