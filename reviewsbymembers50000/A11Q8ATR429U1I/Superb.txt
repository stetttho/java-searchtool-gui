 Not sure I would refer to this as the "best 'live' album ever", but I sure wish Ian would do a remaster on this one, and make it more available.  This is far better than "Bursting Out" or "Live at Hammersmith".  Definitely the best "live" TULL CD ever.    Traffic still does a much better version of "John Barleycorn" but all other cuts are top notch and have the boys in fine form.  Ahhhhh---when will we ever get a new Tull studio album.  Based on the excellent recent solo releaes by both Ian and Martin, we shouldn't hold our breath.  If you really enjoy Tull's music, you definitely need to pick up "A Little Light Music".  You won't regret it.  Since when have the critics been right about Tull anyway?  Listen to what their fans say about this release!
