 This is just a great, great CD.  I find myself listening to this one, probably more than any other CD I own---and I own a lot.  Only one negative thing I can say about this CD is that "I'm Gonna Make You Love Me" sounds EXACTLY like Fleetwood Mac.  Not that there is necessarily anything wrong with that!!!!
