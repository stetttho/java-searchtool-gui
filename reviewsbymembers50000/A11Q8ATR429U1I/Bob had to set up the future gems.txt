 I hate to read reviews that rip on this album.  Peronally, while I agree that it is not Bob's best, I do always enjoy throwin' this one on.  It is amazing to listen to this, and hear the shades of "Blood On The Tracks" and "Time Out Of Mind" that were yet to come.  Dylan was hanging out in Woodstock when this one was released, and was very happy with the domestic life.  Musically, I think this is a great release.  "If Dog Runs Free" is one of Dylan's most unique songs, and the pure jazz musicianship on the tune, with the great backing vocals from Maretha Stewart and the piano from the legendary Al Kooper, are excellent.  Kooper never came close to getting the credit he deserved.  His piano on the tune kicks about any jazz pianist I've ever heard.  All in all, this is a solid release from a legend.  If you are a true Dylan fan, you can't leave this one out.
