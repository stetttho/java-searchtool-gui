 I've been a big Tull fan since 1968, and have seen them "live" 11 times over the years.  I don't quite have all their releases yet, but I'm working on it, and am only missing a few.  That being said, and being the Tull afficianado that I am, I have to say, this is one of the best releases of their later period.  Granted, this is not up there with "Aqualung" or "Thick As A Brick", but this is a commendable CD, containing some great Tull tracks.  "Rocks on The Road" ranks among my top 5 or 6 Tull tunes ever, and "Roll Yer Own" is also a great song.  I think Ian's songwriting on "Catfish Rising" is still top-notch.  Not the best Tull CD, but one definitely worth having.
