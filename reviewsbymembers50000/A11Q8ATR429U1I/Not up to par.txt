 Well...  For what it's worth, I classify Tull releases into 3 categories---Classic, Good, and Not Up To Par.  "Rock Island" would fall in to the "Not Up To Par" category.  The only memorable songs here are "Kissing Willie", a tongue in cheek (or is it a willie in cheek?) look at oral sex, by the always amusing Ian Anderson, and "Another Christmas Song"---not as good as the original "Christmas Song", but still good.  I find the rest of the songs quite forgettable.  Still, not a horrible album.  However, when you have released classics lile "Aqualung" and "Thick As A Brick", that still send chills up my spine over thirty years after their release, "Rock Island" is quite a disappointment.  Those who feel this is one of their better releases, must not be familiar with what they accomplished on some of their other releases.
