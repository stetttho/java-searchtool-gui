 Great debut album.  While Bad Company was far from the best band of the 70's, I will say this...Paul Rodgers is one of the 4 best rock vocalists EVER, along with Robert Plant, Roger Daltrey, and Freddie Mercury.  It's just too bad that Rodgers fronted a band with only average musicians.  But when it comes to classic rock vocalists, Rodgers was one of the best.  I do have to agree with the one reviewer's comment that Bad Company was nothing more than a good garage band.  But man, what a lead singer.
