 Well, at age 48, I must say that I am not one who often finds new and fresh music that excites me.  This CD by Magnolia Electric Co, does.  I happened on these guys kind of by mistake---heard "Dark Don't Hide It" on the radio, and it blew me away, so I HAD to have the "Trails and Errors" release.  Received it about a week ago, and it has never left the CD player.  There will be inevitable comparisons to Neil Young, which i am sure the band would consider to be a compliment.  I read a review that said "Trials and Errors" is actually an existential response to Young's "Tonight's The Night".  When I read that, I thought the reviewer was nuts.  So, I did what any good rocker would do---I pulled out my copy of "Tonight's The Night" and put it in the CD player, to be followed by "Trials and Errors".  The musical experience was incredible.  I would heartily recommend it to anyone.  I don't care if you're 25 or 55, this is one of the best musical experiences you will ever have.  These guys are phenomenal.
