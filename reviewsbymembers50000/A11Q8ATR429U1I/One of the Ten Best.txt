 It's too bad we have old one star Muhammad spouting forth his political garbage on this site. I'm surprised Amazon would print his incendiary banality. Oh well---we live in a democracy, so everyone is entitled to their opinion.  But I thought these reviews were about the music.  I am diametrically opposed to Bruce's political views too.  But daggone, "Born To Run" is one of the 10 best albums ever recorded.  And that's what this site is really all about.
