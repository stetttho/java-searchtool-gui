 OK.  I'll give it a generous 2 stars because musically, it's pretty good.  But the vocals?!?!  Oh my goodness---the vocals.  Worst I have EVER heard.  I could sing better.  To Steve Walsh I would like to say brother, when it gets this bad, do us all a favor and go get a job in the private sector.  At least they include "Dust In The Wind", and bring Kerry Livgren on stage to sing it.  Kerry sounds pretty good on it---except for the high notes.  Walsh introduces him as "an old friend".  That's a laugh.  Livgren was and always will be Kansas.  The band basically threw him out, due to "artistic differences".  Pretty sad when a guy's Christian influences in the music lead the band to pretty much boot him.  If you are going to get some Kansas CDs, get "Leftoverture" or "Point of Know Return".  However, if you want to spend $6.98 for a nice coaster, then I'd go with this one.   Oh yeah---did I mention how bad the vocals are on this?
