 Comparing this mediocre CD to anything The Who ever recorded is absolute rock and roll blasphemy.   Yes, I'll give the Furnaces 2 stars for their creativity, and there are some fine moments on the CD, but they are few and far between.  It should be a requirement that you have to take Ritalin before listening to this mess.  I like Frank Zappa's stuff, but the big difference between Zappa and the Furnaces is that Zappa was a musician and he actually had talent.  The joke behind this CD is that every time I began to enjoy something melodic or rhthymic, it would change.  It's like listening to the radio for an hour, and having the DJ cut off every song, when it is halfway through.  Very frustrating.  Perhaps I don't understand what Matt and Eleanor are trying to do here, but then again, maybe it's better that way.  I'm sure they are nice people.
