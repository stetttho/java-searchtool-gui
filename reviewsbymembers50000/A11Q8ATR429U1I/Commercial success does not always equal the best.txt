 OK.  I realize people will disagree with me on this, and that's fine.  I have worked as a DJ for 35 years now, listened to a lot of music, and hopefully formed a lot of opinions.  In my opion, "A New Life" is far and away the best release ever from The Marshall Tucker Band.  so this isn't the stuff you're used to hearing on the radio.  That doesn't mean it is not their best stuff.  This may just be the perfect Southern rock album.  Put this thing on, and believe me you are IN the Blue Ridge Mountains, just soakin' it up.    An incredible release.  A must for Tucker fans.
