 Regret is about growing up and doing less drugs, neither of which helped  New Order produce some of the best indie-pop-dance-rock tracks of the 80s  and 90s. After all, the outstanding guitar work on Brotherhood isn't  physically possible without speed. Nevertheless, Regret is classic New  Order. A skillful blend of rock and dance, thoughtful lyrics and Hookie's  outstanding bass work. Singer Bernard Sumner sounds, well, _relaxed_ and  almost grateful for the chance to 'fess up. It's not up there with the  classics, which is why I only give it four stars, but if you've never heard  New Order before, this would be an excellent place to start.
