 Life in Maremma chronicles the trials and tribulations of the authors decision, move to and life within Maremma (literally, "marsh) in Southern Tuscany. This slim volume is beautfully written in concise, witty prose. The authors make it easy to understand the local customs and people, and resist the urge to show off their knowledge of Italian admirably. The book is amusing in two ways: the comedy of their Maremma life and the wide camp streak that runs throughout the book. This endearing campiness boils to the surface in a couple of chapters of exstatic writing on interior decoration and a voyage of discovery into the world of fabrics that made me laugh out loud. A large part of what makes this book so good is its refreshing approach to the overheated genre of "Anglos Move To Europe And Renovate House With Colorful Locals And Great Food". While the authors clearly fell in love with Italy, their viewpoint is balanced and clear: they nail the good and the bad even-handedly. There is none of the cloying sentimentality or blind worship of their adopted country. The authors don't build up the inhabitants of Maremma to be superbeings with all the answers to the Anglo quest for improved quality of life -- there's no subtext of "if only everyone would live like this we'd solve world peace and hunger" Highly recommended, though a little short for a full-price hardback.
