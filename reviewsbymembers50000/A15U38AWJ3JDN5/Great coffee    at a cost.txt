 I've had my coffeemaker for over two years, and I can honestly say it makes the best coffee of any drip machine I have ever used. However, there are some drawbacks -- hence the 3 star rating. There are three pieces to the machine's working parts: the grinding bowl and attached filter basket, the grinding bowl cover, and the filter basket cover. You put the grinder/filter basket + filter in the machine, put beans in the bowl, put the lids on the bowl & filter basket. Put (filtered) water in the back of the machine, the carafe in the front, set the number of cups you'll be brewing, and push the button. If this sounds complicated, it really isn't once you get the hang of it. The machine ensures that the optimal amount of water flows over the grinds through the "number of cups" setting (the rest goes direcly into the carafe). This eliminates acidic bitterness in the resulting coffee. The downside is that those four components (filter, grinder / basket, and the two covers) have to be cleaned. Water that evaporates as part of the brewing process condenses inside the components so everything is wet afterwards. You need to take out all of those items and clean and dry them carefully -- the machine does not work well if any of them are wet. To give you an idea of what this means: it takes me 15 minutes to clean, dry & refill the machine and brew a full pot of coffee. Other problems: we broke the carafe lid pretty quickly. It's flimsy, so plan on buying a new carafe at some point. The machine will overflow unless the carafe lid is on properly. The hinge on the lid of the coffee maker also broke on one side. Aside from treating it carefully, this has not stopped the machine working (if you try to brew without the lid properly latched and all the components in their places, the machine beeps at you). After talking about all these problems, I have to say that the machine is redeemed substantially by the quality of the coffee it produces -- it's really great coffee!
