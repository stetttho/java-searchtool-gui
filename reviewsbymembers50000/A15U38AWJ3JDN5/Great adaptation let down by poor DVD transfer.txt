 It's hard to describe how perfect these adaptations are: Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie are flawless as suave manservant and feckless dandy, respectively. Well cast supporting actors, fantastic locations and a crackling script from Clive Exton. Pure brilliance. But... all of this is tarnished by a poor transfer to DVD. It looks like a cheap job done quickly, with noticeable blocking and grain -- especially in low contrast scenes. Sadly, the better the DVD and TV you have, the more obvious the poor quality of the transfer. With so many excellent film->DVD transfers it's hard to understand why the publisher did such a poor job. There's really no excuse for such shoddy work. It's a real shame -- save your pennies and get the VHS video -- the quality should be about the same.
