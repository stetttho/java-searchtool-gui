 I'm glad I bought the batteries and charger for two major reasons * The batteries are 1600mAh and therefore last longer than cheaper (but lower capacity) cells *  The charger runs on any voltage from 100-240V, so I can take it on overseas trips I use these batteries in an Olympus E-10 camera, and they last all day -- over 100 pictures in one case. The recharger works just fine in Europe and the US, and there is no difference in recharging time. Recharging takes a little over 3 hours from completely flat, and you can re-charge NiMH batteries from any state and not worry about memory effect (i.e. no need to completely discharge before recharging) All in all, a great package of charger + batteries with the flexibility to take off to anywhere and not worry about voltage converters etc. Highly recommended.
