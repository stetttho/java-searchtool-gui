 The only cookbook that I regularly use, which makes it the best I have ever purchased by a long way. "Minimalist at home" works because in the process of stripping dishes down to their essentials, Bittman can explain how the dish functions. By this, I mean that he explains the roles of the different ingredients, and why leaving one out doesn't work. Once you know the basic function of an ingredient in the context of that recipe (e.g. vinegar as acid to balance sweetness), his recommendations for substitutes now make sense. The result is a book that not only suits weekday cooking (because you can typically use what you have in the fridge), but also increases your confidence and flair as a cook. You build your confidence by successfully substituting ingredients, and coming up with your own ideas for enhancements to dishes. This is a cookbook where you learn structure and principles that can be applied to all cooking -- unlike most cookbooks where you must slavishly follow the ingredients and method without understanding why they work. A book that strips recipes to their essentials does rely more on the quality of the ingredients. The extra expense to buy good, flavorful free-range chicken, for example, rather than the cheaper-but-flavorless anaemic supermarket version really pays off. If you are not prepared to do this, you will not get as much out of the book. I have cooked a large number of the recipes from the book and only a couple were misses -- "Chicken with vinegar" was disappointing, for example. But friends who come round for dinner rave about dishes like "Chicken under a brick", which is fantastic as well as being quick and easy to make. I have bought copies of this book for friends who like to cook, and they love it too. You should buy it!
