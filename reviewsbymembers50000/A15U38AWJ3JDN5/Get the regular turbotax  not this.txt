 The name "Home and Business" is misleading. This product will *not* help you do any taxes for your business. It will help you print out W2s and other forms for any employees, but it won't help you complete a business tax return if you have a partnership, LLC or corporation. For that, you need the similarly-named TurboTax For Business. If you have a sole proprietorship, this product might be useful if you have lots of depreciation. However, all it will do is a 1040 for individuals. It does a good job of this, and it is more helpful than regular Turbotax in calculating depreciation et al. for Schedule C. But again, I stress: if you are not a sole proprietor, you likely will not need this. The remainder of the product is the same as TurboTax Deluxe for individuals.
