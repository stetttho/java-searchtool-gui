 Tanenbaum has overhauled his second edition to take into account the massive shift to Internetworks and the IP protocol. As usual, he does an excellent job of elucidating the subtleties of the technology while maintaining his witty style. The book's key strength is that it combines solid theoretical underpinnings and clear explanations with consideration of the non-technical aspects of networking. These include market acceptance (some wise words on why ISDN failed, for example), the politics of "standards" and day-to-day pragmatic "getting it done" issues.   Tanenbaum's broader consideration enables the book to avoid the trap of becoming an unworldly academic text. It gives "Computer Networks" its licence to function as an indispensable everyday working reference.   I work in the communications/networking industry and keep this book handy. I lend it to colleagues to photocopy the odd section, and they always end up buying their own copy. Enough said!   I gave this book a 9 for including some of the old and dying technologies that lack even instructional value, at the expense of newer technologies that are seeing wide deployment. Grist for the fourth edition, I guess :-)
