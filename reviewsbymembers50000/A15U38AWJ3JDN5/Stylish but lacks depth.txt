 Night Train begins like a police procedural but quickly lifts readers beyond the genre into an exploration of the moral territory of suicide. If you want something different from the run-of-the-mill blockbuster novel that provokes thought and can be read in one or two sittings, then Night Train is a good choice. Stylistically, the novel follows the spare police procedural style. The narrator, Mike, is cut from that cloth: a hard-boiled female officer back on the wagon, rolling towards retirement after one too many alcoholic wipe-outs. She is called in to investigate the apparent suicide of Colonel Tom's (the police commander's) daughter, ostensibly because Mike knows the "victim" and her father, but more because "Colonel Tom was down to his last marble" and Mike is the only straight shooter in the department. Such strong roots in the police procedural form are used to good effect to explore suicide from several angles by setting a framework for the examination -- also driving the pace and pulling the reader deeper into the novel. Ultimately, though, the tension and expectation that Amis builds is rather wasted on the weak ending. The book is a short read -- I finished it in under 4 hours on a cross-country flight -- leaving the reader hungering for a longer book more depth and a more satisfactory ending. In addition, the narrator's voice reads like a man's -- I'm not sure Amis is able to adequately imagine the female point of view. To summarise: intriguing because of its radically different approach to story telling, good pacing and style. Let down by its lack of depth and weak ending.
