 Unreal Tournament satisfies gamers who like to frag and not think too much. It's a different goal than Half-Life, but UT beats the pants off Quake 3 Arena, it's competition in this category. The addition of quality  bots to UT makes all of the difference. It's easy to design a bot that can  slaughter human players with ruthless digital efficiency, but that's no  fun. UT's bots have different play styles and they can automatically change  their skill level to match yours. In on-line games, this means that you can  play to your heart's content without hanging around waiting for other human  players to join the server. UT looks great, and there are some terriffic  map designs, including a speeding train and an oil rig. Again, much better  map design than Quake 3. On-line play is easy to join, but modem players  are at a disadvantage on-line. You have to "lead" with your gun  to compensate for lag, which makes simply running around an easy way for  DSL and cable modem players to avoid being killed. Also, there are some  maps that encourage all of the players to congregate in one large room with  rocket launchers, which unfairly favours higher bandwidth connections at  the expense of modem players. I love playing UT both in the missions with  bots, and on-line. It looks great, and the game is nicely balanced. It  loses one star for on-line modem play limitations.
