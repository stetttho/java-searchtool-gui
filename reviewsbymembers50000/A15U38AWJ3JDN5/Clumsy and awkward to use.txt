 .... Although shaped to match the E-10, this case makes it very difficult to use the camera spontaneously -- and for general travel and everyday photography, this is a serious drawback. I moved from a Minolta SLR to the E-10 -- the Minolta case is attached to the tripod screw of the camera body, so that you can quickly flip the main part of the case off and have it hang from the bottom of the camera -- i.e. out of the way. The E-10 has to be totally removed from the case before you can use it. If you try to keep it attached to the camera strap with the provided loop, it gets in the way. You can't use the camera with the entire case dangling from the rear left strap eyelet, obscuring both the viewfinder and LCD panel on the back, and making the camera hard to hold. So, it takes longer to get the E-10 out of its case, and after that you have to either put down the case, stuff it in a bag or find some other way to deal with it while you take your photos. In a recent trip to Tuscany I ended up leaving the case at home on most days, as the extra protection it offered meant plenty of candid shots that were missed -- and there's no point owning a camera if you don't take pictures.
