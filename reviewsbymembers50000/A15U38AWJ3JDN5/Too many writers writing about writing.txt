 What's good about this book: the ordinary, everyday people who aren't writers, journalists or who don't work in publishing. Hell, even Bill Gates fits into this category (though his entry is strangely mundane). Intensely enjoyable, harrowing, shocking, uplifting entries from all walks of life. I don't know where else you'd find this. Some serious, important writing in these entries. What's bad about this book: way too many entries from journalists, writers or those in publishing. It's inevitable that Slate staffers are going to know lots of these people, but the urge to indulge has not been curbed. Like so many  narcissistic TV shows that are about other TV shows, publishing or the media, this book has way too many writers writing about writing. Well, I have a news flash with story at 11: You're just not that interesting. Give me more of the New York public defender taking on the hopeless murder cases for the homeless; give me more of the school nurse's insight and wisdom glimpsed through the children she sees; give me more of the hilarious classified ad sales person. What I don't need is more of the self-regarding petulance of the author and literary editor whose story got rejected. By all means grab a copy of this at the airport and skip the boring entries -- exactly what I ended up doing during a 3 hour delay in Denver. Or head over to the Slate web site and pick the wheat from the chaff yourself. Not a bad book, but not what it claims to be either -- "the best" Slate diary entries.
