 I've read every Kathy Reichs novel, and enjoyed all of them -- except this one. Plot-wise, Tempe finds bones in frozen Montreal, can't get police to investigate, gets on the case herself, puts herself in danger, has on-again-off-again relationship & deals with emotional houseguest who mysteriously disappears...  All of this will be familiar to Reich's readership as it's the plot of Deja Dead -- with some of the good bits left out. Perhaps this book should have been called "Deja Lit" (read it before).  The plot is typically well executed, but not particularly so; even the technical forensic detail regarding new applications of carbon dating feels half-hearted and is not pivotal to the plot. I really got the feeling that Reichs is in a rut and just going through the motions.  It's not a bad book, but it is certainly not a good one either and there are better hardback novels on which to spend your money.
