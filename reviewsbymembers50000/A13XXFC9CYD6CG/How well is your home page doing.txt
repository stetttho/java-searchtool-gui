 "Linked" by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi should be read by all who would know how intricate systems like the World Wide Web are interconnected for several reasons. First, he writes well, developing in narrative form the emergence of his interest in the subject. This is unusual for a scientist. Second, he thoroughly understands his subject, as is often not the case for science writers. Finally, the author presents several quantitative ideas which the general reader will find useful.   The most important of the ideas he presents is the prevalence of "power-law distributions" of the interconnections in many linked systems that have grown naturally, including movies (by their actors), members of an audience (through auditory cues), social systems (family ties, school ties, friendships, etc.), biological organisms (biochemical signals), the brain (neural interconnections), the WWW (URL links), and so on.   A fascinating fact, which has been determined by those programs that crawl through the internet gathering data on linkage, is that the probability of a site (yours?) having k links is proportional to k raised to the minus 2.1 power. Thus if there are N links to your site, a bit of math shows that you are among the highest M sites, where M equals one over N raised to the 1.1 power. You can estimate N for your home page by picking a key phrase from it and looking on Google. Try it!  Alwyn Scott http://personal.riverusers.com/~rover/
