 Most popular books on scientific topics are by professional writers who know how to construct interesting narratives but don't really understand the science. Thus they are overly impressed by those whom they have recently interviewed, remaining ignorant of the broad picture and history of their subject. Seldom does one come across a well-written book for the general public by scientists, but "Celestial Encounters" is an exception to this general rule.   Both of the authors (Florin Diacu and Philip Holmes) are distinguished researchers in the area of nonlinear science and also fine writers. Thus the reader is ever in good hands as the technical parts of the book are not dumbed down; the more technical sections (which can be skipped in a first reading) are correctly and carefully written in simple English. Anyone reading through this book will come away with greater understanding of the famous N-body problem of celestial mechanics - including both the history and how it fits into the fabric of modern mathematics, particularly in connection with the development of nonlinear dynamics and the modern theory of chaos.  The historical perspectives presented are particularly vivid and informative. I don't know where one would find a more interesting and better informed discussion of the curious events surrounding the award of the 1889 mathematics prize by King Oscar II of Sweden to Henri Poincar
