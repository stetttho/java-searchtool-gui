 The author of this lovely book writes about an important scientific problem - recognition of the importance of the soliton concept - in ways that will be of interest to both novices to nonlinear theory and those who are familiar with the underlying ideas. The latter will find much of value in the careful historical discussions, which make it clear that solitary-wave theory has been of interest to many scientists for the past century and a half, and in the references to Soviet and Russian contributions, which have been substantial. For those who come new to this subject, the Dr. Filippov explains all of the key ideas in clear English, using simple physical examples and metaphors. This book should be on the shelves of all who would better understand the many roles that soliton theory now plays in optical communications, superconductive electronics, elementary-particle theory, solid-state physics, and - last but not least - hydrodynamics, where the original Great Wave of Translation - studied in the middle of the nineteenth century by John Scott Russell provides a clear model for the tsunami that has recently devastated the rim of the Indian Ocean.
