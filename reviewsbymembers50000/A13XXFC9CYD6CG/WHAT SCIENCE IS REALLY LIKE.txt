 This in an important book. Using a narrative style reminiscent of C.P. Snow, the author gives his readers an inside view of interdisciplinary science - how new ideas arise and are worked through, and of the curious tribalism of segments of the scientific community, leading to the NIH response (meaning "not invented here").  The subject is how odors are sensed by living organisms and the scientist is Luca Turin, an energetic cosmopolitan polymath with a deep knowledge of perfumery and a doctorate in physiology. Turin has mastered an impressive swath of knowledge from the fields of biology, chemistry and physics and to construct a novel theory of olfactory perception. The conventional explanation of this phenomenon has long been Shape - an odor molecule with a particular size and shape fits into (or not) an appropriately shaped socket on the receptor - but this explanation has several difficulties that have been ignored by the community of olfactory scientists. Turin's explanation is Vibration - the receptors use ``inelastic tunneling spectroscopy" to register the molecular vibrations of incoming molecules, and he has assembled an impressive amount of empirical evidence in support of this view.  That's part of the story and it is told well, but an equally interesting tale is of how badly this idea has been received by those scientists who have been studying olfactory perception for decades and have become wedded to Shape. With Vibration in hand, Turin is outside the tribe, and his attempts to promote the theory are unfairly impeded. As the author doesn't hesitate to name names, this part of the story will be of great interest both to historians of science and to those general readers who wish to know how science really works.
