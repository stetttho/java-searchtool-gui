 From an evaluation in the New York Review (15 December 2005), I bought a copy of this book and couldn't put it down - reading it in one gulp. Although not flashy, the narrative is well constructed, leading naturally from Captain Yee's early life, through his years at West Point and his idealistic effort to become a Muslim Chaplain in the US Army, to his shameful treatment by those senior officers in charge of his posting at the Guantanamo Gulag. Yee names many of those responsible; thus one can hope that these people will feel the effects of a public opprobrium that they so freely encouraged.  As the related case of Dr. Wen Ho Lee at the Los Alamos National Laboratory has shown, this sort of problem is not restricted to one of the two major political parties. Rather, it stems from a fell mixture of the ignorance of security officials, the irresponsibility of senior officers, and the deep-seated racial and religious prejudices that have been part of our American culture since the Salem Trials of 1692.
