 something interesting about this album ( something jack has said ) is that they borrowed a lot of ideas from a tribe called quests "low end theory". when you listen to this album, i definitely does not soud like a hip hop lp, but you can see the influence.      i really love this guys music, so my review is going to subjective, but jack is a great musician. every one of his songs is the real deal, an uncompromised work of art. jack is technically not the greatest guitar player ever, is no the best singer, does not make extrememely "clever" arrangements, but his whole album, i repeat, his whole album, bleeds with soul.  this is the special kind of music that is made without pretense, without hidden motives, and seemingly without much effort. jack says that if his music career phases out, that he will just keep making music for his friends, like he originally intended. i was at a concert of his back in l.a. last year, and i kid yelled out from the front row, "be my friend jack! " man, he just smiled while still playing his guitar, stopped singing, and said," you dont have to ask, i already am."
