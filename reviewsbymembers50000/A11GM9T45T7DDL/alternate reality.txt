 it seems like the reviewers of this movie feel like they are owed an enlightenment for their 6 dollars and 2 hours of their life. pander to me! entertain me! enlighten me! this and that and this was wrong! too little talking! too much talking!  a shame, i could do better!       oh, how easy it is to complain. it is incredible how many people trash this movie! you know, there are over 2 billion people in the world that dont know what this movie is, and just want to have some food to eat. maybe next time you should take your 6 dollars and help save a child in a third world country who doesnt give a f_ck about how a multi million dollar special effects extravaganza that did not meet their expectations. perhaps this does not apply to you, but this is where it stands. we are a bunch of whiny spoiled brats.
