 first, a note on ken binmore: he was involved in the model of a worldwide auction that did very well. subsequently, he has become very rich and probably will not write another edition of this book. his model was based on game theoretic concepts.  this book has a few features that i think everyone interested in it should know about. 1. this is not at all a mathematically rigorous treatment of game theory. the proofs are few and far between and leave something to be desired. e.g. the famous "minimax" theorem. 2. this book was given as a text for my undergraduate game theory class. there are some interesting problems, but many may be considered too easy for students of mathematics. 3. if you are a student of math, you should try the higher numbered problems for more of a challenge. 4. the author does not cover games of imperfect information. 5. the book is very easy to read. the explanations are very clear. 6. the author partions the book into parts relevant to economics-math-philosophy students. i would recommend reading all the sections.
