 After 18 years of marriage, I sought an appropriate book that might help me become more pleasing to my husband. I could find no detailed explanations in christian literature, although I knew that the Bible explicity tells the "older women to teach the younger women HOW to love their husbands"...so I sought a book that might not violate my conscious. I bought this book because I thought the author might be sympathetic to women who are turned off and feel violated by explicit pornographic photos. This book had no photos but it does take unexpected turns that does violate the consciouses of women who have christian character. There are subjects that I just prefer not to know about when I search on enriching our love life!... The only redeeming factor was the complete description of the male anatomy and a few sporatic suggestions about technique. I just felt that all the accolades this book has received, someone needs to warn those who are wanting to perserve the sanctity of the marriage bed, this book is not for them.
