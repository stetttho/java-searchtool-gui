 I have no ability to ascertain what the average person looks for in a travel book, but this volume fufilled all of the basic needs that I had. It gives the reader information about the many areas of the country, including prices, popular attractions, and practical information such as how to use the public telephones (not obvious!), etc... My favorite aspect of the book is that it gives detailed listings ofresturants and eateries within a wide price range. I hesitate to give this book a better rating, simply because  the introductory history is somewhat biased and maybe unecessary ( unless you have no familiarity with german histoy. ) and the book is narrated in a fashion that I found slightly vague and irritating. ex; the book mentions that there is always plenty going on in Goettingen, but neglects to say what... but thats trivial, really, and it will answer your basic travel concerns.
