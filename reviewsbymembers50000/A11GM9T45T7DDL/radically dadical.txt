 ok, so they DO WAX their boards before they paddle out AND girl was started by spike jonze, rick howard, and mike carrol, along with contributor rudy johnson. rick howard is a lanky man hailing from the great country of canada, who did not finish high school and swith 360 flipped on the beryl banks in north redondo to the the tune of rick james. mike carrol was a child prodigy of skateboarding and made his name known on the now defunct embarcedero of san francisco. he was so famous within the skateboard community, that as a youngster, he was the subject of vicioius backlash. i have skateboarded with both of these men in the greater los angeles neighborhood. spike jonze, on the other hand, is a talented filmaker who needs no introduction and rudy johnson, like many of the girl family, has had a pro model out for years without even skateboarding. i hope this clarifies things.
