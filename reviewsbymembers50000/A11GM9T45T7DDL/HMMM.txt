 SPIKE JONZE DOES NOT OWN GIRL SKATEBOARDS. Unless there was a recent development, Girl is a company started and owned by a certain Rick Howard, professional skateboarder. I would , however, recommend all of his Spike's Girl skateboards videos, especially MOUSE, which along with Welcome tko Hell, formed a special period in the short history of skateboarding. This book has nothing to do with the artform I grew up with, (im 20) in the sense that skateboarding is something to be experienced first... reminisced about later, and the objects of inquiry are themselves, not that interesting or complicated.
