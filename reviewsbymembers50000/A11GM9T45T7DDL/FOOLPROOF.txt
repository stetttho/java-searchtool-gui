 The truth is, that before the south beach diet I was mortally obeese. I could have died. I had no friends and was afraid to leave the house because of the stares I would get. I tried to stop eating bad food, and I tried to do what I could to exercize, but I was not strong enough. The south beach diet has changed the world that I live in. I no longer am afraid that the children will call me a "whale, mommy, a real whale!". I no longer have to wear sweatpants, and finally found a job other than telemarketing. I am still 180 pounds at 5'4, but I have never felt more alive. My boyfriend and I exercize everyday and follow strictly the helpful advice that Arthur has to say. I have been fooled by other plans, but this one is the real deal. Thankyou Arthur!
