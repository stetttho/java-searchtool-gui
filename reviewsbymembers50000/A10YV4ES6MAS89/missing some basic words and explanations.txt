 I was perfectly content with this Swahili dictionary as a desktop reference ... until I noticed that it doesn't include some very obvious nouns, such as cheetah (duma), ruby (yakuti), or tarantula (bui). It also neglects to mention that many of these words will only be understood by 'formal' Swahili speakers on the coast and in Nairobi. Inland speakers use a related, but less complex, form of the language. Still, this works for a basic at-home reference, especially if combined with an online Swahili translation reference such as the Living Swahili Dictionary (...)
