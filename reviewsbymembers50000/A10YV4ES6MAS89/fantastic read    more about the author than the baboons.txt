 I picked up this book immediately after finishing several works by Jane Goodall, and I was anticipating another in-depth exploration into primate society.  I was surprised.  Though 'A Primate's Memoir' does indeed describe the personalities and events in several baboon troops, the larger portion of the book focuses on the author and his colorful experiences in East Africa. That said, I have to recommend this book as a fantastic read.  The many anecdotes are both hilarious and alarming, very well-written and often thought-provoking.  He writes with a humor not often found in 'my life in Africa'-type autobiographies, which makes me think he loves the place as much as I do.  And the chilling final chapter, describing conditions and events in certain (unnamed) East African game parks, was worth the price of the book by itself.
