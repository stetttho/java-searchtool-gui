 From the moment he saw this bed, our (huge) kitten was in bliss! He curled up and slept inside it, he dragged it around, he played with it (the best game is to unfold the sides into a 'tube' configuration and throw a toy inside. He'd go crazy digging out the toy!) and, when he started to get bigger, we just flipped it upside-down and he used it as a hammock. These beds might not last forever, but you can get a lot of them for the price of one fancier-looking but much less fun bed.
