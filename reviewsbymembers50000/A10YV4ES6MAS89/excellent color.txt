 After taking pictures in Africa, Turkey, Greece, Alaska, and many other places, I've learned (sometimes the hard way) to take film seriously.  A great camera will still take muddy pictures if the film quality is questionable. I recently loaded this Kodak Gold Max 400 film into a new camera to take a test roll before another trip, and was surprised by the wonderful color quality of the returned pictures.  A second test roll, taken of brightly-colored holiday decorations, came back excellent as well.   Now, if Amazon would only sell it in 10-packs, I'd be happy...
