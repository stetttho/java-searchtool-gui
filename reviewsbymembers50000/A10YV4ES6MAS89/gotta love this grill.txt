 This is a quality grill.  It arrived in perfect condition, and we put it together with minimal effort.  The parts are sturdy and well-fitting.  Several thoughtful little details (such as the flip-up panel on the grill that allows you to add more charcoal) make things easy for BBQ beginners like my husband and I.  The catch bin at the bottom is simple to use, prevents ash from blowing all over the yard, and you can make several dinners on the grill before needing to empty the bin. A chimney starter accessory is a must.  No more lighter fluid, no more endless waiting for the coals to get hot enough to start cooking.  It makes the difference between a barbequed meal being an hours-long production and a casual "Hey, why don't we barbeque that?" just before dinnertime.
