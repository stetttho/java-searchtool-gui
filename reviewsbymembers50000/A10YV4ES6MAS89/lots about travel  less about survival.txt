 If you're thinking of travelling to a jungle area, this book is indispensible.  It has well-thought out information about everything from health to culture shock, dealing with guides, children in the jungle, how to behave when interacting with tribal populations, what to pack, group dynamics, managing a mosquito net, the truth about ants, how to tolerate being wet all day, how to use a machete... literally everything you'll need to know. My only criticism is that the information about jungle survival (as opposed to travel) is only one chapter, and though it is also well-written, is limited in scope.  My sense is that this was an excellent travel book with some survival information thrown in at the last minute to justify putting 'survival' in the title.  Therefore, hard-core survival researchers might be disappointed.  All others are likely to tremendously appreciate this book.
