 My husband and I first discovered this game in an arcade, and after we built up the nerve to try it, we were immediately addicted.  When we learned that the home version includes a Workout Mode (in which you input your weight and either the amount of time you want to dance or the number of calories you want to burn) we had to give it a try.  It has quickly become our favorite way to exercise, both alone and together.  We love to watch our increasing scores and decreasing waistlines! (The soft dance pads do slide on the carpet a little bit, but not enough to be a problem.  We just readjust their positions after every few songs -- no big deal.)
