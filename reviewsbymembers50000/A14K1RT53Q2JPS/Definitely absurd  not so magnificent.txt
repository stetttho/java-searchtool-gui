 I have a well-calibrated surround sound system and was interested in this product as it seemed that it might be useful for showing off my gear. I can sort of use it for that...depending on the audience. If the audience has already experienced a decent 5.1 encoded DVD, this disc will bore them. The 5.1 mix seems "sterile" - as though the goal was to throw a particular sound exclusively to a channel. While it's true that putting 5 discrete sounds in 5 discrete channels will demonstrate a 5.1 system, half of the tracks on this disc seem to do nothing more than that. In that half, there's no depth...and frankly not much compelling content to listen to. The other half of the tracks do a decent job of showing off the audio system at-large, a scant few do justice at showing how powerful and immersive a quality 5.1 mix can be for the listener.
