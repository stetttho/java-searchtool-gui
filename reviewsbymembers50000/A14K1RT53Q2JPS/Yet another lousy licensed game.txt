 The Simpsons: Road Rage is, at best, a Crazy Taxi wannabe. This is the worst title I've played on the Xbox yet. The Crazy Taxi premise is okay - CT is one of my favorite games - but Road Rage suffers on many levels. The voice talent, while authentic, is very limited. Characters start repeating phrases within the space of a single run. It's annoying. The graphics are a cross between bad cel-shading and an intern's first attempt at 3D extrusion. Blech. The load times before and after each run are insane. I wonder if it's not a result of a "simple" port from one platform to another. This game was clearly not designed to take advantage of the Xbox's memory or graphic capabilities.  Rent it, play it, then get it out of your system - literally and figuratively.
