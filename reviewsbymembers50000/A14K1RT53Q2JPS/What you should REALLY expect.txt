 It did happen to me (well, my wife and me) and Martha does an excellent job of expressing the feelings and experiences that I went through while my wife was pregnant with our daughter. It's like she was there. While other pregnancy books treat pregnancy as an exercise in project management, Martha - and, in a few cameo sections, her husband, Adam - describe the human element of going through those 9 months. This book captures the fun, anxiety, amplified emotions and personal change that takes place during pregnancy. I'm fortunate to have spent time at work with Martha and Adam and I'm happy to say that these people are really as they are described in the book. They're nice, smart, funny and insightful - no embellishment is applied.
