 I use this AC Adapter with my Casio E-115. The adapter has a horizontal orientation, a first in my collection of AC adapters. The adapter doesn't hog an entire wall plate - the wire to the PDA runs out of the side of the  adapter, not the bottom. The adapter's shape doesn't encroach on the other  socket in a standard US wallplate. No lazy engineering here - Casio  realized that people might actually have something else to plug in. This  adapter rocks - it doesn't get hot, and it is lightweight. The only thing  missing is the great scent of pine! You know that you hate climbing under  your desk when you want to take your power supply home...and then having to  crawl back under when you bring it back to the office. Save your knees,  buy one for home and one for the office!
