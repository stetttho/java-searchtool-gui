 I attached the Advanced AV pack to my system last night and it really was like night and day. The S-Video connection to my Sony WEGA (non-progressive, non-HDTV) brought a much cleaner image.  However, the highlight is the TOSLINK optical connector. I moved an optical cable from my CD player to the Xbox Advanced AV pack (it's cool, the protective plug just gets pushed away - no little part to lose) and turned the Xbox back on.  I changed the settings in the Xbox audio to enable DD 5.1 and DTS, then loaded Halo. It's just incredible. Voices are directionally accurate, the overall sound quality is awesome. If you've already invested in a compatible TV, receiver and an Xbox, the Advanced AV pack will double the quality of your investment.
