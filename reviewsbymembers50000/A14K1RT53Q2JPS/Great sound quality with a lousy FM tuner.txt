 If you're buying this player because of the included FM tuner, don't. Every FM station's signal that I tune in with the Pocket Concert is weak and noisy, while other radio tuners in the same location pick up a perfect, strong signal. Fortunately, I didn't buy this device for the FM tuner - I bought it because of its support of Windows XP and the Windows Media Audio format. Setup was mindlessly simple, I followed the clear directions, installed the software, connected the device and my Windows XP notebook recognized it immediately. A quick trip to the Intel website and I downloaded a fresher set of XP drivers and a firmware upgrade that greatly improves the function of the FFWD and REW buttons. I was blown away with the ease-of-use. The upgrade also allows for direct support of Windows Media Player. You can manage the files on the device directly from WMP without needing to use Intel's included manager. Other than the FM tuner quality, the only problem I have with this player is the absence of direct DC adapter support. Battery life is 2xAAA = 10 hours or so. The Intel accessory pack's docking cradle is the only way to have audio playback without draining batteries, though, while connected to the PC, the player is powered by the USB.
