 One of the first things to be said about this book is that it is eminently readable and feasible. This, alas, is by no means always true of books dealing with so broad and deep a subject in less than a hundred pages. This is the right guide for people looking for a book which explains Zen in a way that everyone can understand, something comprehensive but not too long. They will find in it exactly what they need, written with lucid, direct and contemporary style. The author is the director of the Montreal Zen Center. He is a layman, not a monk, and has devoted his last 30 years to  the practice first and to initiate others. He received the full trasmission as a teacher of Zen from Roshi Phillip Kapleau. There is a French and Spanish version of this book. It is just a basic guide for beginners.
