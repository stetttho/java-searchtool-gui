 There are several commentaries in English to the Mumonkan written by Japanese monks and translated into English. The version and the commentaries have been written in English by the author, a Western Zen master who completed the study of the full series of koans in the West under the supervision of Roshi Phillip Kapleau.  The author is the director of the Montreal Zen Center and lectures on koans during the sesshin. His students study koans during and outside their practice of zazen. The study of the first koan facilitates a first glimpse into the original true nature that must be acknowledged by a enlightened master. Subsequent koans enrich the realization, favoring the understanding of the complexities and perplexities of differentiation and penetrating into the denotations and connotations of words and phrases. This book includes first class working material. If there is a Zen master, his or her instructions must be followed. If not, each koan and comments may be read several times during the week in different states of mind enhancing a certain degree of absorption and awareness.
