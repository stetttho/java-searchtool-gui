 This is a quite innovative book written for Zen practitioners who do not have direct or regular access to a Zen teacher or for college graduates who are used to look for a sound psychological, philosophical and byological background to Zazen issues. The author was a high school teacher of English in Japan enrolled in Zen practice for 72 years. After retirement he spent ten years supervising training and performance of Zen students in Honolulu and London. This book evidences his professional mastering in the art of teaching. This book has a very clear structure and facilitates the understanding of many details that currently are absent in conventional books because they are exchanged in face-to-face meetings between teacher and disciple.  He remained a layman and considered unnecessary to become a monk. The physiology of attention and breathing is studied in technical and well founded terms. The working on koans is approached keeping in mind that many Western Zen practitioners rarely pursue their training in a monastery. Cognitive aspects involved in the process of samadhi, awareness, awakening, knowing and being without thinking are broken down, analyzed and illustrated thoroughly and accurately. The final manuscript was reviewed by a collaborator, a lecturer at the University of Cambridge. There is a companion book of the same author, Two Zen Classics, that introduces and comments the two main collections of koans. There is also an good Spanish version, published by Editorial Kairos in Barcelona, and the title Zazen.
