 I bought this DVD Friday to enjoy it during a bankholiday and I have enjoyed it each day. The chorus performance in "va pensiero" is so impressive that enjoy it four times each performance because the audience obtained an encore when it was performed. Guleghina and Jones fit into the character as a ring to the finger. The darkness and light contrast in the revolve of Assyrian versus Israel choirs is highly effective and the setting of fire of Bible scrolls in the Jerusalem Temple make the end of Act 1 unforgotable. Also the distruction of Baal temple in Act 2 sets the limits to understand Nabucco's insanity. At Met they know how to make credible special effects on stage and on multimedia. Just buy (or rent) the DVD and enjoy it. There is nothing else I can say.
