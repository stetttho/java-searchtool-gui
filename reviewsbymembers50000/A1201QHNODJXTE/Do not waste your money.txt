 At first glance, this is a PDA but in fact the calendar is for displaying the date and time only. It is said in the box that it is compatible with several MS-Outlook but in fact it requires three transformations to synchronize the contacts agenda between the PC and the PDA. The PDF manual supplies a minimum of information abut how it operates and it is necessary to download html file from ... to find out what can be done. It looks like a PDA, but many functions are incomplete and very unfriendly. I think I have wasted my money.
