 In this book there are five short stories with the strenght and the vigor that made The Old Man and The Sea of Heminway a masterpiece. That is, small doses ready to produce great impact in the emotional mind of the Zen student. Somehow these short stories may be considered 1990s vintage koans, appellation controlee by the Montreal Zen Center. Also this book is a blend of carefully selected talks and articles giving a smooth and satisfying aroma of Albert Low's cellar. This production was started when he was a direct collaborator of Roshi Phillip Kapleau, the senior Zen-grower in the US.  An apple never falls far from the tree.
