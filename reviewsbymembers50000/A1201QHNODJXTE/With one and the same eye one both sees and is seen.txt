 For centuries, Zen has been concerned only with Absolute Mind. If you read this book, you will realize that everyday mind is just the way. A koan is the springboard to a deeper pool of understanding in every chapter, pushing the reader towards further experiential inquiry. The author avoids to handle the koan intelectually, placing the reader in the crux of a paradox that must be broken to go ahead surviving each chapter.  The are many other books where the focus is the content of the mind. However this book is concerned with mind itself. The purpose is to learn how to stop thinking to go beyond thinking. This is the right way to arouse the mind without resting it upon anything.  The illusion of unity and diversity, of a correct question and answer, of an insider and an outsider, of the viewpoint of an actor and an audience, of Me and I, of where is the center are analysed in detail. The author is the director of the Montreal Zen Center. He is a layman who has devoted  30 years to  practice and to assist others in their way to awareness and awakening. He received the full trasmission as a teacher of Zen from Roshi Phillip Kapleau. There is a French version of this book.  This is a book for advanced Zen students looking for a tool to startle the consciousness into enlightenment.
