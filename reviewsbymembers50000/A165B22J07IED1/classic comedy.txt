 This movie, or film, is a comedy about the dawn of civilized man - mainly cave men learning how to be civilized - and the creation of society. It is in the form of the old Greek comedies with funny but insightful dialogue and characters. This probably stems from the fact that it was made in Italy, which stems partly from Rome, which stems partly from Ancient Greece. It also has a touch of simple foolishness and campy style that may or may not be to your liking. To me anyway,  it is a timeless, low grade film that is worthy of cult classic status. However, it is probably too unknown to ever receive this attention.
