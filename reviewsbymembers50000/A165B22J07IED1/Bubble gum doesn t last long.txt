 The problem with Pop music, especially bubble gum pop like Spears, is that after one of her hits gets played a million time on the radio and the simple catchy melody that gets stuck in your head finally fades away, its not something you really want to hear again. In other words, music like this has no lasting power, and even if you liked it when it came out, it is already worn and out dated by now - so why try to buy it all again in a greatests hits collection? Not all Pop is this ephemeral, Michael Jackson and Madonna have been able to generate lasting pop songs, but Britney doesn't have the same weight and her songs lose flavor quickly, as does bubble gum after you chew on it for ten minutes or more.
