 This is just another insipid release from the Orange Mountain label, which keeps putting out anything with the Philip Glass name on it - even if it is flagrant garbage. Several releases have been issued which about 90% have the same old songs, just performed by different people.  In fact, Philip Glass has become more banal and bovine in the last few years because he knows anything with his name on it will sell to the trendy modernistic music crowd. Overall, I believe it is time to stop recycling Glass.
