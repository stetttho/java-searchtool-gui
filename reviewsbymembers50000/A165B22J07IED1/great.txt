 This book is full of great songs, and they are simple to play in terms of basic fingering. The hard part is the mastering of the speed of many of these songs, which takes several years of serious practice and study. This is why the book is great because these songs sound good at slower speeds and so you can enjoy them at a novice level. At the same time, you can use them to develop skills in speed and grace by repeated practice. I strongly suggest getting the issue of this book that has the CD of the songs, played by Ben Bolt, included. It will help you realize how you should sound playing them after several years of practice. All the while, as I said, they sound nice at the novice level too.
