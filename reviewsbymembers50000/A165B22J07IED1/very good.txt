 This film is very good. It really doesn't try to be very fast or furious, but instead really dedicates its content to some real life issues for once. It is like an indie film, since it deals with an issue not usually approached, so it will be probably loved or totally rejected by the individual viewer, depending on your particular interests. Worth renting at least.
