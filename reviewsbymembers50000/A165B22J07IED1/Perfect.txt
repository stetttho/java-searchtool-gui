 This is one of the very best bluegrass/old country recordings of all time. It is not some sort of phony pop imitation of this music, but is really old time music - raw and real and original. They even mention in the inlay booklet that this album is intended to stay true to real, genuine bluegrass music. It really does this, and has infinite replay value because the songs are timeless and the recording quality is great.
