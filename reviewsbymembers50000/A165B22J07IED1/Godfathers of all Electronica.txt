 It all started here. All genres from rap to goa trance to alternative rock owe alot to these Godfathers of electronic music and experimentation. Afterall, David Bowie is quoted saying he only listened to this album once on tour, and Coldplay admitted their hit song Talk was really a cover song with words of Kraftwerks Computer Love - another album to check out. This album is a classic and should not be missed, and is a landmark album in the development of music and will be liked by any true music lover.
