 Imagine three minature Jackie Chan's fighting their way through different misadventures in their pursuit of their lost pet bird, and you have Young Dragons in a nutshell. Its kung-fu and comedy combined, with alot of the laughs coming from the absurdity of the fight scenes and the story itself! Its an old film, so the special effects and high budget explosions of modern action movies are absent, but they're not needed really - they certainly were not needed in the old Bruce Lee films.  Just keep in mind you'll have to have an appreciation for the old, low effect kung-fu films of 20 years agon to like this one. Its sort of a kids movie, but amusing to adults with a sense of simple humor.
