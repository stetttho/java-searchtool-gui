 This book is metaphysics from the bottom up, which makes it interesting for anyone who likes philosophy and thinking about lifes meaning, and also feels too overwhelmed with those thick super dense writings by the classic guys like Kant. This might open up those more distant figures to a practical understanding too. A must read overall for anyone who likes to think about things, and maybe will be inspired to actually brave the readings of Kant, which are in fact worthy of reading, but with an active and exciting approach - instead of the too often pendantic one used in alot of schools. Its like going on a road trip with Sartre and Kant in the back seat of your car in a way.
