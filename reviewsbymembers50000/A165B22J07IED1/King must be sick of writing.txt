 This final book is terrible. All of the complaints so many people have about it being rushed, and being a let down in the end, are understated at best. King basically seems to have just been trying to get it all over with in this one, so he rushed through the story, superficially dropping off the supporting characters like Eddie, while at the same time bringing in the artist kid like an easy dab of plot line superglue. This is very sad and disgraceful, considering that this is Kings supposedly greatest life's work, and the first four books were very good - Why did he have to go and ruin it on some crash course and shoddy spree to the finish line? Overall, a major downer.
