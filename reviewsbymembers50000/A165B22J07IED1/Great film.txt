 Firstly,  should say that this film does not have Tom Waits in it as indicated on the display page. There is another movie by the same names that does have Tom Waits in it but its not this film, although Tom Waits would have been cool in this one. This is based on Grimm fairy tales and is filmed in a very candid and narrative manner, which makes it an intelligent movie for kids and also an everlasting tale for an adult too. Great work everyone and have a good day!! See you at the movies, or in this case at the good old VCR and the VHS - not betamax though, sorry Sony - geez you'd thought I was captious or something - ha!
