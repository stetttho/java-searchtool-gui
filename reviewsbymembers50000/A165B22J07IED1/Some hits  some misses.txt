 This compilation from Blue Room contains great tracks and some mediocre tracks - like most techno compilations usually do.  The best I think is Spectral's Avalon, which is a deep ambient groove - part Goa and part minimalist chill out. It is probably the best of that genre. Overall, its worth the used price for just that song, and all the rest is either going to be what you want or not, depending on your own personal preferences.
