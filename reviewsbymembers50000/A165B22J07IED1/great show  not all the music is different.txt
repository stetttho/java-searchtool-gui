 This show was rare, not too many on tv with a diverse and unique array of characters. The writing is original and daring at times. It is true that the music is changed, perhaps copyright issues were involved since alot of the music was from actual recording artists like Edith Piaf, Jimi Hendrix, Danny Kaye, Steven Sondheim, and many other copyrighted recordings. Anyway, I have a fairly comprehensive track listing of the original shows and the artist if anyone needs it. This list is not perfectly complete however. The shows are still worth the money, and the music that is in them isnt that bad. It is worthy of note that not all the music has been changed or edited, just watch the episode "Thanksgiving" and you still hear Django Reinhardt, or watch "The Bad Seed" and at the end you hear the same Brian Eno song that is on the soundtrack CD. I have a complete track list for each episode if anyone needs it.
