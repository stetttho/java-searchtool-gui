 This book is boring, poorly written and disgusting. All Debartolo does is make Mad look like a has-been long lost and sold-out business. On top of this, there is a rather disturbing homoerotic S&M photograph midway through the book, which I still can't understand why its there, as it has no place in the context of the book, and it's inclusion is not explained at all. I really get the idea that this book was not even welcomed by the Mad staff, and that Debartolo made a mistake that he knew he had to finish  once it was begun. Save your money and buy the other book about Mad called Completely Mad - its much better.
