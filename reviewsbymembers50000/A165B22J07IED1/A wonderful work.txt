 This film is a masterpiece. It captures the depth of the developmental psychology of Erik Erikson with its main character who is confronting the trials and tribulations of growing up and the stolid disillusionment which is impressed upon him by adult who have lost their imaginations. The movie plays wonderfully with the duality of childhood imagination and adult ratiocination, and thusly presents to us a coming of age drama,  while at the same time framing this with a comic sensibility. The dialogue between the overzealous bridge entrepreneur and the troll seeking kid is both frightening in an Orwellian sense and funny as it has the right touch of dark humor - which is maintained brilliantly throughout as the kid continues to be at odd's with the adults he encounters, all whom keep refusing to believe in the existence of trolls. Finally, the kid discovers an underworld where his imagination proves to be real, and the final hero is the boy himself, who endeavors to save the world of imagination from the destructive hyper-rationality of the grown-up world. This film is both thought provoking and at the same time accessible to children, who may not quite get the deeper motifs and symbolism, but will surely be motivated to ponder these very issues which will be presented in time as they reach the adult world. Overall, this short film is a master piece, and any one who doesn't think so I believe is not seeing beneath the surface, and perhaps is unfortunately too similar to the unimaginative, insipid adults which the film protrays as the antagonists to the powers of imagination and the creative mind.
