 This music is classic Philip Glass minimalism, and is comparable to Einstein on the Beach and Koyaanisqatsi in terms of the sound and style of the compositions. These songs are not as long as  those on these other albums, which makes this album short and sweet and may be a good introduction to his work from this period to someone checking out Philip Glasses music from this period for the first time. It should be noted that these songs are very, very minimal - so for those who like Glass but not the older minimalism stuff, you may consider it.
