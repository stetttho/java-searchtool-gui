 Those who have complained about the first season are totally wrong. There is nothing wrong with the episode seqences or the packaging or anything else. The presentation is in order and the shows are easy to access from a main index screen. The picture and sound quality is great, and there is more than enough extra footage and deleted scenes stuff to make even the most fanatical NE fan happy. The second season, which includes classic episodes like Spring Break, and the writtings of major NE contributors like Robin Green and Diane Frolov, make it one of the best. In terms of the claims some have made about the price being high, its not so bad when you figure you're paying about 6 dollars an episode, which is totally worth it considering shows like this are becoming extinct in the world of television. Anyone who appreciates quality television should certainly find this dvd to be a great buy.
