 This movie is okay, but does not feel complete. The people in this one are not expressed enough in the movie, and I felt at the end that this played out more like a long trailer for a movie instead of a completed one. Morris had a good idea here, but it seemed too brief and desultory throughout. It's worth watching, but it leaves you wanting more depth and length. Possibly Morris at the time this was made had not totally developed his documentary style, it does play like a sort of practice film compared to other works such as Gates of Heaven and the First Person series.
