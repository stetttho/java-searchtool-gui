 Stephen King should just give up already, he is boring and wortheless ever since IT. The king was be dethroned. End of story, this is a fact. Also, DT 7 was a joke, can you even believe it? I just don't even care about that one because one time I was reading it but then it was so very boring and then I didn't want to have bought it but I already did from the store so what a waste of money anyway huh? Oh yeah, its not very solid in the plot either, really though, he just puts in a cheap ending too.
