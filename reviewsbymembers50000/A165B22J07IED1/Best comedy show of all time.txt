 This performance is the best comedy performance from any comedian to have ever lived. People like to compare him to Lenny Bruce, but, with all due respect,  Hicks was better than Bruce and better than any one else in the history of comedy.  This is an incontrovertible fact. Until you see this performance, you have not seen the best comedy ever made. Its even better than the other DVD's of Hicks because it is less commercial, and therefore more effective in conveying his raw on-stage power and immediacy. Perhaps you think I'm exaggerating,just wait till you see Sane Man and, notwith- standing the some times out-of-date material, realize he was the king of realcomedy. Even the out-of-date references to some politicians and musicians are just as valid today and are applicable to many of our present "rock stars" and politicians. Everything he ever said was absolutely right.
