 this album, because of its unpolished raw recording, best captures the musical power of AS. It sounds just as if you are at some back ally punk club - complete with poor, subpar sound systems. This is the result of having been unprofessionally recorded on a tape player, at such an event. Nothing is better then raw recordings of punk, since studio recordings only subtract from the effect that punk is supposed to create in the first place.
