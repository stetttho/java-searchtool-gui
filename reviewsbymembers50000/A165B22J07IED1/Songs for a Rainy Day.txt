 This all piano recording is some of the most minimal of all Glass compositions - so in order to find this appealing the listener should be a decided fan of minimalism. That being said, it is fine music indeed, Glass uses his bittersweet motifs throughout the recording, lots of repetition on a few basic chords. Mad Rush is I believe one of his best, most signature works of all time, because it totally captures his  use of counterpoint to an effect of an ethereal auditory ambience. Mad Rush alone makes this worth buying.
