 This album was dedicated to the awesome comedian Bill Hicks, who actually opened for Tool back in the 90's, and which lyrics in this album were based upon his comedy. The final song, Third Eye, actually has samples of Bill Hicks performing, and in the inside cover of the album there is a dedication to Bill Hicks as 'another dead hero.' Overall the music is awesome, both dark, heavy and full of emotional capability - either of sadness, anger or both. Anyone who likes Tool should check out their hero, Bill Hick's, on DVD and on CD.
