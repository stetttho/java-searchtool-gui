 I went to a store and looked at both this 10 -1/4 inch skillet and also the 12 inch one. Because of the short handle, the 12 inch one felt really heavy and unweildy to hold with one hand. And if it was scalding hot, that might be pretty scary.   This one (10- 1/4) is much more manageable. It's plenty of room for most tasks - can hold about 4 eggs or 6 strips of bacon with breathing room. I could fit two chicken quarters in there (leg and thigh x 2) with a little breathing room.  For some bigger jobs, I might want the 12 inch, but this is the right one for my daily cooking.  The pre-seasoning is great. I owned a non-seasoned one in the past and it took quite a while to get it seasoned. I washed this one with soap the first time I got it, and then after that I  never used soap again. I just scrub off anything stuck (boiling water if needed to loosen it) and then reheat to drive off any water, then coat with a light coating of oil.  I love the way cast iron holds all that heat and doesn't cool down when you add food. I like it a lot better than Teflon.
