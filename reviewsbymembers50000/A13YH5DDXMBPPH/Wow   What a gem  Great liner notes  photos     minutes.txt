 Whoever put together this CD went *way* beyond the call of duty and certainly met a standard much higher than the normal treatment given to best-of compilations. This was certainly a labour of love! The twelve page  insert booklet contains liner notes describing the story of each album.  There are photos plus pictures of each of the album covers involved. I  especially dig the photos on the front and back of the CD and the graphic  behind the clear plastic under the CD! Brilliant! Reminds me of the old  vinyl days when you got great art and liners and surprises inside. Oh, yeah  i should add that the selections are terrific and at 77 minutes this is a  LOT of music for your buck. And after giving us all this, the price is low  too!  Way to go, Island!
