 Contrary to an earlier posters comments, I have been able to shred entire credit card offers without even opening the envelope! Even the ones that contain a fake plastic credit card inside! This is why I bought this shredder, and so far (8 months) it has given me no problems whatsoever. I saw the replacement model for this (PS-65C) and it looks ugly. I think I would try to buy a PS-60C if you can still find a source...  This is a really good product for the price.
