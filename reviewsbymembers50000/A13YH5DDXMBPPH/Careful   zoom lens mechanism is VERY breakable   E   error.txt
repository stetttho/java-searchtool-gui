 Read reviews of the A70. The E18 error is alive and well still in the A75!  What this means is that the gears that move the zoom lens are exposed to the elements by means of the gap between the lens and the body. All it takes is a piece of dust or sand to blow in there and the lens will freeze up and you will get an E18 error. Then you have to mail your camera to Illinois and wait several weeks. If it happens after a year has passed and the warranty is void, your camera is a paperweight. If you have scuffs on your camera, Canon might even choose to void the warrenty due to neglect.   This happens to alot of people, google "Canon" and "E18".I had my A75 for only 4 days before the E18 error happened.  If you get this camera, keep it in an airtight dust free case at all times!
