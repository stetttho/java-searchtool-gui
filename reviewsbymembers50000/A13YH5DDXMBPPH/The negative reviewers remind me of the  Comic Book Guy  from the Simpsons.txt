 You know the guy who attends Star Trek conventions and grills the actors about the various small holes in the plot....  The space geeks are really having a field day with some of the errors in the book. So be it. This is not a book for the most highly knowlegeable space geeks, anyway. What the book delivers is a compelling and very interesting drama that is far more personal (more quotes from astronauts and others in the program) than other books published at the time of this book's release.   I'm glad Harry Hurt III wrote this... it was a good read and was very enjoyable.
