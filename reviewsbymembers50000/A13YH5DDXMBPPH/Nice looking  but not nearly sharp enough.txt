 The trend for high end steak knives these days is to make them teeny tiny.  I liked these knives because they are bigger and look nice. So I got them even though they were cheap and I was suspicious about their quality.  Unfortunately, when I got them I discovered that they don't cut steak all that easily. I have some even cheaper steak knives with serrated blades that cuts much better than these.
