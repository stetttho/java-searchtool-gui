 I like so many others think this comeback special is Elvis' finest onscreen appearance. Aside from some of the dated production numbers that didn't age well, this show captures the pure magic of Elvis, just prior to when his amphetamine use started becoming obvious and ruining his onstage charm.   One thing that is interesting about the extra material... frankly you may only need to view it once because a lot of it is nothing special. The editors of this TV special did a fantastic job and truly picked most of the best moments from the show. For example, he probably did 20 takes for the opening bit (Guitar man)... and the only one that REALLY captured the swagger and lip curl of the man we love was the one they use... in all the others, he's not quite right or is goofing around too much.  One thing that is a little disturbing about some of the extra footage is you realize that he is lipsynching more than is readily obvious.  I guess I'm saying that if I could buy the main DVD and rent the other two DVDs to just watch once, I would rather do that to save money. But this show is an absolute must have for anyone who loves Elvis. His genuine warmth and southern boy niceness, his soul and smoothness, his incredible sexyness, and the crazed hysterical reactions of the female fans come through perfectly in this film.
