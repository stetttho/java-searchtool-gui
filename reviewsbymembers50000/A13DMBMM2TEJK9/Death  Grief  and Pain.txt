 I took this collection of short stories on vacation but put it down about half-way through.  Most of the stories are about loss-- many of anguished mourning mothers berift and in unimaginable pain. There is no humor here. The writing is very obtuse and difficult to follow.  I believe many of the "stories" are fragments of novels which might explain why they leave the reader with too many loose ends and unanswered questions and require a lot of work to understand, if they can be understood at all.  I hoped that this book might have an inspirational quality or be uplifting in some way, but the first half was dark, a real "downer". I would recommend the collection of Best Non-required Reading edited by David Sedaris or the Best Short Stories of 2005.
