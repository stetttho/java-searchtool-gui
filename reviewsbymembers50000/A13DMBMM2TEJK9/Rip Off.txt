 There I said it....it's a publishing ploy to ride the current of Mr. Tolle's well-deserved popularity.  Don't fall for it.  Read and reread The Power of Now. It's the best book I've ever read and yes, it did change my life. It's everything you could want to know. Stillness Speaks doesn't do anything for me or for that matter Mr. Tolle but make him look like a money-grubber and me like a fool for participating.
