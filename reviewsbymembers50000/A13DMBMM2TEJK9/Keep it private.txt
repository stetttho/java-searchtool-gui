 I was so excited to see a new Joan Didion book.  The White Album and Slouching Toward Bethlehem were the highest ideals for me as I struggled to be an essayist.  Joan was the most observant and deeply analytical and focused and organized--something this new book is NOT.  Maybe she needed to write this journal for herself to make sense of her loss and pain.  I heard her give an interview on NPR's Fresh Air with Terry Grosse and it was obvious that her pain is still so raw.  I wish Joan you had keep it private and let us remember you differently.
