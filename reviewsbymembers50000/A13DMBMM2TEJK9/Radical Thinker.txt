 I like Anne for her no-nonsense call-it-the-way-she-sees-it attitude which, as she describes, gets her into trouble time and again throughout her laid bare life which comprises the first third of the book.  Her honesty and humility is breath-taking. The book is a bit rambling with lots of repetition, references to her past books, long unedited letters received from supporters, but overall a radical well documented indictment of therapy and addiction treatment.  As a therapist, even before reading this book ,came to the realization that therapy as supported by third party payors (insurance and managed care) is a quick fix and often intrusive, arrogant, and not-respectful of a client's deep process.  Therapists, like the general public, are often unaware of the many types and kinds of addiction affecting clients.  I am most deeply concerned about how we set our children up for addictions beginning with repetitive movies as toddlers and video games.  This is a deeply disturbing book although it may be a bit overstated.  I recommend it highly.
