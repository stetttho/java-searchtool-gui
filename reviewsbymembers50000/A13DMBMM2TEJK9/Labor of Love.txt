 This is a beautiful book with gorgeous photographs and incredible knitting projects for a beloved dog.  It would make a handsome coffee table piece because of its unusual subject and lovely pictures.  I am knitting "Icelandic Beauty" for my "grand-dog" and the directions are very complete. I gave this book to them for Christmas with a handmade "gift certificate" for a sweater and they chose this one from among the many wonderful options. I am very pleased with this project and appreciate the attention to detail the author put into this.  I hope this book stays on the shelf for a long time.
