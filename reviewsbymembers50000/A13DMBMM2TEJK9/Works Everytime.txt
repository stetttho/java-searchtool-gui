 This is a wonderful book.  I am a child therapist and use it frequently to help children beleagured by nightmares and bad dreams.  The plentiful drawings are done by children and illustrate well the simple technique for confronting the images in the dream.  I like especially that the technique does not use violence to attack or destroy monsters, but emphasizes much more creativity.
