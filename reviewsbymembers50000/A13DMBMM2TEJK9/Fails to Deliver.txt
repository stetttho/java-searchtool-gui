 It's a great idea, but hardly a book's worth.  Fully one third of the book is listings of agents and publishers and a glossary--information available in other writers' directories and quickly outdated.  One third of the book is very useful information about editing, the query letter, a book proposal, and the publisher's contract--information generic to most books and available in other sources.  The third of the book related to the spiritual writer is poorly written and weak conceptually.  The chapter called "Seven Lessons of the Spirit" is a writing exercise which is of little or no value.
