 I really like how this new book is written even though most of what he covers was presented in The Power of Now.  It's a more flowing narrative and easy to grasp with good examples.  I enjoyed it immensely.  This information is so accessible; I would rate this as THE most important book of the decade.  It is my all time favorite.
