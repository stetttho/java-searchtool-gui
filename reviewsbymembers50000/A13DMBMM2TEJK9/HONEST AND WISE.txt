 I am delighted with this wonderful book of short stories, memoirs and verse from a long-lived woman who is both gutsy and deep.  "A Pampered Pilgrimage" is one story that demonstrates her willingness to receive help from her adult daughter on a somewhat arduous trek into the Sierra mountains to visit the spot where her husband's ashes were strewn.  It is a beautiful exchange between the women and one that touches my heart as I experience that subtle shift with my own son as he becomes the stronger and more capable of us and I surrender to my own vulnerabilites of age.  This is a book of important insights and spiritual wisdom to be read in bits and pieces while waiting somewhere or for a minute of calm before bed. It is rich in the experiences of a woman who has continually challenged herself to grow into her eighth decade.  She is a role model who will surprise and inspire you.
