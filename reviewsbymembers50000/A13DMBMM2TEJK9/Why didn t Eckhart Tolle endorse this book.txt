 Don't you think it odd that of all the endorsements of this book inside the front cover that Eckhart Tolle is nowhere to be found, not even in the acknowledgements?  All the more interesting because the book was published by Namaste publisher, the same one that publishes The Power of Now and The New World. This book, The Presence Process, is a cookbook, a how-to-do-it book  So, I'm going to do the circular breathing and get in the bathtub with an attendant and process all the junk that surfaces so that I can get in touch with my inner presence.  I think the reason Mr. Tolle didn't endorse this book is because it's a lot of hooey.  He, the master, says that it takes no time and nothing to know who you really are and tune into the egoless present.  I'm afraid Mr. Brown is trying to ride the master's fame with this long-winded, redundant, description of undoing, cooling, cleansing, and all the other hokey stuff Mr. Brown would have us do.  Save your money, save your time, and go back to the source, Eckhart Tolle, for the real truth. I think we've been "had".
