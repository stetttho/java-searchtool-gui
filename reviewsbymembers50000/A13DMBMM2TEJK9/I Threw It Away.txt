 Honestly I can't understand why this book gets so many stars from so many reviewers.  It had very little to say and the way it was said in a casual "shouting" put-down fashion was demeaning and disrespectful.  I'm glad I wasn't at the retreat where this was transcribed.  Some of De Mello's other books are quite good with deep and useful ideas and excercises and stories.  This one is a bust.  I had to lighten my luggage going on an international flight and this book was easy to dump.  If you want real spiritual direction there is no one finer than Eckhart Tolle.  The Power of Now and his latest New World are life changing.  Every rereading uncovers more and deeper truths.
