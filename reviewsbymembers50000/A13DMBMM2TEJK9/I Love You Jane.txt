 I love you for your unabridged honesty, for your humanity, for being one-of-us, for this enormous beautifully written testimonial to the power of learning, growing, evolving, and becoming a wise embodied being.  You are a light for me Jane.  I grew up with you.  Your history is my history.  Your struggles with being a man's woman parallel my own.  I am enchanted with your story.  In fact last night I dreamed about you.  You were in my house wearing a pink silk jacket just like one I own. You were coaching me to dream bigger, want more, stretch further. "It's not about money", you said, "Money's too easy. It's about having the courage to be yourself, live your truth, and do what you came here to do."  Thank you Jane.
