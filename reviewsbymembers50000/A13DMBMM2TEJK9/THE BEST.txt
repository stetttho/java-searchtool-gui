 I'm a therapist and lend this book out to clients who come for help with their depression.  When a copy gets "lost" I buy another.  Too many clients are feeling hopeless and wouldn't buy it for themselves on my recommendation, but reading just a few pages of this well written gem will convince them that there is much to learn and there is a path to getting well and feeling better.  It maps out the steps to take.  It's an easy read. It makes the process move much faster. Hats off to you John!
