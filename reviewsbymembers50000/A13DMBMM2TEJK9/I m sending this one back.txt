 There is more white space than words in this "artsy" book with disjointed sentences and corresponding haikus (called a haibun).  It is a difficult ambiguous read.  I don't want to work this hard.  Since there is nothing about the book in the description I took a chance.  I can't believe this got past an editor.  This book may be self-published.  I don't recommend it.
