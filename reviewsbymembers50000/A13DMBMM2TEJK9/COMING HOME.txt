 I departed from the Catholicism of my childhood but this huge impressive deeply researched and spiritually resonant work by the holy man, Paramahansa Yogananda, has opened my eyes and heart to the spiritual truth of Christ Consciousness.  I was led to this work, now compiled in two gorgeous volumns with extensive footnotes and beautiful pictures. It is a facinating read and one I am so grateful to have found.
