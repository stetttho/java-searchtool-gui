 A very good emotional book about World War II.  Steinman's father served in the Tropic Lightning Division of the U.S. Army fighting in northern Luzon (P.I.).  Even though her father is not a casualty, he suffers the rest of his life from the effects of the war.  He is hard and somewhat bitter.  After his passing, Louise finds the souvenir of the war---a personal flag from a Japanese soldier.  She examines the brutality of the war from both the American and Japanese perspective (Hiroshima, Nanking, P. I, Bataan).  She finds the family of the soldier and returns the flag.  She finds that the Japanese soldier has a human face after all. This is a good emotional read of the effects of war, even if the war was the good war.
