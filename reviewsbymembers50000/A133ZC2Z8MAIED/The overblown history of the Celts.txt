 This book was a disappointment.  As an Irish American, I wanted to learn a little of my ancestors.  What I got was a book that made some wild assumptions.  When the author stated that the Taureg nomadic people of North Africa may be related to the Celts, I nearly fell off my rocker.  The Taureg are the deepest black and to try to relate them to the Celts, well that was quite interesting.  In this book, the author aims some sharp jabs at the Romans, British, and the English royal family including Prince Charles.  I think those comments also may have been uncalled for. I learned a little about the Celts, but I think I may have to read The Celts by Nora Chadwick to get an objective view of the Celts.  For those who want a more objective view of the Celts, read elsewhere.
