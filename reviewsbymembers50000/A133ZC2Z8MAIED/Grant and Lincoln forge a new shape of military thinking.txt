 A short account of the final days of the Civil War where Grant forces Lee into bloody battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, North Anna, Cold Harbor, and Petersburg.  Grant forces the Confederates to use their most precious resource--manpower, and wins the Civil War.  Good insights on how Lincoln backed Grant to the full degree in his waging of the war.  Also a good overview of the final days in both Richmond and Washington D. C. For those who doubt Grant's genius, they should read this book.
