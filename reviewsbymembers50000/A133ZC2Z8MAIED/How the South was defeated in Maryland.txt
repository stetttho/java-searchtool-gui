 I think this was a short but well written book.  Most Civil War readers concentrate on Gettysburg as the key battle that decided the fate of the South.  McPherson shows the key turning point was Antietam, where the South was first turned back from the North.  They also lost any thought of France or England recognizing the independence of the South.  After this battle, it was all downhill for the South.  Lee was a dynamic general, but his rashness brought this battle to the North's win column.    This is a short book about the politics and diplomacy during the time of the battle.  What McPherson is trying to show is how the North came close to losing this war because of the tide of the general war.  Only twenty or so pages are concerned with the battle itself.  The focus is how the tide went out on the Confederates, and the better fortune of the United States.  The North came close to failure in this battle, but lost battle plans and poor decisions turned it into a small victory for the U.S.  This is a nice short read on a historic battle.  This is the fourth book I have read from this author.  McPherson's books are a joy to read.
