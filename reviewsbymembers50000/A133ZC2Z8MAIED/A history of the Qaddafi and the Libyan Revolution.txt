 First off, this is one of the rare books which shows the Libyan leader and what he stands for.  It was written in 1987, and does not take into account Libya's role in destroying Pan Am 103.  Desite being somewhat dated, Qaddafi's biography is depicted here.  For those who want to know why the world should be careful of this dictator, this is the book which shows the terrorism, murder, and cruel behavior of Qaddafi.  From the murder of dissidents and a police woman in London, to the bombing of a Berlin disco, the authors depict the nature of Qaddafi and his regime.  He has much in common with Saddam Hussein, even though Qaddafi hates him. I found the life of Qaddafi interesting.  He sometimes defies description.  He is a womanizer, but believes in Islam.  There are many contradictions in his character.  Nevertheless, he is a threat to the United States and western nations.
