 I didn't think this was a great book but it did give me some knowledge of how terrible the Black Plague and the terrible effects on Europe and Asia.  It really decimated the populations of Western Europe, almost to the point where civilization was at stake.  Cantor describes it as the modern day example of the atom bomb.  Cantor does some theorizing about the origin and the fact that the plague may have also been anthrax, and not the plague spread by rats.  He also theorizes what might have happened if the plague had not been.  Society and civilization may have developed faster, rather than recover from the population loss.   This is an OK read, and I learned something from Cantor's writings.  I am surprised others have rated this book so low, because it did give a side of the Black Plague that is rarely written about.
