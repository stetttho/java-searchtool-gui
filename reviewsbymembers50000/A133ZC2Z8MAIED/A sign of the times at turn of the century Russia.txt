 This is an OK read, and it certainly explains how a person like Rasputin could raise up to the very level of the ruling elite in Czarist Russia.  Russia was experiencing profound change, and the mores of society were changing.  Most Russians still clung to the Orthodox Church for support, although there were off shoots of this church that had changing morals in terms of behavior.  This explains why an uneducatated, deviant person like Rasputin could rise in his local community, then up the Orthodox Church, and finally attach himself to the Russian Monarchy because of the hemophilia of the heir Alexis. There are some nice pictures in this book, and the author paints an sympathic view of Rasputin.  Some may view him as evil, but I think this is an improper picture.
