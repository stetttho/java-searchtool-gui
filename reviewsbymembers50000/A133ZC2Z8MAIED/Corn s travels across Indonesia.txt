 A delightful book about Corn's travels around Indonesia.  If you plan of visiting the country, even for a trip to Bali--this is a nice book to read.  He visits such exotoc islands as Sumatra, Java, Timor (now part independent) Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Banda Islands, Seram, and Irian Jaya.  His desciptions are visions of a country with problems, but whose people meet these with a zest for life.  However, Corn does not describe some of the trouble that has just recently resulted in Christians and Chinese being killed.  Also lacking in the content is some of the history that would put events in perspective.
