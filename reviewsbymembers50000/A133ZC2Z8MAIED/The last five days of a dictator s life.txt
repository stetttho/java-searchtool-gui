 After reading this book, I realized how a cornered rat feels when he knows there in no way out. The book details the end of World War II in Italy and the last days in the life of Benito Mussolini.  At first it reports how Mussolini was surrounded by hundreds of faithful, including German soldiers detailed to protect him.  He runs here, then there in hopes of retaining a little more power.  In the end he is caught by the Communist partisans who execute him, rather than have him talk to the Allied governments. At least Mussolini faced his situation in the end with bravery. The book provides a negative view of the the Communist partisan who executed him and other Italian fascists, and the people of Milan who displayed his corpse and others.
