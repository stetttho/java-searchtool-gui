 Johnson does a great job of summarizing the Renaissance in a quick 150 pages.  The book summarizes the forward thinking which resulted in a revolution in the sculpture, paintings, and buildings of this period.  Man was outwardly focused during this time and shows developments in Italy and then in the rest of Europe. The problem that I find with these quick reads of a complex subject is they have so little space to explain the subject and adequately make it interesting.  Johnson does a great job in the summary but fails to motivate the reader to other works which expound on the Renaissance.   For those who need a quick read on this fascinating time in history, this is a quite capable book.  It describes the advancement in literature, sculpture, painting, and building of this period.
