 As some of the other reviewers have already related, I thought I would not like this book, but I did.  Scott O'Grady is an inspiration.  Not only did he survive a SAM-6 shoot down, but he become more focused in his life and belief in God.  During his evasion of Serb para military forces, he focused his energies on surviving another day despite food and water.   When one thinks of fighter jocks, people think of Tom Cruise and Top Gun.  O'Grady tells the truth.  These are conservative guys taught not to make great risks.  They are very professional in how they perform their duties.  This is demonstrated in this book.  Scott goes about his duties with clear thought and precise action.  Scott survived because he did as he was trained.  He did not take great risks.  This is a nice, inspirational read.  The book has a easy flow to it, and a reader will blow right through the pages.  Good reading.
