 Barbary's book is a nice quick summary of the war in the Crimea. The book is approximately 150 pages long, so the author gives a quick review of the battles including the Charge of the Light Brigade, and a review of Florence Nightingale.  The perspective is British, so don't expect to get a great viewpoint from the Russians or French.  One chapter deals with the experiences of Tolstoy in this war. Barbary treats the Charge of the Light Brigade in a different light than some other authors.  The General commanding the charge is praised as brave, while the fault is all laid at the feet of the Commander in Chief.  In the references, the author lists The Reasons Why book as an authority, but Barbary lays the blame on the Commander in Chief for this self destructive action. I list this as an average read of the Crimean War.  The book is interesting and short.  Those needing further details need to look elsewhere.
