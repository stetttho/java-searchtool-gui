 This was a nice story, but it was clouded by some very philosphical rantings by the son both early in the book and at the end.  Also troubling was the son's writing of his father's story.  He talkes about his father, then his grandfather and grandmother, and it is difficult to follow, especially early in the story. I wish he would have written it as his father's narrative as told to him.  This is a very harrowing account on how one person survived the Holocaust.  Skakun was blessed with blue eyes and blond hair, and it was fairly easy to pass himself off as an Aryan, with the exception of his circumcision.  Both passing into Germany and his physical for the Waffen SS necesitated him taking a physical in the nude.  I think his heightened awareness of how vulnerable he was resulted in a certain nervousness, which could have resulted in his uncovered secret identity.  This is a nice easy read about a very lucky Polish Jew.  His unconventional route and his luck led to him surviving the war.  Skakun credits the good deeds of his mother in his survival of the war.
