 As the previous reviewers have already noted, this is a great book defining how the Holocaust happened in one of the most civilized nations in Europe.  Wistrich notes the rise of anti Semitism in Germany and the rest of Europe during the ninetenth and twentieth centuries.  Even though thousands of German Jews gave their lives in the trench warfare on the Western Front during World War II, the Nazis blamed the Jews for the stab in the back.   In this book, Hitler's main aim was to rid Eurpe of all its Jews.  His goal continued despite setbacks on the fighting fronts.  Hungarian Jews were murdered up to the closing months of the war, even though Germany was in the process of being defeated.  Germany's loss was also blamed on the Jews. Wistrich gives us a scholarly analysis of why the Jews were selected, how the lack of solidarity in the Jewish population helped the Nazis kill their victims, and why the Western Allies did little to stop the killing.  As Wistich states, other genocides in later years just shows how little has changed in the history of genocide.  A minority group is selected for the blame of something, and revenge is exacted. This is a great scholarly read for why the Holocaust happened.  It places Hitler front and center in one of the greatest crimes of all time.
