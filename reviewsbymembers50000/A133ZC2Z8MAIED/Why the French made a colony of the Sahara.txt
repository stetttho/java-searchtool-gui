 Another fine book by Professor Porch.  If you liked his book on the Conquest of Morocco, then this book will also be a good read.  The only criticism I have of this book is that he didn't place any pictures in it, like he had in the Morocco book.  A more detailed map may also have helped. I agree with the previous reviewer about the intentions of the French.  Why conquer an enormous sandpit?  The answer is the French government did not know, and relied on the glory seeking soldiers of the French Army.  The soldiers were interested in the conquest and not the money and lives the government expended. Colonialism failed because it did not pay, and the French experience in the Sahara was a prime example.  Also answered the question why Algeria has a larger share of the desert than her rivals Morocco and Tunisia.  Only later when the French were fighting an independance war was oil in the Sahara found.
