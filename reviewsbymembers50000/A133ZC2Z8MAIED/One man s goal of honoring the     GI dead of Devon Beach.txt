 A few years ago, the story came out on how 946 American soldiers died when practice landings on the Devon Coast in Great Britain went terribly wrong.  This was due in no small part to Ken Small who lived in the region and beach combed as a hobby.  Small describes how he uncovered this little known story and the remains of this landing.  Along with the raids by German E-boats, several tanks sank during the initial landing.  Small uncovered one tank and arranged that it be brought ashore, repaired, and displayed as a memorial to those soldiers who died.  He battled both the American and British governments to accomplish this.  He also spent a small fortune in this effort. I admire the courage and fortitude of this man.  The book is his testament to the deaths of these 946 Americans, and the grateful expression of one English man for their sacrifice.  This is a pleasant read for those who think all Europeans have forgotten what the USA did for Europe in WWII.
