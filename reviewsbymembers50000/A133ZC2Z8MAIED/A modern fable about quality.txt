 I read this book back in the 80s and it is still quite relevant today.  It talks about a fictional company called Punctuation and how it lost market share to an up and coming company.  The reason they lost market share was due to quality.  How to reverse that trend is the nature of this story.  Suffice to say many companies (and bosses) continue to fall into the same traps to regain their market share and profitablity. This is a great and quick read about what quality should be.  Since it is so brief and the language is so simple, most reading audiences can easily understand the topic and moral of the story.  It would be a great book to hand out to production, service, and management personnel.
