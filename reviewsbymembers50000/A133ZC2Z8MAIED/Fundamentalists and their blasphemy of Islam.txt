 A good read about the crisis in Islam.  The reader gets to view how contemporary Muslims blaspheme their own religion by performing acts of terror that are not sanctioned by Islam.  Khomeini issues a fatwa ordering the death of a author in a remote land.  Lewis descibes how this is very much against the laws of Islam.  Imagine a holy man violating the very laws he has lived his life under.  Usama bin Laden orders suicide bombers to kill thousands of innocent men, women, and children.  Another blasphemy.  Islam condemns suicide and the killing of innocent people.  Yet the Muslim world just yawns, and says America deserves it.  Lewis does do a good job with detailing the crisis in Islam.  If this great religion comes under the control of such people as Khomeini and bin Laden, they will destroy this religion and the progression of their people.  Muslims must act to break these people who blaspheme their religion.  Despite the previous reviews, this book gives a lot on information on the Muslim attitude and what needs to change in order for this great religion to become a progressive part of their believer's lives.  The Muslim world cannot just blame the West for their problems.  They must actively focus on the problems which face their society without playing the blame game.
