 Derek is British by way of Australia.  In this book, he makes the Americans look like idiots waging war.  If you read this book, be prepared to see Americans killing Americanc, VC killing Americans, and the wonderful North Vietnamese killing Americans. Since this book came out in 1970, it was understandabe why Derek would be anti-war.  The history of the war is a little different. The kill ratio of Vietnamese to Americans were very different, and the North Vietamese were not angels.  The humor is OK, but this was a tragic war.  I did like the rivalry between Marines and Army.
