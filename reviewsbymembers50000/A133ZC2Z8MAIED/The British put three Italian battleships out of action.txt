 As the authors quite rightly put, this was the prelude to Pearl Harbor.  The Italian Navy was stationed at this harbor and posed a threat to British sea routes to Egypt, India, Singapore, and Australia.  A daring attack by 21 aircraft from a British aircraft carrier damaged three Italian battleships and put them out of action for six to nine months.  Since they were in a heavily protected shallow harbor, it was indeed a daring attack, which the Japanese copied to place the American Pacific fleet out of action.  The Japanese attack was on a much larger scale. One of the authors was a member of the attack group, and he gives his own account in the battle. This is a nice little read.  The book is short and has plenty of photos.  A determined reader could finish this book in two to three hours.  Taranto was indeed the prelude the Pearl Harbor, but now few people realize this.  With Lowry's perspective, this is good book about the Second World War.
