 The main theme in this book is that Hitler told everybody exactly what he was going to do prior to his selection as Chancellor.  Therefore it is no surprise when he instigated his murderous policies of war and genocide.  When the German people said they didn't know, Laffin states without hesitation that the majority of people knew exactly what Hitler was going to do.  When the countries which eventually fought Hitler stated they didn't know, Laffin states they should have known because of all his stated goals in speeches and his book.  If they didn't know, then they weren't listening. Laffin's book takes photos from a 1936 German publication, and then explains the text.  He also uses a chapter about a British soldier watching the rearming of Germany and explains the warning signals.  There are a lot of pictures in this book, and they are quite interesting.  The writing could be better, but the message is quite true.  The German people and the Allies decived themselves about Hitler's intentions.
