 I have read Cross's book about Kursk (Citadel) and I thought this would also be a nice read.  It was, even though the author trods on some well written ground with the end of the Third Reich.  There are no new discoveries in this book, just how Hitler was a complete military failure at the end of the war.  Hitler's decisions helped the Allies end the war early.  Hitler was his own worst enemy.    The book covers both the Eastern and Western fronts.  Military strategy is the prime focus.  The book does relate some personal stories on the last days of the Reich.  In the last days, the personal toll was heavy, and Hitler's health started to go downhill quite rapidly.  As related in the book, when Hitler died, he was 56, but medically he was closer to seventy, and the Parkinson's disease was spreading fast.  This is a nice read on the last days of the Third Reich.  There have been other books about this time period (Toland's The Last Hundred Days), but this is an above average read.
