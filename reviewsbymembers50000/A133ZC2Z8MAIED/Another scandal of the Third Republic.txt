 I am interested in the Third Republic period of France, and this book detailed another scandal from that period.  The book details the life of Therese Daurignac who married a son of the founder of the Republic.  It details how Humbert, his son Theodore, and his wife committed a fraud on the French nation by pretending to be rich when in fact they were peasants with no money.  Eventually, their scheme of borrowing money to pay other creditors collasped, and Therese and her husband were sent to prison. If there is a criticism of this book, it is the brevity of it.  132 pages cannot bring to life how thousands of people were cheated out of their money, so that Therese could live the good life.  For other books about scandals in the Third Republic, read Prisoners of Honor, The Dreyfus Affair by David Levering Lewis and The Panama Affair by Maron J. Simon.
