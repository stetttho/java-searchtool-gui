 Let me say that I believe Mr. Overy is a fine historian.  His book Why the Allies Won was a solid read for why the Allies won World War II.  I rate his present book as only an average read.  Overy details the reality of the Battle of Britain.  This is good info, if of a short duration.  The reality is that this vaulted battle was a series of short campaigns which had no regular start date.  Other pertinent information was that the British pilots outnumbered the Germans.  The British Spitfire had more crashes than the Hurricane.  Both sides (Germans and English) did not willingly target civilian targets.  Hitler even forbade terror bombing.  However collateral damage was very high.  The British always had superiority in numbers.  This is all good information for the World War II historian.  This shows how people have made myths of certain historical events, when in fact the reality is different. This is a nice little book which shows reality versus myth.  I wish it were longer and more detailed, but the book shows the reality of the Battle of Britain.
