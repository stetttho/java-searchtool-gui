 There is some good information in this book about how the Nazis managed to maintain and increase their power in Germany and the other conquered nations.  The Nazi movement was very corrupt, and their corruption of other institutions was the reason they stayed in power.  Not only did they corrupt German industrialists and clergy, but also foreign allies and local Jewish leaders.  Many people thought they could deal with the Nazis but in the process were corrupted and degraded their own morality.  I was surprised at some of the examples shown in this book.  German industrialists like the head of I.G. Farben were opposed to the Nazis.  However, the Nazis corrupted this company and in the end, Farben was employing slave labor and working in the concentration camps. This is a book about corrupted morality.  The reader should ask what he would do in similar circumstances.  Despite the nature of the topic, the authors pick and choose their subjects and themes.  There is much to learn on this topic.
