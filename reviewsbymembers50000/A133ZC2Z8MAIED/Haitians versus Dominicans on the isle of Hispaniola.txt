 I have been to both of these poor countries so I was interested in this book.  I made three separate visits to the island, twice to the Dominican Republic and once to Haiti.  They are indeed very unique and yet very similar to each other.  Wucker does a good job on both their similarities and differences.  Both had a strong traditions of dictatorial rule, along with weak democratic governments.  People in both countries are of similar ethnic background, but both try to point out their differences. Haiti is to France and Africa what the Dominican Repuplic is to Spain and Latin America.  Wucker just states they are like two cocks fighting it out.   The one problem with this book is that the author writes more about the Dominican Republic viewpoint than that of Haiti.  One has to explore Haiti to truly love it and its people.  After reading this book, I don't know if the author really got to know the Haitian people.  When she does write of Haitians, it is often those who have lived for years in the Dominican Republic.  She should have spent more time in Haiti. This is a wonderful book about a little known conflict.  For those people interested in the Caribbean, this is a great book.
