 A summary of the First World War and America's participation in the war.  I have read a number of summaries of World War I, but Bosco managed to make this interesting by making it concise and with some little known facts.  The reader can easily understand the history behind the war with an investment of two hours reading this book.  Although written for high school students, this book can be read by an adult wanting to know something about this event.  America's participation is highlighted, due to the educational nature of this book. A good quick read about World War I.
