 A nice read, and very fair minded especially concerning Germany and Austria-Hungary.  Thonson details the principle authorities who were responsible for WWI and how their actions resulted in the world getting into this conflagration.  The Germans and Austrians are of course detailed.  Then there are the French and Russians whose action also caused the war.  France did not want to be seen as causing the war, but her President Poincaire almost certainly raised the level and desire for war.  As I have stated before, the Russians and French were not babes in the wood, and Thomson shows how their actions resulted in the conflict. This is a nice read.  Unfortunately, this book is very much out of date and hard to find.  It gives a balanced view of what happened in July and August of 1914.
