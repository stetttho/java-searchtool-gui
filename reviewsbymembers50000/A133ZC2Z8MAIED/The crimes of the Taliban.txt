 I read this story about Zoya, the young Afghan woman and her story of refuge in Pakistan and trips into Afghanistan.  This is an OK story, although I prefer My Forbidden Face, another Afghan woman's story.  Zoya's comments about the Mujalideen being as bad as the Taliban has some truth.  Her resistance to these two regimes through RAWA is brave and principled.  It goes to show that Afghan society is very traditional in the sense of repressing woman throughout society.  The Soviet regime was probably the best in representing women in the society, but of course they were invaders and Zoya was not happy about their occupation of the country.  This is a pretty basic story detailing the crimes of the Mujalideen and the Taliban.  Zoya loses both parents, probably to the Mujalideen.  Then she is forced to flee and her opposition to the Taliban makes up the latter part of this book. Hers is a difficult position.  Friends in RAWA place her in a school and she becomes liberated with knowledge.  She refuses to leave her countrymen and lives in a refugee camp.  Her life is spent for the betterment of her countrymen, including women.  I like the other book better, but this is an OK read about the difficulties faced by Afghan women.
