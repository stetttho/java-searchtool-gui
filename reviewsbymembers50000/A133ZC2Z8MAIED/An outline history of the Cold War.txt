 This is an average read of the very difficult subject of the Cold War.  Roberts gives the reader an adequate summary of this difficult time period. Roberts breaks the Cold War into four stages.  They are: The European Dimension 1945-1950 Korea to Vietnam 1950-1975 The Quest for Superpower Understanding 1953-1974 Resurgence to Ending 1973-1991. These periods were overlapping.  Roberts explains them adequately.  Roberts terms some stages of the Cold War as the long peace since the superpowers tried to resolve conflicts with each other.  Towards the end, tensions rose as both superpowers tried to exert more power in different areas of the globe. The reader will get a summary knowledge of the Cold War.  The writing is academic but the book is short.
