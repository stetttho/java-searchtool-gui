 If you want a definitive account of the Battle of the Bulge, this is not the book for you.  Burgett's account is a personal view of what his unit went through.  In this account, one views the destruction and killing of war.  Friends of Don's are killed in these battles and a soldier's reaction is to continue and survive.  One wonders how soldiers continued in this environment. I read Burgett's first book Currahee, and found that this book was much more entertaining and true.  No outlandish tales as in his first book.
