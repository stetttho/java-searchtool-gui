 This book takes us from the arrival of Commodore Perry and the end of the Shogun period to the Tokyo Olympics in the history of Japan.  As Buruma emphasizes in his book, Japan has evolved from a feudal society to an industrialized democratic society.  This evolution was neither peaceful nor perfect.  Buruma describes the wars, rebellions, that were the result of this evolution.  Four wars, three emperors, numerous rebellions, and Allied Occupation and by the end of 1964, Japan is still in transition.   One of the reviewers from Japan scorned this book, but Buruma does a nice overview of Japan and its people.  Buruma reviews the present status of this country still beset with right wing politicians, corruption, and reliance on the United States.    Japan is in evolution, as most nations are.  By emphasizing these issues, perhaps the world can better understand this unique nation. This is a solid summary read of Japan.
