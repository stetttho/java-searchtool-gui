 A nice story about the decline of one of America's leading brokerage houses.  If it weren't for the arrogance of Bob Fomon, this venerable firm might still be around.  Other personalities-Rittereiser and Pierce were also rsponsible for the death of this firm.  It just goes to show that power corrupts and total power absolutely corrupts.  I wonder how many Bob Fomons are out there in the rest of the large companies of this world.  Probably quite a lot. The book details the founding of this firm by E. F. Hutton, and the subsequent leadership.  The first fifty pages are the history of the firm, with the remaining two hundred pages detailing the rule of King Fomon, and the power plays between various players in the brokerage house.  These internal power struggles ultimately weakened the firm, so that it took its eye off its customers.  Ultimately, the firm was taken over by Shearson, a subsidiary of American Express.  A nice read on the trevails of poor leadership.
