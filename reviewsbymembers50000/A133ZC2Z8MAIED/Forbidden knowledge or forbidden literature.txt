 I had a hard time with this book.  As some of the previous reviewers have noted, Shattuck seems to have a problem with where he wants to go with this book.  It would have been great if he stuck to how some things should not be known by man.  However Roger gets mucked up and first describes man's yearning for the unknown, then talks about his liberal viewpoints on nuclear weapons, and then talks about sex and violence.  This book went all over the place, and I wonder what he was trying to prove. There must be better books on this topic but I just don't know where.  This was not a great read, but the subject is important.
