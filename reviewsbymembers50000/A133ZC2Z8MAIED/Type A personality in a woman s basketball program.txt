 I enjoyed this book because Pat is definetely old school when she comes to her coaching and managing.  I think as America has become a rich country, hard driving individuals like Pat and her parents have become downgraded as more people opt for the human relations style management.  Pat proves that the hard driven type management is still very effective in motivating people to their best.  In this book, Pat describes both her personal and professional experiences and how that has changed her to the coach she is today.  Nothing beats success, and Pat's championships prove her way can make results. This book is a surprisely good read on leadership and managing.  It is applicable to both sports and business.  The personal and professional stories prove that Pat's way is still effective in today's world.
