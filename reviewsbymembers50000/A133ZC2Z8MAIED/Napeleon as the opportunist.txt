 I have read some other books about Napeleon, but this one by Johnson was by far the most negative.  In this book, Napeleon is called a number of things such as antichrist, a tin horn dictator, a totalitarian dicatator, the sponsor of the first police state.  I am not sure these all could apply to Napeleon.  However I agree with one assessment and that is Bonaparte was indeed an opportunist.   Anyone reading this book will find that historical aspects of this major figure are little written about.  What is written about is how Napoleon rose from a minor officer in the artillery to Emperor of France and controller of Europe.  All the negatives of the French regime are written about and few of the positives are emphasized.  I was astounded to see how Johnson equated Napeleon's regime to cardboard.  I don't think I would make that assessment.  It is apparent Johnson does not regard Napeleon in high regard.  A much more balanced account may have swayed me to some of Johnson's points of view, but there is none in this book.  An easy read, but don't believe everything.
