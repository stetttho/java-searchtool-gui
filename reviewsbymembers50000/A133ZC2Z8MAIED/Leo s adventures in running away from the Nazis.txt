 As the other reviewers have already stated, this is an action packed adventure of a young man fleeing the Nazis.  Leo fled from his native Vienna, to Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, France,and Switzerland.  In this book, he describes the Austrians as welcome participants in the Holocaust and not as the victims.  Austrians treat themselves as the first victims of Hitler's aggression rather than the willing helpers of Hitler.  As he fled, other nations tried to avoid Hitler's refugees.  No one welcomed the outcasts from the Hitler regime. One comment about the nature of this book.  Most of the victims did not know what was going to happen when they embarked on the train journey to the camps.  Leo states it in the narrative.  I don't think even he knew, other than the future was bleak.  It lessens the story narrative as he pictures the death that awaits these people.  This should have been told at the end. This is a great book to read.  It shows the suffering of the Jews and those who opposed Hitler.
