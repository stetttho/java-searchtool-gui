 I will not rate this book 1 or 2 stars just because it is less history and more theory, but I think some of the previous reviewers are right in disagreeing with some of the authors statements.  Fernandez-Armesto comes up with some quite interesting reasons why Latin America developed so differently than the United States and Canada.  This is less history and more theory and conjecture.  The reader should at least be open to some of these theories, because they can explain some of the reasons north and south developed so differently.  Perhaps it was economic, political, or geographical, but Fernandez-Armesto tries desperatly to point that it was not the ethnic make up of the population.  I agree with the author, but he should make that point up front, rather than dance around it. This book is an OK read.  Some of the other books in this series are more history than theory, so I was a bit put off by the subtitle of a hemispheric history, when in fact it is some theories about the inequality in the continent.  The reader should keep an open mind to these theories, since they may prove to be true.
