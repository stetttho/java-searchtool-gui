 I found this book very similar in material to Gene Smith's earlier book Maximilian and Carlotta.  I think Ridley followed the same context as Smith, and threw in a little more material on Juarez.  So, if you have read one of these books, don't read the other.   Overall, it presents the conflict between the Conservatives and Liberals and Maximilian and Juarez correctly.  It poses Maximilian as heroic and wrong headed while Juarez is portrayed as stubborn and single minded.  Both needed more analization to portray them correctly.  The book was very readable.
