 Unlike the previous reviewer, I found this book a good read for those interested in submarine life.  There were some typos in the book, but the reader could figure out what Polmar is trying to say.  This book was originally written in the sixties, and was brought up to date with other submarine accidents.  What is covered is one of the most tragic U.S. Navy accidents.  Polmar covers the short life of this nuclear submarine, and why she may have went down. By now, most people have heard about the Russian submarine Kursk and her fate.  The U.S. Navy suffered a similar tragedy in 1963 with the loss of 129 men and the U.S.S. Thresher.  What is interesting is the way Admiral Rickover (Jimmy Carter's mentor) is pictured in this book.  It seems Rickover tried to cover up for any failure of the nuclear powerplant in the Thresher.  Polmar does an alright job in making the technical data interesting.
