 This is a nice little book about what went on in the Russian Campaign.  The author served on the French General Staff and describes the inside activities of Napoleon, Ney, Eugene, and Murat and their Russian opponents.  This book describes the fire which consumed Moscow as being the result of Russian patriots setting the capital ablaze rather than let the French keep the conquered capital.  Murat is described as a couragous though foolhardy leader who led his calvary to death and destruction.  Ney is viewed as a leader who sacrificed his troops and himself for the greater good of the Grand Army.  Favorable portraits of Prince Eugene (Napoleon's stepson) is also provided.  The campaign and the resulting retreat were indeed a tragic consequence of Napoleon's grand designs.  The description of the retreat and the loss of thousands of troops is griping and is terrific reading. This is a good read for those interested in the Napoleon period.  Tolstoy researched this book when he was writing War and Peace.  The portrait of most of the French characters including Napoleon is very balanced.
