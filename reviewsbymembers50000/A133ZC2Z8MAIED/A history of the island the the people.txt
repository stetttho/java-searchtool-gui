 Out of many, one people. This is a nice little book about the history of the island and its people.  The history of the island begins with its first Indian population.  The history concludes with the election of Prime Minister Edward Seaga.  The history includes the brief Spanish period, the occupation by the British, the introduction of slavery and sugar during the 1600s and the 1700s, the British Crown Colony, and independence from 1962 to 1980.  The history includes Jamaica's interaction with the rest of the world, and Jamaica's contribution to the West. For those visiting Jamaica on a beach vacation, this is a nice little read.  Although short, it is full of good information about this country.  This book is also full of nice historical pictures.  I picked this book up in a second hand store in Jamaica, so it might be difficult to obtain a copy in Jamaica, so use Amazon to procure a copy.
