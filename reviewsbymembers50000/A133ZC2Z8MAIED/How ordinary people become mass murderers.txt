 For any people who say that genocide could not happen in their country, read Machete Season.  Even though Rwanda was not a functioning democracy with a long history, how did ordinary people become killers and destroy 800,000 people in the process. This destruction was more efficient than Nazi Germany and the result was a thirteen week bloodbath.  The author interviews a group of young Rwandian Hutus who were imprisoned as a result of their activities.  Their crime was hunting down their Rwandan Tutsi neighbors and then cutting them.  Cutting is the name for murder, but in their eyes they were just cutting something other than bananas.  After the cutting, they raped Tutsi women and stole their wealth.  These men had no doubts about what they did.  In fact, the Hutu state government forced them to participate in the murders.  They adapted to these new circumstances well.  The search for Tutsi became a hunt and the cutting was like farm work.  Most enjoyed the looted goods as a result of their killings.  This book is a fascinating perspective on how the Rwanda genocide occurred.  One has read the history, and wondered why.  This shows the inside of the mind working from the killer's perspective.  An interesting though tragic read.
