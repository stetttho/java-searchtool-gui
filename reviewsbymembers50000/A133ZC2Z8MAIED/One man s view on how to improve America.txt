 Gingrich's ideas are common sense.  Americans have to take responsibility for themselves and stop playing the part of victim.  As a victim, they ask the government for benefits because of their victimhood.  If they take responsibility, they need to strive to improve themselves through education and other methods.  That said, I don't know if I am in accord with all his principles.  Government needs to help those who either cannot or will not help themselves.  I think Gingrich equates that with the Big Brother concept of government.  If it were up to Gingrich, many people who have relied on the government for their living would be thrown out on the streets.  I don't think that is the answer either. As a moderate Republican, I don't subscribe to all Gingrich beliefs.  He is at the far right of the Republican Party and I was happy to see him replaced as the House Speaker.  I think some of his views are common sense, and some are right wing.  The tape was an average listen.
