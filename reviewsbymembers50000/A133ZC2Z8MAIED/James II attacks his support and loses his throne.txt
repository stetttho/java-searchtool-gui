 This book was written in the 1930s and is now coming back as a reprint.  With all the revisionist history floating around (Ungrateful Daughters), it is good to read something about why James II did lose his throne.  Basically James II was an inept leader who attacked his base of support (Tories) and alienated the Whigs.  When William I landed and advanced on London, James II gave up and fled.  If he would have stayed, he and his son would have ruled Great Britain with the consent of Parliament.  Trevelyan does a good job of detailing how James II lost his throne. This is an academic read.  There is little dramatic actions in this book.  It is simply an explanation of how a leader should not rule.  This is also a short read for someone looking to understand the Glorious Revolution.
