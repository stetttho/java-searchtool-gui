 Simpson was a USIA officer in Vietman during the fifties and sixties.  In this excellent personal observation of what he saw during this time period, Simpson details the drift toward U.S. intervention.  He also details the defeat of the French and their replacement by the Americans.  This is good history, as well as a good personal story of U.S. involvement.  The author does a good job of showing the antagonism between the French and the Americans.  The French was losing their empire, but still wanted the have its sphere of influence.  America was the rising power.  Its seems the French were jeleous of American power, and did all in their power to thwart it.    Also interesting is the infighting between the anti-Communist Vietnamese.  There were so many different groups fighting for a share in the power that they forgot their main enemy, the Viet Minh (or Viet Cong).  Simpson details this infighting in the stories of the coups.  They destroyed the unity of the anti-Communist groups.  This is a nice little history of American involvement prior to the Marines landing in 1965.  This book shows the drift to U.S. involvement in a war they probably couldn't have won.  A nice read.
