 This is a nice summary book of the war between the Soviet Union and Finland.  This book was written back in 1973, and the one on sale here is a reprint.  Trotter's book, A Frozen Hell is probably a better book because it gives an analysis of the war, where this book are reflections of the war from the Finish viewpoint.  However this book has merit, simply because it has recorded some of the sufferings on the Finish side, in the war with a super powver. For those people wanting a balanced point of view, go with Trotter's book.  For those who only need a brief history of this event, this is an adequate and very readable book, complete with pictures.  As one of the previous reviewers has pointed out, one of the authors is a Finn, and this is his first book, so the wording might be a little stilted.  However, I don't think it detracts from the story of a war where the Soviets may have suffered over a million casualities, while inflicting only 50,000 casualities on the Finnish population.  The Soviets bit off more than they could chew when they decided to invade Finland.
