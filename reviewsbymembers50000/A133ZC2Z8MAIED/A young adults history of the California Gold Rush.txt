 Axon gives us a short history of the California Gold Rush.  He details some brief history of the gold discovery in 1848, talks a little about the 48ers and more about the 49ers, and then moralizes in the last third of this very short book about discrimination, racism, and other aspects.  I guess Gordon feels he has to lecture his young readers about the evils of society long gone.  Well, I wanted a little more history, and not some morality lecture.   In any book, I am looking to learn something.  I could have learned more if the author kept on track.  He did not, and that is why I rated this book low.
