 Professor Parssinen has written a great read of the conspiracy by the German Army for a coup de etat against Hitler.  The stage was the Sudetenland crisis of 1938 and the German generals were against a new war.  They were hesitant against launching some thirty odd divisions against the Czechs and having to defend the Western Front with nine divisions.  If the French and British had stood their ground, the German military would have overthrown and killed Hitler.  Instead Chamberlain backed down, the Sudetenland was taken over, and six months later, the Germans completed the occupation of Czechoslovakia.  The German generals were in no mood to overthrow the government since all had gone well with Hitler.  Colonel Oster was the Abwehr second in command who organized the elements who would have overthrown Hitler. Parssinen feels the coup would have taken place.  I am not so sure Hitler would have been so easily overthrown.  At this stage, people still believed in the Nazis and Hitler.  Parssinen feels that German people were antiwar and would not have supported the government if there was an alternative.  However, the book shows the extent of the Nazi resistance in Germany. A great read.
