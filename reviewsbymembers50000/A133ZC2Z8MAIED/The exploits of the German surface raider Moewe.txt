 This is one of Hoyt's earlier works about a merchant ship equiped to sink British shipping in the Atlantic.  This ship, the Moewe (Seagull) sank British and Allied shipping during the First World War.  Her two voyages gave the German's a victory in disrupting Allied shipping.  Despite all this, the German captain Dohna-Schlodien was gallant and humane enough to rescue most of the crew members of his victims.   This is an adventure story.  Several of Hoyt's earlier works are classic reads on little heard of events.  I am surprised this book has not been reprinted.  I think there would be interest in the exploits of the German surface raiders because the odds were definitely against them.
