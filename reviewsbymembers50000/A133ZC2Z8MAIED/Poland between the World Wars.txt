 Until recently, Poland was a satelite of the Soviet Union.  Before World War One, Poland was part of three different Empires. The only time Poland was truly an independent country was between the two World Wars.  Under the leadership of Marshall Pilsudski, a large European nation was born which had been submerged for over 100 years.  As part of that emerging process, Poland fought a war with the Soviet Union and managed to stem the tide of Communist advancement in Europe.   This is a great history book.  The politics and history of Poland come alive.  During this time period, Poland was not a democracy, but an authoritarian state ruled by a benovolent leader.  Poland played a balancing act between Germany and the Soviet Union.  The National Democrats, the PPS, and Marshall Pilsudski played power politics.  This book was very complimentary to Pilsudski, portraying him as the glue that held the nation together whereas the other political parties used power to enrich themselves.   Watt is a favorite author of mine.  His books, Dare Call It Treason and The Kings Depart are two of my favorite books on World War One.  Watt does another home run with this book on interwar Poland.  For those interested in Polish history, this is a must read.  For those interested in general history, this is a great book to read about Poland.
