 Russell dispels the notion that the trials following WWII were victor's justice.  The book details the crimes the Nazis perpetrated on the people of Europe.  These crimes included genocide, incorrect treatment of POWs and civilian populations, and torture.  Russell details in this short book why the Nazis were guilty of crimes against humanity.  In one quote, Goering states how he doesn't care about the civilian populations of the conquered countries--they could die for all he cares.  Well Goering and his counterparts got their just deserts following the war.  The Nurenberg trials and others were not victor's justice.  These trials brought to justice people who led a criminal regime. This is a good read about the crimes of the Nazis.  Those who perpetrate crimes against humanity should be held accountable to the world population.
