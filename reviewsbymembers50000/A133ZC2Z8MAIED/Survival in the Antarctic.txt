 A good little read, especially for those who think they have it difficult.  I had not known of Shackelton's amazing voyage until I read this book.  Alexander certainly has done the research to draw on the what happened when the Endurance got stuck in the ice and Sir Ernest's boat journey to South Georgia island.  It is amazing to find how Shackelton led his men to their salvation dispite all the difficulties they faced with survival in the Arctic. This book is amply supplied with photographs from the journey with suitable explanations.  As stated previously, Alexander has done a great job detailing the history of the trip, along with short biographies of the key players in the expedition. The photos (all black and white) are simply great to look through.  A good read.
