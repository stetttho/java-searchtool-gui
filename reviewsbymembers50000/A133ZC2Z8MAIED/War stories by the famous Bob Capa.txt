 This is Capa's story of his World War II.  Capa was a famous photographer from the Spanish Civil War, who applied his skills in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, and France.  For a photographer, his stories are very good and enjoyable.  Like one of the previous reviewer, I have to agree that Capa does not reveal much of himself.  If you take his stories, he appears to be an alcoholic and irresponsible.  His photos though are world famous.   These stories are great to read and the book is not long.  This is good Sunday reading.
