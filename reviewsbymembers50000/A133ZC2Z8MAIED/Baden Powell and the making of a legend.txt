 There are few books on this subject and I wanted to know the legend of this famous siege and the leader of the forces in Mafeking.  For those of you who were once boy scouts, Baden Powell was the founder of the Boy Scout movement.  He was also an author of several books.  He also was a poor soldier.  However in the Anglo-Boer War, he stationed his main body of troops in the wasteland city of Mafeking and let the Boers surround the city.  Once surrounded, Baden Powell improved the morale of the city and outlasted the Boer siege by seven months. His morale building habits led the population to resist the Boer encrouchments.  After the siege, Baden Powell led a body of troops that performed poorly because of bad leadership.  He was placed in charge of the police and promoted to General. The author demonstrates in this book why Baden Powell was a poor military man.  His body of troops could have done more harm to the Boers on the northern border than being trapped in a small city.  His assistant Plumer was far more active in the war and tied down more troops.  However the British newspapers and public revered this man and he became a legend despite his poor military manuevers.  This was a satisfactory read.
