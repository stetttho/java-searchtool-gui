 I am going to disagree with the previous reviewer.  Why?  Because the book loses it theme and goes off about the evils of nuclear war, spaceships, alien civilizations, and all sorts of other wacky stuff. What happened at Tunguska in Russia during 1908 is what concerns me.  Something really destuctive exploded above ground and blew apart several hundred square miles of forest and marshland.  What I got in this book was a chapter about the evils of nuclear war.  Then the book goes off about how maybe an alien spaceship hit Tunguska.  Not any alien spaceship, but a probe.  The author then narrows it down to the star where this spaceship came from.  I thought I was reading science fiction at this point.   The reality is Tunguska was probably hit by a comet that came into the Earth's atmosphere and exploded above ground.  The author does convince the reader it was not a meteorite.  The rest about spaceships and nuclear war is so much filler which brought the book out to 200 pages.  Hopefully some author will do a better job writing a detailed book about what really did happen at Tunguska.
