 Most historians of the Eastern Front detail the big battles that were the key turning points such as Stalingrad, Leningrad, and Kursk.  Howver, most overlook Operation Bagration which occured at the same time as the Normandy landings.  Bagration freed Belarus from the Nazi occupation and cost the Germans over 300,000 soldiers.  This battle forced the Germans to retreat to the pre war borders of Poland and handed the Russians the opportunities to force the Germans onto the defensive.  This book gives the reader an overview of the battle and its later effects.  Since it is a summary short read, there is no in depth discussion but the overview is sufficient. This is a good summary read for the military historian.  The book is chock full of photos and technical details of the battle.
