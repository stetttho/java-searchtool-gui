 A nice little read, even if the author does not always understand jet aircraft or nuclear power.  This is a story of Saddam's attempts to get the bomb, and Israel's raid that denied them the bomb.  There are many characters in this book:  pilots, generals, Saddam, Begin, and Jacques Chirac.  Chirac sells the Iraquis nuclear technology which could have given Saddam the bomb.  His justification....France made a lot of money out of the deal.  Just another example of how the Europeans don't care who they sell their technology to. The book is a blow by blow story of how Israel first delayed and then plotted the attack on Iraq's nuclear reactor.  Israel used sabotage, extortion, and then assasination to delay the completion of Iraq's nuclear reactor.  Then it plotted the destruction of the reactor by an air strike.  The pilot's stories are the most interesting in this book.  This was a nice little read.
