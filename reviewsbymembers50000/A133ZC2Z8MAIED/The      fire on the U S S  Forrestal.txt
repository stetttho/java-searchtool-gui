 This is a great read, and it took me all of three days to read this story of the fire on the U.S.S. Forrestal.  I am surprised this book did not become a bigger seller than others.  Freeman does a great job of detailing the life on this carrier and the result of the fire and deaths as a result of the accidental firing of the Zuni rockets.  One gets a sense of purpose of those people who work their lives on the carriers. This book taught the value of following procedures in dangerous situations.  Those who circumvented the rules indirectly caused the firing the rocket into McCain's aircraft.  The government using old WWII ordinance also bears some of the blame.  The young crew are to be truly commended for fighting such a dangerous blaze at the risk of their lives.  Their actions saved the ship.  Freeman tells an amazing story.
