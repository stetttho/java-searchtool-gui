 Well, this book had the premise of being a very good, fascinating account of the New Madrid earthquake.  The first chapter of the book even starts out with a account of what happened.  Then it starts talking about the theory of predictions, why earthquakes happen, why this one might have happened.  It was pretty evident that two authors wrote this book.  This book goes in all sorts of directions, but the actual one in which it was supposed to go.   Unlike other books, this one was was not smooth and was hard to follow.  Even though it was a short book, it took twice as long to read as one considerably thicker but more interesting.  I also doubt it is the definitive history of this early American earthquake.
