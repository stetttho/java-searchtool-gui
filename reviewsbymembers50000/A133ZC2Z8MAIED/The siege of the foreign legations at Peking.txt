 Another simplistic story of the Boxer Rebellion in China.  Hirschfeld at least explains the Chinese reason for the rebellion and since this book is aimed at the younger reader, it is fair to both sides.  The one thing I didn't appreciate is the fictional conversations thrown into the historical writing.  This confuses the reader.  For those readers who want a short summary of the rebellion, this is an OK book, for those into more detail, look elsewhere.
