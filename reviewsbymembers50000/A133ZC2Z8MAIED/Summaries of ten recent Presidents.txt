 This is a composite book from ten different authors about ten different Presidents.  Since these are all well known authors, the writers know their subjects and boil their personalities down in twenty to thirty pages.  One cannot get more well known than David McCullough and Steven Ambrose.  The writing is great and flows well. If I have any problem, it is that some of the authors are more generous than others.  Reeves makes Kennedy look pretty low on the morality issue and Noonan inflates Reagan a little too much.  Of course, this is subjective writing, and since the authors know their subjects well, one can probably count on some bias.  All in all a great read on some of our more recent Presidents, with the exception of Clinton and Bush II.
