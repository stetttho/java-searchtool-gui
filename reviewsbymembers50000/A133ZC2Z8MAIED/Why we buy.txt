 I was wondering why I bought this tape.  Well, it was because Walgreen's had a bunch of bargain tapes prominently featured in their store, and the music playing had a subliminal message that said buy me.  Seriously, Rushkoff does a good job of detailing how people are influenced to buy a product, subscribe to a belief, or follow a messianic leader.  I think Rushkoff is suspious of all people or companies trying to sell a product.  However, in most cases, he details how Western style societies have been influenced by consumerism, and how companies have refined their selling habits to sell their services and products.  Rushkoff does not just stop at the selling of products.  He talks about why people join and stay in cults, why people follow political leaders, the effects of the worldwide web and internet on people, and pyramid schemes.  In modern marketing, as well as these, people are coerced in subscribing to alien beliefs or products.  This is why people need to understand these principles in order to avoid the damage of coercion on their person.   The book is relatively interesting.  A good book for those interested in the decision making process of the Western consumer.
