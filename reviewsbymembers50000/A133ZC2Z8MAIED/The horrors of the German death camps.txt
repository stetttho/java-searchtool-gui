 Delbo is a French Resistance person who is caught by the Germans and put in their death camps.  The last camp she served in was Auschwitz.  In this very short book she writes of the horrors of the death camps.  The writing is almost dream like (or nightmare like). One might have to read the passages twice in order to understand what she is trying to pass along. What can you say about these books.  They describe man's cruelty to his fellow man.  They all point to the suffering of those imprisoned in these camps.  Because of this, they are all good reads, and Delbo's book is no different.  Since Delbo is not Jewish, one can see that all types of people were killed off by the Nazis. Since this book is so short, a person can finish this off in two to four hours.  The perspective gained might help to prevent such suffering in the future.
