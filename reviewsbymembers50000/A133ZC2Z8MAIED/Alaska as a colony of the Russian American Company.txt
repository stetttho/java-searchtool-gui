 A good overall read of the early colonization of Alaska and the the reasons for it.  Chevigny does a good job describing the characters in the Russian American company and the difficulties is settling Russian Alaska.  Less of value is the reason why they sold the colony to the United States, since the author is judging from a latter time.  Since this book was written in the mid Sixties, some of the language may be stilted  and the text is certainly dry at time.
