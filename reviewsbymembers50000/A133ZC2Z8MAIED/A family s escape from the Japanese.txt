 This was an enjoyable and quick read.  Brookes as a boy escaped with his family from wartime Burma.  During the trek north to China, back to Burma, and then ultimately India, Brookes lost his father and saw his family become sick because of malnutrition and malaria.  However the boy became a man, and came to understand the struggle of life after seeing death every day.  This is a true story of endurance, and why people should never give up. There is both a sad and happy end to this true story.  Brookes becomes a man and raises a large family.  His childhood family is destroyed by the war.  After the war, his mother goes back to Burma with one of his brothers.  He goes to live in Great Britain.  The war basically destroyed the family he loved. This is a great read for those that need to understand the tragedy of war.
