 This book is meant as a textbook for high school and college history courses.  I thought the author did a good job detailing the main aspects of the war, and also making it exceedingly boring.  The book gives all the relevant information about the war, but it adds none of the human element in a war struggle.  The book also gives a brief biographical sketch of all the main characters in this stuggle.  Also included are all the major documents of the war and these are of interest to the historian. Few textbook writers make their material interesting to the average reader.  They dwell on the main parts of the history, and this is why I rated the book as a three star.  A more human and lively element would have made this a better book.
