 On June 10, 1944 SS troops of the German Das Reich division drove into the French town of Oradour and massacred 642 civilians.  In the past, this action was cited because of the killing of a Major Kampfe by the French resistance.  In this book, Mackness states the real reason was the French resistance ambushing a convoy of German vehicles which contained half a ton of gold.  The Germans thought the gold could have been hidden in Oradour, and that is the reason the civilians were murdered and the buildings burned. Mackness thought about writing this book as a novel, since he had no proof about the half ton of gold.  He initially was thrown into jail for trying to smuggle a small portion of this gold into Switzerland.  Therefore this book is two stories.  One about the smuggling and subsequent jail time of the author and the second about the massacre at Oradour.  He weaves between these two stories throughout the short book.  It was a good read, but this is not proven history so one should take note.
