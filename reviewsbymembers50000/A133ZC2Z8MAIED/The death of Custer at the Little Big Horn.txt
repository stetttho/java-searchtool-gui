 The previous reviewers are quite correct that this is a very short volume about the defeat of Custer at the Little Big Horn. Mari Sandoz died shortly after writing this book.  I don't diagree with some of the author's comments about the massacre of Indians at other battles and the possibility of Custer seeking the Presidency.  I think historical facts show these to be true. Sandoz shows the battle from both sides.  Since she knew some of the participants in this battle (Indians) she vividly recreates what the battle must have been like.  Recent digs at the site have concluded some soldiers did indeed flee down toward the river before they were massacred.  Custer is shown as a man seeking fame.  I think it stupid that he went into battle after dividing his command in the face of a huge number of foe.  One wonders what he was thinking of when he did this.  The pursuit of fame had to be the chief cause.  The result was the death of 265 men. A good book to read.  Some facts are debateable, but this is a quick easy read and one which presents one side of Custer.
