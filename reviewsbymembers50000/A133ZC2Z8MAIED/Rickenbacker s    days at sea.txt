 This is Captain Eddie Rickenbacker's story of his survival of life at sea for 21 days.  The founder of Eastern Airlines is indeed a remarkable person.  He survived an earlier crash outside Atlantic, became involved in audits and speeches to front line airmen, and then survived for 21 days at sea after his B-17 bomber was ditched in the Pacific.  During those 21 days, he and the airplane's crew caught fish and gulls, drank rain water, and came close to dying.  This is an inspirational story, and one wonders if Eddie was around in the 1980s and 1990s, Eastern Airlines might still be flying. This is rather a dated book.  Rickenbacker provides hope even in the bleakest times in the Pacific.  If I had to paraphrase the message in this book is to never give up hope.
