 This book covers 25 essays on life in Eastern Europe after Communism has gone to the wood pile.  I like Drakulic's sense of humor and commentary about life after Communism.  Many of these stories are about her native Croatia.  She focuses on both the excesses of both Communism and Fascism.  Each essay would require its own commentary, but here is my general impression. It will take many years for Eastern Europeans to overcome the legacy of the Communist era.  During this time, a market economy will be slow to develop, and the social consequences will be great.  Older people will adapt the least and be the most affected. Democracy will also be slow to develop, as can be seen in her Croatia.  Croatia was until recently ruled by Tudjman who was a Communist General in the Yugoslav Army. Tudjman controlled Croatia even though it was suppossed to be a democratic state.  He was allied with some of the Fascists who created a Croatian state in World War II.  A strange combination, but one which shows the nationalism controlling Eastern Europe.  Monarchy is also a possibility in this region. The slow prospect of reform in all the region.  Society has been slow to cast off the restraints of the old system.  People still rever the old authorities, when they should adopt new systems and leaders. Drakulic poses all these questions to the reader.  I'm not sure all are relevant, but it makes good reading.
