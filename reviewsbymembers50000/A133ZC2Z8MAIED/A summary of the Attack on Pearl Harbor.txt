 This is a nice little picture book with an accompanying summary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Plenty of pictures and illustrations of the battle itself show the history of this great attack.  The author describes both the Japanese and American point of views prior to the attack.  Then a general description of the battle itself and the resulting outcome.  There is not many personal stories in this book, just the basics of the attack itself.  Lots of information in this thin book. This is an average read.  I like a book full of personal stories along with the history to become interested in the book.  This is an analtical perspective of the attack and is more focused toward the military historian.  A good perspective of the battle.
