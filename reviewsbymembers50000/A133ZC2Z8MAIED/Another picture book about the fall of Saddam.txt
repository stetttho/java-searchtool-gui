 More great pictures about the 2003 War in Iraq and the fall of Saddam Hussein.  As in the Time book about the same campaign, there are some great pictures in this book.  On the writing side, there is little meat in this book and for one to better understand this conflict, they need to read elsewhere.  However the pictures are great and one will get a general idea on why the war was waged.  Some of the pictures in this book are graphic in nature.  It would probably not be wise to leave this book around young children.  Those pictures just prove to everybody that war is hell.
