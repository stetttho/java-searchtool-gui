 I have read the other reviewers and I have to agree this is a great read for the young adult and for that matter everybody else.  Murphy does not get bogged down in great details but simply tells the story from the perspective of a handful of individuals.  Along with this, the author provides numerous illistrations and maps detailing the progress of the fire from its origin at O'Leary's barn.  The writing is smooth and gives urgency to read just a few more pages.  This is the best type of writing to urge younger people to read. This is a great little book for readers of all ages.  The author focuses on the young adult as an audience, but his writing style is better than most other authors vying for a more sophisticated reader.
