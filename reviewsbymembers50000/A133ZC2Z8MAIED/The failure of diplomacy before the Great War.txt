 Jannen's book is the book a reader should review/consume prior to reading Tuchman's The Guns of August.  As Jannen rightly describes, in 1914, Europe was full of lions.  Diplomacy was the field of leisurely aristocrats.  Jannen's story begins with the assassination of Austrian Archduke Ferdinand on June 28, 1914.  As Jannen relates, the Serbian government had a BLACK HAND influence in the assassination of the Archduke.  From there begins the game of contests, first between Serbia and Austria Hungary, then between Germany and Russia, and finally between Germany and France/Great Britain.  As each succesive days ticks down in July, 1914, the diplomats/politicians rachet up the stakes with each other until war was the only possibility.  When the war finally ended 4+ years later, all the initial participants wondered how war came upon their nation. I never knew that the history of diplomacy could be so page turning.  Jannen's book should be a requirement for diplomats/foreign service personnel.  The world might be a different place if not for the Lions of July, 1914.
