 This is a better book than her book on Siberia.  In this book, Ms. Reid makes the case that Ukraine is indeed the borderland of Asia and Europe.  To the east, is the ancient and powerful country of Russia, and to the west, former foes in Germany and Poland.  The people of Ukraine were never a really distinct culture aside from the Russians.  This started to change in the early 1800s when authors, artists, and historians started to document their own culture.  When the Western Ukraine was joined with the Eastern Ukraine after WWII, Ukraine was a large part of the Soviet Union.  With the breakup of the Soviet Union, this country became the largest country in Europe.    The problem is:  To whom does this country lean to.  Russia is militarily powerful in the East, but the Western European countries are more economically powerful.  There lies the problem.  Ukrainian politicians will be arguing this for years to come.  Ms. Reid details the paradox this country is in.  She shows the different attitudes of the country east, west, south, and north. It will be interesting if Ukraine survives as a nation in the next twenty years.  This country could become a part of a new Russian empire.
