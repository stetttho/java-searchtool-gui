 I read this book in the seventies, and I just reread it.  Prange's book may have a lot more detail, but for a quick and easy read about this historic event, read Lord's book.  He is a master at presentation, not only on this book, but his two on the Titanic.  The individuals shines through in his book, and it is most interesting to see how they react to the Japanese attack.  I was especially interested in the Japanese suicide submarines attempt in the attack.
