 First off, the authors are from the liberal establishment, so there view is the U.S.A. was wrong to bring down the government of Guatemala in 1953-1954.  Even though I believe most of the story, they did not write an objective analysis. The U.S. Government viewed the Arbenz government as tolerating Communists in the McCarthy era, along with nationalizing certain land held by the United Fruit company based in Boston.  These two conflicts resulted in the U.S. government authorizing the overthrow of the Arbenz government and the installation of the  Castillo Armas government.  Bitter fruit is a play on words due to the involvement of the United Fruit government. As stated, I think what the U.S. government did was wrong, but I view this book as not being completely objective.  Communists were involved in the government, and Guatemala was like a magnet to Communists in the 1950s.  See Anderson's book on Che Guevarra to note that there were not just a few here.  I think the authors overlook this, and view Eisenhower and the Dulles brothers as too concerned for United Fruit. The book was well written and short enough to read in one or two days.  The book did a good job portraying the actors in this drama, along with the environment in which they operated in.
