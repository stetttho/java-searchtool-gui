 Benevolent Assimilation is McKinley's phrase for the civilizing mission of America in the Philippines.  Miller makes a good case that the Filipinos neither needed civilizing or Christianizing since they had both.  What America really wanted was a colonial empire to establish itself as a great power.  McKinley did not know what he wanted, but people made him believe in the civilizing mission of the U.S. government. What Miller demonstrates in this book is that the Philippines wanted independence and not American government.  The revolt which followed the Spanish American War was long and devastated the islands.  Thousands lost their lives, and American troops showed no mercy in putting down the revolt.  The revolt lasted for over three years, and cost the U.S. much in men and treasure. America won, but lost seventy years later in Vietnam.
