 For those of you who don't know the word, this is the German word for cruiser warfare.  In World War I, Germany stationed many cruisers around the world to support its worldwide set of colonies.  The largest of these forces was the German East Asiatic Fleet with a set of two heavy cruisers and three light crusiers.  With the subtraction of the Emden and the addition of the Dresden, this fleet waged war on the British in both the Pacific and Atlantic.  The fleet  destroyed two British cruisers off Colonel and was itself destroyed off of the Falkland Islands.  This happened in the early stages of the World War.  This book tells of the trevails and exploits of the German East Asiatic Squadron. Hoyt's books are always interesting, even though he has written over 80 of them.  There is no groud breaking academic material in this or his other books, just a solid story of man against the elements. A nice little read of a forgotten element of World War I.
