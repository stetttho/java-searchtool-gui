 I think Barber does a good job detailing the rule of the Sultans.  In the introduction, Barber states his primary interest is detailing the rule of the Sultans (including the Young Turks and Ataturk) after the first ten Sultans.  Those that followed the ten (with the exception of Ataturk) brought the Empire down through their weak rule and disastrious decisions.  Barber uses many sources (most Western) for his story of the Ottoman Empire.  I enjoyed this book because the author does a good job of making the material interesting.  I also read the author's book about the Hungarian Revolution and found it a worthwhile read also. I did not disagree much with the author.  Barber threw in several references to some of the Sultans preferences for homosexuality, and I think this interfered with the story.  Overall, a good read on the Sick Man of Europe.
