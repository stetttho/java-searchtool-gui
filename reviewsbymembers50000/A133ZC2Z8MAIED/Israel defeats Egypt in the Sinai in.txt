 Marshall is an Army historian who has written several good books about America's battles in WWI and Korea.  In this book, he writes about Israel's small army taking on the Egyptians during the Suez crisis.  The Israeli Army manages to take over the Sinai from the Egyptians.  In the book, a heroic Ariel Sharon makes his appearance in one of the central battles for control of the Sinai.  All of the battles are covered in this 100 hour war.  Marshall details the tactics the Israeli Army used in defeating the Egyptians.  Also covered is how the Israeli Army is made up, the training required, and the role of women. What is not covered in this book is the Egyptian perspective, and what the effects of the war were.  This angle was not covered, and one wonders what the reader is missing from this perspective.  I have read more thrilling combat history than that covered in this book.
