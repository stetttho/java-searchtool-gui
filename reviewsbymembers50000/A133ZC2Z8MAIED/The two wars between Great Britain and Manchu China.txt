 This is an OK read and the writing flows easily, but I have a problem with this book.  Jack Beeching wrote an 1980's title called the The Chinese Opium Wars, and Travis and Hanes quote this extensively.  Since I have read Beeching's book and rated it 5 stars, why write another book basically detailing the same story.  I felt I was reading the same thing.  This is a good book, but Beeching's book is better and the original is still on sale, even on Amazon.  So readers, go with the original.  This book is good, but Beeching's book has more detail.  I enjoyed this book, and its more pro Chinese positions that the authors adopted. The book details the two wars fought between Great Britain and China in the nineteenth century.  The war was extensively over the drug trade in China.  Great Britain imported quite a lot of tea and silk from China losing much silver in the process.  As a means of equalizing the trade, Great Britain and certain wealthy traders started exporting opium from British India to China.  The result was a deterioration in the Chinese population, corruption in the Manchu court, and more silver flowing from China to Great Britain.  The two wars were fought to open up more trade to China, including that of opium.  China was opposed to this, and the wars resulted.  This was a grave injustice to China, imposed by the British. It also details the loss to the world of the Chinese Summer Palace, which the British burned in the war. The book reviews these two wars.
