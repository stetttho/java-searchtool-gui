 Hoyt states at the beginning of this book that there are serveral good books about Goering and that this book was about the Luftwaffe.  Then he details the life of Goering and his role in the Air Service.  This is more a book about Goering, than it is a book about the Luftwaffe.  That stated, it is a good introductary text on Goering and his Luftwaffe. I like Hoyt's writing, but this book was only an average read.  The subject is not covered in detail.  Hoyt covers the main subjects: Goering's subservience to Hitler, his promises, the poor leadership of Udet and Kesslering, the lack of long range bombers, etc.  I learned a few things from this book.  The reason why Sweden was not invaded had a lot to do with Goering's promises to that country.  There are other interesting tidbits of info in this book.  However, this book does not cover this subject in detail.  Otherwise, an average read.
