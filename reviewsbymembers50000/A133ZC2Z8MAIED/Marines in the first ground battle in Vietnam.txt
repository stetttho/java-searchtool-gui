 I am not sure what the other reviewers were reading, but this book was not that interesting.  I could even have rated it lower. The material for the book was the first Marine campaign in the war called Operation Satellite.  A clerk made a typo and renamed it Operation Starlite.  Regardless of the name, the setting was close to the DaNang military airport.  The Marines thought that the VC were resting a large troop of soldiers to launch at the airport.  In fact, the VC regiment was resting and regrouping and was not going to attack the American airport.  Through a series of air strikes, helo and naval landings--the Americans fought a regiment of Viet Cong and killed 600 at a cost of 54 of their own soldiers.  The book goes through the story of the battle and what happened.  I don't particularly care what segment (squad, etc) went what way, what they used for weapons, etc.  A large part of the book describes this and the book has no flow and doesn't excite the reader to pursue further.  I did, and found much the same throughout the book.  Also, the book is generally pro-VC and makes no mention what some of the VC did to their fellow countrymen.  This was a tough read at only 200 pages.    For those interested in battles and plotting them on the map, this book may interest you.  For those who lost family, this may also be of interest.  For the great majortiy of lay readers, there are better Vietnam stories elsewhere.
