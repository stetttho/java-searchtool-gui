 Swofford is a scout/sniper in the Marine Corps and Jarhead is the book of his experiences during the First Gulf War.  Swofford is one of those people who looked at the Marine Corps as a rite of passage only to discover upon entry that he made a bad mistake.  Then he joins an elite formation of the Marine Corps called the scout/snipers never figuring he would go into battle.  Then Iraq invades Kuwait and the Marines are sent to the Persian Gulf.  His tale encompasses much of the time spent waiting in the desert for the war, and then the 100 hours of combat in Kuwait.  After the war, his best buddie is drilled out of the Corps and dies in a tragic car accident.  This is one person's view of his battle in the Marine Corps and his experiences in a short war.  The book flowed easily, and is a good solid read.  Swofford tells it like it is.
