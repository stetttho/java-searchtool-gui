 Hats off to the authors for this very authoritative book about Enron.  How did a Fortune 500 company implode into bankruptcy.  Simple, poor managers did not oversee their direct reports (Lay, Rice, Skilling, and Mark).  The company CFO was virtually printing money by moving dogs to special accounting entities (SPEs) and paying his own company to later sell them back to Enron.  The top managers did not consentrate on managing, but rather focused on deal making and doing mark to market accounting, which was very unpredictable.  Profits were booked, but most were never realized.  As time went on, these deals became very unprofitable with the result of the company having to rely on funny money provided by CFO Fastrow.  This is a great book for those who think Wall Street always values a company correctly.  The company was perceived as innovative, but in reality the  managers just hood winked the average investor in believing their stories.  Investor beware. A very worthwhile read.
