 The title is a little bit of a misnomer.  One gets the idea you will be reading a story of conspiracy against the German dictator by German army officers.  What one gets is the story of German army officers misleading Hitler and letting the Allies win at the Normandy invasion.  Even this is not really proved.  The author footnotes many authors that have proven false themselves.  An author he quotes even wrote a book about Hitler purporting him to be alive in South America.  Johnson gives a lot of attention to Canaris, as the master of this conspiracy.  Most don't know what this shadowy figure gave in the resistance movement.  There are a lot of theories but very little actual proof.  This book is unfounded in many things on the Normandy invasion. This book gives a lot of trivial facts about the Normandy invasion, but little in the way of proof of what the author alleged happened.  Not a difficult book, but the reader must understand that what is written is not always true.
