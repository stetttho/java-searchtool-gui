 First, I commend the author for writing a book about a little explored topic.  Many books tell of the land warfare in Korea, but few detail the air battles involving Mig 15s and Sabrejets F-86s.  This book attempts to do this, and I think suceeds in showing the violence of the air war.  The author breaks his book into chapters detailing the exploits of individuals waging this battle.  Unfornatunately, it tries to cover too much in a very short book.  One gets a good sense of the first year of the air battles, but nothing of the last two years.  This is a good, though average read.  The material covered is unique.  I just think the author tried to be too broad in his historical approach and personal stories, and didn't do either very well.  An average read about a little written part of the Korean War.
