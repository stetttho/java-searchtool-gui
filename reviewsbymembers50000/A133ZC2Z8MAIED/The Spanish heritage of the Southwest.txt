 This is the second Marrin book I have read.  This author does a good job summarizing the important aspects of this history.  Along the way, he brings some interesting stories into the overall historical summation.  I like his writing style as it can be understood by a teenager or an adult.  The overall message in this book was how the Southwest was first lost by the Spaniards, then the Mexicans, and won by the United States.  The Southwest is defined as Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and California. As mentioned, Marrin always brings interesting stories into his narration.  You find out the origin of Texas, how Ps and Qs became a phrase, Taylor's reaction to a self important Lietenant, and others.  These stories liven up the historical summation.  They are a joy to read. This is a good read for both teenagers and adults.  Although the history is not covered in depth, it gives the reader a base from where to go.
