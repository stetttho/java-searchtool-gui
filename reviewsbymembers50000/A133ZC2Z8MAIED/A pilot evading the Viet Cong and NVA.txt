 This is a nice little adventure story.  It is about a pilot who was shot down over Northern South Vietnam during the NVA invasion of 1972.  Gene Hambleton was a 53 year old navigator for an electronics aircraft.  When he landed, he was smack dab in the middle of a huge concentration of NVA troops.  One survelliance airplane and a rescue copter were shot down trying to retrieve him.  During the course of his two week ordeal, he managed to evade capture even though he had little food and water.  His story is an inspiration for those who had to deal with hardships.  His rescue involved an imaginary golf course so that he could work through the enemy soldiers surrounding him.  This is a nice little read, even though at times the writing sounds a little corny.  I read this in less than a day.  Gene Hambleton was a hero.  I remember the movie starring Gene Hackman, and wish I could view that again and how it relates to the book.
