 Oh the wonders of free trade.  The Americans grow King Cotton with slaves.  They then export it to Manchester to be made into textiles.  These textiles are produced with child labor.  These textiles are then exported to India, where they wipe out the local clothes trade.  The Indians then discover a great crop that has great potential--opium.  The only problem with opium is that it is addictive and eventually kills those using it.  The British want products from China such as tea and silk.  The Chinese desire no Western made goods, so the British introduce opium.  The Chinese government under the detested Manchu rulers want no part of opium, so the British fight two wars to open China up to free trade, including opium.  They seize an island and part of a peninsula to protect the merchant houses that deal in this drug.  They name this Hong Kong.  Other grim business includes the coolie trade (similar to slavery, but only for long periods of time), and the Chinese version of Christianity--the Taipings.  The French and the Americans are also involved in the opium and coolie trade. Beeching does a good job of detailing how the British and to a lesser extent the Americans were not always so noble in their dealings with Third World people.  As detailed above, we exploited their economy, made off with millions of coolies, made others opium addicts, and burned one of their prized monuments--the Summer Palace (looting it in the process).  The men that did this thought the Chinese were the barbarians.  I think Beeching was fair to both sides.  I liked his reference section in which he listed his sources, and then summarized what the opinion was--pro British, pro Chinese.  An excellent work.
