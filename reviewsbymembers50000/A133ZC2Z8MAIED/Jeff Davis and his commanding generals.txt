 Why did the South lose the war?  Well, Jefferson Davis interfered with the role his commanding generals played in their respective theaters.  Davis enjoyed a good relationship with Robert E. Lee but less desireable relationships with Johnson and Bragg.  The Western commanders and the Army of Tennessee were a less dangerous foe to the Union forces.   In this book of essays from different authors, Davis's relationship with such generals as Johnson, Bragg, Hood, Lee, and others are portrayed. His interference in their commands made the difference in the West.  Lee was more of a diplomat and managed to cope and modify Davis's demands for the Army of Northern Virginia.  Also portrayed is a unique essay on how the wives of these Generals also had an effect on the war.  Jeff Davis was a poor commander, and most of his Generals (with the exception of Lee) failures.  Lincoln was the better Commander in Chief and that is one of the reasons he won the war. A good read about the command function of the leader of a nation. This book stirs your interest in why the South lost and the North won.
