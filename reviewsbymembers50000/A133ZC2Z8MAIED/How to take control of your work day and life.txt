 Some excellent advice on how to improve your work life by placing priorities on your job tasks, and working on only the most pressing and important.  These tapes are also chock full of advice on how to control your socializing, and placing priorities on family priorities.  It is not about working harder, but working smarter.  I like one idea which Dick places before everybody and that is that nobody can accomplish all they seek to do.  Prioritization places you in a position of working on those that need to be done, not on those that are the least important.  Another gem was never working overtime on Quandrant Three and Four activities, it just isn't worth it.  Lohr states using these techniques will give the individual three weeks worth of extra time in a year for work activites which is a great reward for us busy managers. I have already started using these techniques and I believe Dick is right when he says it will increase your business effectiveness.  I think this is a great listen.
