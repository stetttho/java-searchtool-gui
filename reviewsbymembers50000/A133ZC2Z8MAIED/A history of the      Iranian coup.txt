 I like Kinzer as an author.  I have read his Turkey and Guatemala books, and found them to be objective.  This book about the 1953 Iranian coup is also an enjoyable read.  Kinzer tries to show both the Iranian, British, and American positions and what the result was.  The summation jumps to conclusions when it states this coup as the reason for the terrorism in today's Middle East.  The coup certainly fueled the terrorism, but it is not the total reason as other factors play into this. Kinzer does to this coup, what he and another author wrote about the 1954 Guatemala coup (Bitter Fruit).  Corporate interests along with those of the British brought the CIA into overthrowing a legitimate government.  Who were those corporate interests--the Anglo Iranian Oil Company, better known today as British Petroleum.  Anglo Iranian poorly treated the Iranian workers and gave little of the profit to the Iranian government.  They actually argued that Iran's oil was the property of their company.  What arrogance?  The Eisenhower administration defends the British and overthrows Mossadegh because of this. This is a good read.  The reader should draw his own conclusions about today's Middle East.
