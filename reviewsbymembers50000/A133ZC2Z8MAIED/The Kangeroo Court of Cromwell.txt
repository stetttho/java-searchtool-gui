 Wedgewood does a fine job of detailing the trial and execution of King Charles I.  Wedgewood does not play any favorites.  He shows both sides and their positive and negative behavior.  King Charles was evasive for years on yielding any of his authority and when the radicals seized power, they distrusted him.  Oliver Cromwell was a zealot and believed he was ordained by God to deliver a just punishment on a King who waged war on his own people.  The result was a conflict where one had to die.  King Charles led a futile defense (or lack of) in his trial.  The trial itself was a farce, since there was no law for it and the outcome was determined.  Charles put up a good show and walked calmly to his death. This is a nice short read on the trial and execution of King Charles.  It is totally unbiased and shows both sides for what they were.  A nice touch on this book was the people who condemned King Charles.  When they themselves were tried eleven years later, some were not as brave as the King was in walking to their death.
