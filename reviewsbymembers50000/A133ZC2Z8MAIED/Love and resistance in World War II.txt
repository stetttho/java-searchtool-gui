 The author is the daughter of two French resistance figures of World War II.  Her father was a French naval captain who divorced at mid age and married a young Polish Jew living in Paris.  When the French gave up and signed an armistice, this captain wanted to fight on and joined the Resistance.  Rather than escaping to London where he could have served in the Free French Navy as a high officer, he serves as a resistance figure and climbs to the head of a cell.  He is then tortured and shot with his wife just before the liberation of much of France.  It is a sad tale. This is a short book, and as the previous reviewer notes, makes these heroes come to light with all their positive and negative characteristics.  I feel I was reading something very personal when I read this book.  Since the original book was in French, perhaps the translator did not do a great job in the translation.  This is why I rated it only three stars.  Also, a more detailed description of the aftermath could have been done describing how the daughter was adopted by her uncle and what happened to the Leitner family children.
