 I like this book, although I disagree with some of the politics and attitudes of the author.  His wit and story telling give this book much of its appeal.  The one thing that is not good about this book is the short focus on the Aral Sea.  The sea and the tragedy of its evaporation should be one of concern for the whole world. The one thing that I dislike about this book is its condescending attitude toward the natives.  Even Tom's Peace Corps family is savaged by his wit.  This must have been a stab in the back to them if they ever read his book.  I appreciated his wit, but some other readers might not.   The book flows amazingly well.  It took me some time to read this book, but I liked the stories of his concerning Bokhara and the other cities.  After reading some of the other reviews, I was a little concerned about his sources.  However, this is a great read from a little known author.  I rate him better than Robert Kaplan.
