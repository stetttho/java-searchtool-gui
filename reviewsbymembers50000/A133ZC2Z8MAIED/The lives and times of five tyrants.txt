 Myerson does an alright job in detailing the bloody regimes of five tyrants.  How does he pick these five top contenders, he does not tell.  Since he cannot dwell on either of these five in great detail, the reader learns only the rudiments of each of these five leading contenders (Nero, Ivan the Terrible, Hitler, Stalin, and Saddam Hussein).  As a previous reviewer has already noted, some of the aspects of Hitler's life is open to contention, so one cannot believe all of this story.  Since Myerson does not detail any of his sources, one wonders where he received all the details. This is an easy read.  If one wants to learn any detail of any of these five dictators, one must read elsewhere.  As I said, this is a good summary of their lives, but don't believe everything you read.
