 This seventies book is about the campaign in Malaya which concluded with the successful surrender of the fortress Singapore to Japanese forces in February, 1942.  The campaign to take Thailand, Malaya, and Singapore took exactly seventy days. Falk is very detailed in his writing about what happened to cause the loss of the fortress Singapore.  In one of the chapters of the book, he details the loss of the British Force Z (Repulse and Prince of Wales). Falk does a good job of telling us why the fortress was weak.  Its defenses pointed toward the sea, and not the landward side of Johore.  Also the state of the British Empire waging a war against both Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, weakened the country to the point where inadequate defensive forces were provided to Singapore.  The result was a disasterous defeat of the British, with many of the soldiers spending years in prison building a railroad (The Bridge over the River Kwai).  Falk spent too much time on detailing what units did what, and not descibing what the effect of the defeat had on World War II.  Otherwise a good read on a great defeat of the British Empire by the Japanese Empire.
