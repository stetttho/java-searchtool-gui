 If you lived through the seventies and eighties, one thing which was constant was the Lebanese Civil War.  In this war, endless fractions paired off against each other destroying a country so throughly that it now only coming out of this dark period.  There was the war between the Shiites and Sunnis, the war between the Druze and other faiths, the inter Christian clan war. Throw in the Israelis and Palestinians, and there were plenty of enemies in this war. The author Mackey examines the country and the various factions and tries to make some sense of how this war came about.  Her sub title is indeed her belief that Lebanon was dying.  When even the Red Cross pulled out of Lebanon, many in the West simply gave up on this country. Mackey does a good job of detailing a little bit of the history of the country and why the various factions could not live together.  She puts into her perspective that Lebanon was not going to survive the Civil War.  It has, first under Syrian tutelage, and now as a completely independent country.
