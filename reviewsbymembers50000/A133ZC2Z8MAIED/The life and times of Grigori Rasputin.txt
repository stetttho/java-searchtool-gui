 The title says it all and De Jonge delves not only into the biography of his subject, but also the times that spawned this unique creature.  If one was raised in the Western tradition, then the spiritualism of the East is often difficult to understand. In this book the author gives us an idea of why someone like Rasputin could rise to the level he did and influence the very level of command he did.  I think other biographies of Rasputin are not on the level of this one because they focus strictly on the scandalous nature of Rasputin, and not the culture that created it. After reading the author's work on the Weimar Republic, I was a little disappointed.  This book is five star all the way.  Not only is it easy to read, but the author researched his subject for many years.  It may not be the ultimate text on Rasputin, but is definitely the most readable and understandable.
