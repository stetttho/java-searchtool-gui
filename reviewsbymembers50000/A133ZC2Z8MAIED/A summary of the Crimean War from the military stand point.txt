 Blake's book is a good overview of the war.  Where other books have related the exploits of the Light Brigade or the heroism of Forence Nightengale, this book deals strictly with the military progress of the war.  Campaigns also covered were those in Asia Minor and the Baltic Sea.  Blake's book is also well illustrated with an overview of the ground, so one can visualize what the soldiers had to go through in order to accomplish the battlefield objectives. With the battles in mind, I only rated this four stars because some of the writing is rather dry.  In one chapter, Blakes gives the viewpoint from both the Russian and Allies standpoint.  Rather than help the reader, I think this confused those trying to understand the battle.  Overall a good summary of the war.
