 This is one of those nice picture books with the summary of the history of Russia at the time of Napeleon's Invasion in 1812.  The summary includes a short history of the country up to the time of these wars.  Special focus on Alexander I as the Tsar of all Russia is also included in this book.  Tolstoy's book is the central theme in this book.  Since War and Peace took place in this period, Palmer discribes the actual Russia of this time. A person can read this book in one to two days.  For those people who are interested in Czarist Russia, this is nice book describing the pre industrial Russia of Catherine II, Paul I, and Alexander I.  This book does not delve into Russian politics or society too much, so a reader interested in those subjects would need to look elsewhere.
