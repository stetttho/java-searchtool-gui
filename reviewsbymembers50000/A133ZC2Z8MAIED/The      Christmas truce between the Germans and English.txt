 I give credit to Professor Weintraub for writing about a generally unknown subject of World War I.  The most references were from soldier letters and newspaper articles, so Weintraub had to dig for this material.  There are few other books on the subject. This is a short book, but it drags at times, especially in circumstances that seem repetitive.  The imformation about the Christmas trees, soccer, and gifts given to the troops was good. Not much material given on circumstances with other Allied troops.
