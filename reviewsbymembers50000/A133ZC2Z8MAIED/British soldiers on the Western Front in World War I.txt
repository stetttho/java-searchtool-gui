 A scholarly analysis of how British soldiers lived on the Western Front.  Winter explains all the aspects of the soldier's lives such as the class background, officers, education, weapons, life in the trench and back area, and the aftermath for these soldiers.  The reader is meant to ponder what this war meant, but it was hell. Winter limited his perspective to the British soldier, so one wonders how the German, Austrian, French, and Russian soldiers lived in comparison with the British.  It would have been a nice chapter for a comparison.  However Winter does a good job explaining all aspects of the British soldier's life.   A good read of a tragic war.  Winter gives both a soldier's perspective along with a scholarly analysis of the British soldier.  This book will give the reader something to think about.
