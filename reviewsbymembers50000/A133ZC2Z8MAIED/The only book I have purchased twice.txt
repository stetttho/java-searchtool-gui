 This is a great book.  In the eighties, when this came out in paperback, I purchased it and read it in less than a week.  I looked for my old copy, couldn't find it and then recently purchased a hard cover copy of this book again.  It is the same enjoyable read it was in the eighties.  For those looking for an enjoyable read, this book is it.  The movie pales in comparison to the actual book, since many of the most humorous stories are left out of the movie.  One example is the bank deposit box being broken, and please deposit your money with the fake security guard.  What a laugh.  This should have been put in the movie. Abagnale is a true con and this book is so well written.  For a true adventure story that flows smooth, this is a great book.  I recommend this book--Five plus stars.
