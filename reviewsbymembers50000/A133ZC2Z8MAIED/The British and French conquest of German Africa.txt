 A great and interesting read about how the Allies conquered Togo, Kameroons, South West Africa, and East Africa.  The Germans started World War I with four colonies in Africa, and short campaigns in three of them resulted in their division between the French and British.  In German East Africa, the battle was long and hard.  A German cruiser was stranded here, and the Allies had to find and destroy it.  The German military commander Lettow-Vorbeck waged a guerilla campaign against the French, British, Belgian, and Portuguese for all four years of the war.  The story of the African Queen also maks its appearance in German East Afria.  This book is the definitive account of the First World War in Africa.
