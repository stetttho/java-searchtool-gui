 If there are any doubters about the evils of slavery, read this book.  I have heard it said by some white Southerners that slavery benefited the black population, and furthermore blacks were better off in the United States than in Africa.  Slavery was evil and this book proves it. Douglass points out how slaveholders killed and mutilated their own slaves, and nobody did anything about it.  When a slave outlived his/her usefulness, the slaveholder often cast them off, so they did not have to feed and clothe these slaves.  Slave families were often broken up for the benefit of the slaveholder.  Wives and husbands were separated.  Slaves worked long hard days and then had to turn over their pay to their slaveholder.  If slaves tried to educate themselves, the slaveholders would break up their classes and then punish those seeking the education.  Same with those seeking comfort from the Holy Bible.  Those slaves were punished.   The question was did slavery benefit the black slave population of the South.  The answer is a resounding NO.  Douglass does a good job of detailing the hell of slavery.
