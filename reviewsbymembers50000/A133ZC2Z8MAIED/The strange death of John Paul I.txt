 This is a strange book.  The title states a hypothesis that has not been proven.  What this book tries to do is prove that Albino Luciano (Pope John Paul I) was murdered.  Certainly there are strange happenings between the time of the death and the discovery of the body.  The author narrows the field down to six candidates who may have committed this outrage.  This book is a conspiracy book.  If one were to believe all the material in this book, one might as well believe there was a second gunman on the grassy knoll. Stranger still, three of the possible killers were Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church.  Possible maybe, probably not. All that being said, the author has shed some valuable light on the inner workings of the Vatican.  Corruption certainly exists in the Catholic Church, and the book points that out.  I have doubts whether people murdered John Paul I.  The book also shows the pious nature of John Paul I.  The world certainly lost someone that could have helped mankind.  The one aspect this book really nails is the funny circumstances of the death of this holy man.  Why embalm a man who just died?  Why not do an autopsy?  How could a perfectly healthy man just die of heart disease, especially since all signs pointed he did not have heart disease?  These things along with the way the Vatican authorities handled these circumstances, points to something different happening to John Paul I.  The author cannot prove someone murdered John Paul I, but he certainly proves something was rotten in Vatican City on September 29, 1978. This is an interesting read.  The reader should be cautioned that some of this book might not be true.  However the author raises good questions about the death of John Paul I.
