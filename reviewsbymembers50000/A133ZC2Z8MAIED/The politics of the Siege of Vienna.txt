 An interesting book about the Siege of Vienna and how the Turks almost managed to change the course of history.  The Ottoman Empire was a powerful Empire in the world and made an attempt to dominant the life of Central and Eastern Europe.  On September 11-13, 1683, Poles, Austrians, and Germans routed them on the outskirts of Vienna.  After the battle, the Turk Empire became the Sick Man of Europe.  The Turks and Islam came very close to upsetting the balance of power in Europe.  A few more days of siege may have forced Vienna to surrender. Stoye does a good job of showing the politics of how this siege and the resulting battle took place.  Louise XIV of France was the mortal enemy of the Hapsburg and Spanish Empire.  His efforts helped the Turks make a decision on the showdown with the Hapsburgs.  Turkish court politics as well as John III's position in Poland are also discussed.  The resulting combination of Hapsburg, Saxon, Bavarian, and Poles in confronting the Turks is also reviewed throughly.  The result was the successful Allied effort in confronting the Turks. As one of the reviewers has already mentioned, only two of the nine chapters dealt with the siege and battle.  The rest was the history of the politics of this conflict.  The first part of the book drags, but I managed to learn a few things about this famous conflict.  This book is not for the beginning historian.
