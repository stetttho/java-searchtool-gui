 MacPherson has rated this book as being one of the better summary histories of the Civil War.  I have to agree.  I learned a lot reading this short history of the Civil War.  These two British authors describe well what in essence was the dividing point between the North and South and the nature of the battles. The book is also loaded with great pictures and illustrations of this era.  All in all, a nice summary of this war which cost the American nation 600,000 people.  There have been many books written about this conflict, and I have read a number of them.  This is one of the better concise histories of the war.
