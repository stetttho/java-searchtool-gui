 A nice picture book that has a lot of information contained in its 154 pages.  Time examines the longest day by going into detail about what happened in the 24 hours that saved the world.  This book also examines different aspects of the battle itself such as the engineering, medical, journalist parts.  For many, the battle itself was the high point, but beyond that were the planning and engineering that made the victory possible.  This book also points out the command system of the Allies and Nazis.  The Allies had a command system where individual initiative resulted in local commanders changing orders when the need arose versus the Germans who had to seek the Fuhrer's approval for command changes.  Book also had nice little biographies of those who contributed to the victory. A nice read and picture book for those interested in World War II.  There are many books on this famous day and battle, but this is one of the better ones.
