 This is a great book.  The story takes place in 1962 when a black veteran James Meredith tries to enroll in University of Mississippi.  Since Ole Miss is a white school, he is refused.  After court injunctions, the Mississippi state government and Governor Ross Barnett flatly refuse to enroll Meredith.  The Federal Government through similar attempts also tries to enroll Meredith.  Finally two weeks into the fall semester, Federal Marshalls and government troops are called into action to enroll Meredith.  White students and right wing radicals from surrounding states decide to confront Meredith and the registration process and a riot/battle ensures.  The battle is the climax of the book.  It is amazing this happened in my lifetime.  I am surprised how narrow minded these people were in intregating the University of Mississippi. I commend Doyle on a great book.  He tells the story with suspense so it becomes a page turner.  This is not a short book, but the reading flows well and it becomes an easy read because of how the author approaches the subject.  This book also is well researched and is ground breaking telling the reader of a little known conflict that most people now would like forgotten. Great story.
