 Webster gives a lot of detail of the history of Marketing in this book.  It includes all the recent develpments in Marketing and how it has affected the customer.  For those interested in how Marketing focuses on the customer, this is a great way to understand the marketing of a particular product.  That said, this fact packed book is about as dry as can be.  If you read this book, you will see how the reader has to slog through this material.  Lots of facts and theory, but little in the way of interesting the general public. One market for this book is to university students in Marketing.  This book is a great summary of where Marketing will go in the future, and this could help the student.  Few people would find this book interesting, other than sales people and Marketing.
