 I thought the writing for this book was above average and the story was very readable.  I guess I am going to have to read Son Thang, An American War Crime by Solis to get the other side.  Herrod portrays his story of serving under Oliver North during the Vietnam War.  His portrayal of Lt. North resulted in me gaing a new respect for someone I don't like politically.  As another reviewer has already stated, Herrod's account may be self serving.    What did happen at Son Thang.  Herrod says that people shot at him and his four companions on the hunter-killer team.  One bullet grazed the neck of his buddy, and shot away the rifle stock on his M-16.  They were then chased but to the fire base.  North provided compelling testimony of Herrod's character. His defense resulted in his acquittal. At the end, there were 16-17 dead civilians, some of whom may have been Viet Cong.  The story is very readable.  This tells one side of the story.  The book on Son Thang tells the other side.  Marines were placed in the difficult position here.  At this point, I am not sure what is true and what is not.
