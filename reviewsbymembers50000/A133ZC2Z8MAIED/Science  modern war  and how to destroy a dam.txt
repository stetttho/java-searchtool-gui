 What a great little story from WWII.  I heard about this successful raid, and finally I stumbled upon this great little book describing the raid.  The book starts by describing the thought process of Wallace who thought the dams would be a worthy target of British bombers.  The floods would destroy factories and limit the output of water and energy in the industrial Ruhr area.   Wallace had to surmount bomber limitations, design a new type of bomb, and devise a method on how to deliver the bomb load against the side of the dam.  These processes are all investigated and solved in the course of this book.  The final bombing run is the high point of the book with the successful destruction of the dams.  The loss in bomber crews plus the German civilian losses are also summarized.  I wish the book could have focused more on the later aspects of the raid, rather than the science that went in solving how to destroy the dams.  Otherwise a great read.
