 A wonderful read about Lincoln's life in the last 24 hours and the conspiracy that resulted in his assassination.  This is a wonderful book, and one only grows to admire Lincoln after reading it.  One also sees how Booth and his assorted idiots planned the killings.  A determined effort by the government in protection for key members could have prevented this.  The President's  bodyguard went off to a bar, along with the other staff.   Bishop researched this book for twenty to thirty years before writing it.  The only criticism is that the beginning drags a little, but otherwise a great read.
