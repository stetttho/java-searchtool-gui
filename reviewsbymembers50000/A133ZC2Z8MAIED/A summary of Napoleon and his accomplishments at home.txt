 For those seeking a biography of the man or his military accomplishments, this book does not fit the bill. Horne focuses on the political, economic, artistic, and scientific accomplishments of Napoleon and the Napoleonic Regime.  So this book focuses on an area not covered by most authors.  Since Napoleon is a topic that many authors have attempted, Horne focuses on an area not usually written about.  Napoleon changed a lot in France, and Horne outlines both his accomplishments (Code of Napoleon for law, and scientific research) and his failures (theater, opera, and literature). This is not an easy read, despite its brevity.  It is a read that will enlighten a Napoleonic historian.  However, the subjects and concepts are more difficult to understand than the military victories.
