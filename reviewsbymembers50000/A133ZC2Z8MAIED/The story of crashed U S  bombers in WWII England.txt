 I am going to disagree with the previous reviewers and state this book was only an average read.  Why?  Because the writing was marginal (with some mistakes) and most of the stories were of bombers crashing in WWII England.  The pictures in this book were excellent.  The photographer (one of the authors) snapped some great pictures on the death and destruction caused by the crash of these great bombers.   The book is good because it shows how even the bomber crews led very hazardous lives in their war with Nazi Germany.  One can feel the tension in the lives of these crew members who risked all in their flights over enemy territory.  Even over friendly territory, the bombers sometimes fell apart and crashed causing crew and civilian deaths.  Indeed these fliers were very brave men. This book has great pictures but only marginal writing.  Check it out of the library, and look at the pictures.
