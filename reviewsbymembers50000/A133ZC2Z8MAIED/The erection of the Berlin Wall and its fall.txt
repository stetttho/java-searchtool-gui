 Although I don't subscribe to Buckley's conservative ethics, this was a good read for such a short book.  It took me all of one day to go through this book.  What I liked best is the first chapters talking about the loss of population in East Germany due to the easiness of walking into West Berlin and emigrating to West Germany.  The erection of the wall prevented this exodus in 1962.  It simply stopped the flow and erected the barrier to the population shift.  What I dispute is Buckley's view that the East Germans would have stopped the building if a few American tanks rolled over the barbed wire barricades to assert their rights of the four powers in Berlin.  This might have started a Third World War.  Perhaps Buckley has seen some documentation that I don't know about.  The later part of the book I witnessed in person in Eastern Europe, so this is something I was very familiar with.   Buckley throws in a few complicated words in this book, so I had to consult my dictionary.  I did not know there was a word for throwing someone out of a building, but apparently Buckley found one.  I have already decided not to add this word to my vocabulary.  Other than that, this is a nice little read for someone interested in the Cold War and Eastern Europe.
