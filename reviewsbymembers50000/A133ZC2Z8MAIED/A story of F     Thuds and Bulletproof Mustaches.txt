 This is a nice edition to the Vietnam literature.  Most have heard of the grunts pounding the ground in South Vietnam and maybe an occasional story of a helicopter pilot, but there have been few stories of the pilots flying out of Thailand and going north to bomb North Vietnam and Laos.  As for this story, Raz does a good job of keeping the interest of the reader as he recounts his training and deployment in the F-105 Thunderchief. The Thunderchief was really an aircraft that should have been kept home and the new Phantom sent instead.  However the author tells the story of his 100 missions over North Vietnam and his bombing runs in various parts of North Vietnam.  He should be proud he served his country in 1966 and later.   The reading is light and the flow of the book kept the interest of this reader.  This is a nice story of the difficulties a F-105 pilot experienced in his deployment in Southeast Asia.  I hope Rasimus decides to write a follow up book on his later tour in the Phantom.  Keep wearing that bullerproof mustache, it helps your writing ability.
