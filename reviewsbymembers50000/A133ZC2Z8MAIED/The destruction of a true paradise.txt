 I like Howarth's books and this is no exception.  In this particular book, Howarth details the destruction of the true paradise of Tahiti.  First the British and later the Spanish and French come and in essence destroy the island paradise of Tahiti. How did the Western powers do this?  By imposing their morals and attititudes on the islanders who were already a generous and friendly people.  First rough sailors invade the islands and give the islanders sexual diseases.  The islanders were generous in both providing the sailors foods and any sexual favors they desired.  Then missionaries came and tried to impose their morals on an already generous and good people.  These morals also led to the destruction of the people.  Introduction of materialism also hastened the end to these people. The results of all this change was a drastic reduction in the islands population and a complete change in the people's attitudes.  Later colonialism by the French and tourism destroyed whatever remained of this fabulous culture.  One of the reasons few native cultures now exist in this world, is colonialism and tourism destroying the essential aspects of the natives.  Tahiti changed because of the actions of the British and French.
