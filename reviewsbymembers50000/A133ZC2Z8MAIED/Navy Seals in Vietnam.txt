 As if we don't have enough books about Special Forces in Vietnam, here is still another one.  Dockery's writings do not have the flow, and this short book takes longer than needed.  The reader gets information about some of the missions, equipment, and the Brown Water Navy.  The Navy Seals did not contribute as much as the Marines and Army in Vietnam.  Still we get another book about Special Forces.
