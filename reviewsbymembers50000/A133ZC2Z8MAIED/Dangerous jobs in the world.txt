 This is not a bad book, but it is not a great book either.  Junger wrote well in The Perfect Storm, and followed this with a collection of articles written for magazines.  These articles were well written, but they didn't have the pull that The Perfect Storm has. Junger did most of the investigation into these dangerous jobs after he was hurt in a tree accident.  Forest fire fighters were his introduction piece and I was amazed how dangerous this job is. Junger follows with investigations into the conflicts in Afghanistan, the former Jugoslavia, and Cyprus.  Then he makes a stab at whale hunting in St. Vincent.   For such a short book, this collection of essays does not hold the imagination of the reader.  Yes the articles are interesting and educational, but one can well read another book and get more interest.
