 Royle tells the short history of Empire in British Africa.  Most of the focus is on the end of British colonies in Africa and the viewpoint of how Great Britain did in ruling this diverse empire. Trevor Royle has an upbeat analysis of the effects of British rule on the various territories, but I am not sure it is based in reality.  Nigeria has gone through civil war and decades of military rule.  Kenya has gone through corrupt rule by Moi, after Kenyatta.  Zimbabwe is ruled by a Marxist dictator.  Perhaps British rule was better than independence.  However, there is no lasting tradition of stable and democractic government for most of British Africa.   This book explains much of what happened in the last few years of British rule.  This book informs the reader of the various territories and how they fared in the last year of colonial rule and the first years of independence.  However it paints only a limited picture, and might be to pro British.  This book fills in some of the gaps of African history.
