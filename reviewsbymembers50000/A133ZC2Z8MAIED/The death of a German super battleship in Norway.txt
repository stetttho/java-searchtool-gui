 An average read about the life and death of the Tirpitz, the sister ship of the Bismarck.  The author was on one of the British ships protecting convoys to North Russia, and the Tirpitz posed a risk to these convoys.  He also produced a BBC show on the same ship. This book is a picture book of this super battleship.  She posed a risk and tied down many British ships of the line.  As a result, the British tried a number of times to sink her by submarine and aircraft.  These many attempts at first damaged the ship and then sank her.  The British story about the pursuit and sinkings of this ship is almost as dramatic as that of the sinking of the Bismarck. Kennedy's writing is OK.  The pictures are great.  The ULTRA translations are adequate in the telling of this story.  It seems ULTRA played a big part in how the British accessed the threat from this super battleship.  This is a great story, but an average read.
