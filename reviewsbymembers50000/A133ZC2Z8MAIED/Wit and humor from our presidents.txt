 Indeed I wish Bob Dole was in this book, instead of reporting on the wit and humor of the highest office's previous occupants.  I believe humor and the ability to laugh at yourself is a great asset with any person in high office.  When Dole lost in 1996, he stated he slept like a baby....he cried all night.   The book is structured on rating the president's ability to crack jokes.  Many people believe that Lincoln and FDR had great wits.  Dole states the many unknowns such as Coolidge's jokes about his silence.  Some of our underrated Presidents had great wits.  This is a nice little humorous read.  If the reader needs an uplift, this is a great book to begin with.
