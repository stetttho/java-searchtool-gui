 I read Dizdarevic's first book, and I think this is as good as the first.  Both books are rather brief, so they could have been combined with a book of only 300 pages.  However after the success of the first, the publisher probably wanted to make a little more money on a second book of war stories.  That said, the stories are powerful about the cruelity of war and its consequences.  Some of the stories at the end are the most powerful, especially about the wayward boy looking for his father in the trenches.  Some of the others, the reader is left scratching his/her head on what the author was trying to convey.  This is simply a collection of stories from the residents of Sarajevo to the outside world. For a quick read on the siege of Sarajevo, both Dizdarevic's Sarajevo: A War Journal and this book are good human interest reads.  The reader can go through them in a three hour sitting.
