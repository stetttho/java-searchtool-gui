 As some of the previous reviewers have noted, this book reads like a novel.  However it is true and 297 GIs were either killed, wounded, or captured due to Patton wanting to free his son in law John Waters from a POW camp behind enemy lines.  Patton was a controversial general, and this action was very controversial.  Patton basically risked the lives of 297 men in order to save one man who was not in danger of death anyway. The commander who conducted the raid wrote most of this book, along with two other participants.  The writing is good in places, especially where Baum is describing the action.  It seems to me the other two authors also wrote sections of this book, and perhaps their writing was not as good as Baum's.  The action is a thrill and reads like a novel.  Baron's description of the POWs is less interesting and wanders at time. Altogether a great read about an unbelievable battle of World War II.  Highly recommended just for the content.
