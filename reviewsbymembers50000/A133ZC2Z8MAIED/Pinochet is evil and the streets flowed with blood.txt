 As Timerman is an Argentine, I expected him to equate Pinochet with the Argentine military rulers.  This is not what he does.  He makes Pinochet the focus on his topic of evil.  Well 3,000 (not 700 as Timerman states) people were murdered or disappeared in Chile compared to over 20,000 in the Argentine.  Pinochet did rule using fear and torture.  He also stabilized the country and built up the infrastructure.  If you were only to read Timerman's book, you would think very few people favored Pinochet.  I can assure the reader there are elements in Chile (not a majority) who think Pinochet did the right thing.  Well, Timerman's viewpoint is from the left, and not very objective. I loved Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number.  Timerman's other books are suspect.  He writes from a leftist objective.  Allende was a terrible President of Chile, and yet we don't hear those viewpoints.  I believe Pinochet was bad too.  Torture, disappearing people, and murder should not be used as a tool to suppress people.  What you read in Timerman's books colors Pinochet's rule, but not Allende's regime.  If you are biased, you might as well be biased in all your writings.  There are some good books out there describing Pinochet's rule.  Please consult Soldiers in a Narrow Land, or Chile under Pinochet, A Nation of Enemies.  These are much more objective, and the reader will not suffer the leftist bias.
