 This is one of the main references for this particular war between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Prussia.  I would not determine it revisionist, since it examines the efficiency of the Prussian Army and the total incompitence of the Austro-Hungarian militay.  In fact, Professor Wawro alludes to the fact that the Austro-Hungarians almost talked themselves into defeat. Wawro demonstates why Prussia and Sardinia won this war, and why the Austro-Hungarians lost.   At times, this book was a difficult read.  Both my Dad and I read this book.  My Dad states this book reads like a history thesis, and since he has a Master's in History, I believe him.  It is not the easiest read, but the reader will get an understanding of the war and the ultimate outcome for Europe.  Since then, Wawro has come out with a book on the Franco-Prussian War.  I can't wait to start this book and compare it to Howard's book on the same subject. For one wanting to understand the rise of Prussia and the decline of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, this is a challenging but enjoyable read.  A good read.
