 This is a short book, but very difficult to read.  This is surprising since the author has a Nobel prize for literature.  It is also rather dated.  The author writes about his feelings after the military dictator Abacha annulled the election of June, 1993.  Several months later, Abacha hanged another noted author.  Soyinka writes about the wasted life of Nigeria under the various military dictators.  He predicts that if the military dictatorships continue, Nigeria will break up into pieces, and there will be nothing left to argue over.  He also details the military and political kleptocracy that has taken over Nigeria since independence.  Things have gone to the worst state imaginable, and only democracy will cure this. I found myself laughing at some points in this book because the author has a way of detailing how he feels about the military dictators who have run his country.  He makes them out as idiots. The author uses complex language and assumes the reader has some knowledge of Nigerian politics.  Therefore this book is not for the lay reader.  A difficult read.
