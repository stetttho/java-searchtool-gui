 This was an interesting read.  The author tries to delve into the the lives of the Nazi leader's children and detail how they viewed their fathers.  Some viewed their fathers as great men (Himmilers and Goering's daughters).  Others view things more circumspect, Boreman's eldest son loves his father but agrees his father was responsible for great crimes.  Still others hate their fathers.  Nilklas Frank hates his father to such a degree he celebrates the day his father dies.  Throughout the book, both authors try to delve into the morality of each child and how he views his father's past. I rated this as only a three, although it could well be a four.  The organization of the book leaves something to be desired.  The book goes between the father and son's writing and one has to note what time period he is in.  Also, the author tries to much to place each child in a box.  Who does best as understanding the hurt their father put on mankind and his own role as a father.  These fathers may have done very evil things, but all in their own way was a loving father.  To expect a child to think of his father as a monstor is perhaps bad form.  An interesting read.
