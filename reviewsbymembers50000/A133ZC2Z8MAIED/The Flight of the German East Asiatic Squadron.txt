 This is my second book I read from this author.  He deals primarily with naval matters at the turn of the last century. This book is a short story of the flight of the German East Asiatic Squadron at the start of World War I.  This squadron composed chiefly of two heavy cruisers and three light cruisers roamed the Pacific from the start of the war till December.  It inflicted a stinging defeat of a British squadron at Coronel, and was subsequently defeated and all five big ships sunk by two battleships off the Falklands. This author has many good books about naval matters, but unfortunately most are out of date.  I just purchased  A Fleet that had to Die written by this author, so that one is in print although difficult to get.  Good reading for those who can get their hands on Hough's books.
