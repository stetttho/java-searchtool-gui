 Another fine book from Edgerton.  For an anthropologist, Edgerton does a good job writing history.  There have been several fine books about the Congo Free State and even Mobutu's Zaire, but none have wrapped up the history of this huge country as Edgerton has in this recent book.  Basically, the author starts out with the description of the country, followed by a chapters on discovering the Congo, the Congo Free State, Belgian Congo, the independence and civil war period, and Mobutu's Zaire. The history goes through 2001.   I would have loved to see some views on what will happen to the Congo.  Edgerton states that this country is rich in natural resources, but I wonder if it can really remain one single country due to the many tribes who live in the DRC.  Ethnic hatreds flamed by neighboring aggressive countries will test the strength of this country remaining as one.  If not, perhaps the DRC and it's people will continue to hang on after more bad governments.  For those interested in Africa, this is a worthwhile book.
