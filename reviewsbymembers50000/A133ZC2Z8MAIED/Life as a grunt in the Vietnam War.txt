 First, I don't know what book those previous people read, but I only consider it an average read.  Leninger intersperses his book with official communications, radio intercepts, and other related material which tell the story of the 4th Infantry Division, but rupture the flow of his story.  When Leninger does write, it is very interesting.  Otherwise the government reports are government reports and those are boring even though they talk of KIA, MIA, and WIA. Also, Leninger seems to be a little bit of a slacker, and this is born out in the writing.  He criticizes officers who also made the supreme sacrifice of their life. One lietenant was especially criticized, even though he paid with his own life.   I also don't like the tone of the language when refering to Asians.  I understand Leninger's second wife is an Asian, yet the language appears in the text.  I know grunts spoke like that in Vietnam, but after initially talking about it, why repeat it endlessly.  Leninger held onto his religion in this conflict, but yet he disparages his enemies, officers, smokes drugs, and a number of other things. This is an average read, and for a non professional author such as Leninger that is good.  However, there are better books out there, so if the reader has a choice, read something a little better.
