 I think this is an interesting read even if it a novel.  I read this after a reference to this book in a news story about the coup de etat in the island nation of Comorros.  At that time, some South African mercenaries overthrew the crazed rule of the African ruler of Comorros.  That is where the reference to the Dogs of War was made.   One of the previous reviewers thought it was bad for Forsyth to spend so much space on how the coup was organized.  The procurement of all the arms with the export license was very fascinating.  What Forsyth revealed was that coups could be done privately witout the knowledge of governments.  One only had to know how to procure and organize for the overthrow of a government.  I think Forsyth did this well. This is an interesting read.  This may not be on the level of his previous books, but it is still a good read.
