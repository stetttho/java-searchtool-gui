 The book is a short read about the life and abduction of Miss Stone--a middle aged spinster American missionary serving in Macedonia, a part of the then Ottoman Empire.  If people knew the history of Macedonia, they would know that Albanians, Greeks, Serbs, and Bulgarians all consider this part of their ethnic lands.  This is perhaps why all the other reviewers have an ax to grind in regards to who the kidnappers were.  Regardless of who the kidnappers were (and they were probably some of all the ethnic groups), this story portrays the kidnapping, ransoming, and return of Miss Stone and her Bulgarian friend.  The story shows how the American government and NGO reacted to the ransoming on an innocent.  I put this as an average read.  This is a small story that really didn't affect the American government that much.  I give credit to the author for writing about a little known event.
