 This is a nicely told story of the Sepoy Siege of Lucknow as seen by the British soldiers and their loyalist Indian troops.  The siege was indeed a harrowing experience for the trapped Europeans who had once lorded it over the natives.  They were trapped in a small enclave that was pounded by cannons, and shot at by the rebel sepoys.  Many of the soldiers were killed or wounded, which meant a slow painful death.  The reduced rations slowly starved the defenders, while the sepoys tunneling, reduced the defenders energy.  The first relief column was then trapped in an expanded enclave, and the rations were reduced further.  These soldiers and civilians were trapped between five to six months before another relief column evacuated them.  This is a dramatic story and one very little known about in the United States. Edwardes does a good job of explaining the situation and drama from a European point of view.  This is one sided, in that the sepoys were viewed as uncivilized, and the Europeans were the cultured people.  The author provides a nice view of what these trapped civilians and soldiers had to live through.
