 I think the subtitle of the book says it best.  Jon Peters and Peter Guber took Sony for a long and expensive ride in Hollywood. The book also serves as a biography of these two famous gentlemen and how they managed to take credit for a lot of other peoples creativity.  They took credit for other peoples ideas and then promoted the hell out of these movies and managed to make themselves rich.  As the authors put it, most people in Hollywood knew their reputation. It took a foreign business (Sony) buying Columbia to figure out their less than stellar management capabilities.  For this, Sony lost a ton of money. The authors do a nice job of detailing Guber and Peters backgrounds and their unique chance at changing the landscape of Hollywood.  This is a fairly long book, but well written, so the time flies when you read it.  A great read about the sordid business of Hollywood.
