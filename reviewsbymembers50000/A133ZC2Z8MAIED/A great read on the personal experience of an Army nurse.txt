 I read this book in a little over four hours.  It is a great experience of the Soviet population in German blockaded Leningrad.  One can read Salisbury's account of the siege, but for those who like reading on a more personal experience, read Wayne's Shurik.  Wayne (a Soviet nurse)finds Shurik in the bombed out rubble of a neighboring apartment block.  It is winter and Shurik is trying to find his mother (who died in the bombing).  Wayne takes in Shurik, and relates the next year spent with him.  Shurik is a ten year old boy and Wayne is 19 and serving in an Army hospital as a nurse.  Wayne exposes the life of the Leningrad civilians.  Life consisted of bombing, artillery fire, starvation, and other terrors.   This book relates the personal tragedy of war and how it affects civilians.  Children and women often suffer worse in war than the soldiers.  Far fewer books picture the civilian tragedy.
