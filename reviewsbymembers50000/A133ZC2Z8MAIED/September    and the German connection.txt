 In the last six months, I read the New York Times book Out of the Blue, and to be honest the Germans did a better job with this book.  I think both this and Out of the Blue are 5 star reads though.  What really mattered was the extra information Der Spiegel put into this book.  As an example--how did the U.S. Government figure out the passengers who hijacked the four planes?  Well on one of the calls to an airline headquarters, the stewardess stated the seats the hijackers occupied, and one of these was Atta.  This information was not in Out of the Blue. Also interviews with Atta's father and other hijackers families. The beginning of the book talks quite a bit about the two planes which crashed into the World Trade Center.  Not as much info on the Pennsylvania crash or the Pentagon attack.  What is include gives good detail.  There is more in depth material on the New York attacks. The next to last chapter details how much of the operation was conceived and supported in Hamberg, Germany.  Many of the hijackers not only were educated here, but also settled down there.  Since the authors are Germans, much is detailed on the German connection. In the appendix are some of Atta's writing and the drivel of Bin Laden.  One wonders who believes in this stuff.  It is apparent, bin Laden has not only managed to hijack four planes but believers in a religion.  The writers attempt to make some analysis on this in the summary, but it will still leave the reader shaking his head on these beliefs. One small minus was a number of typos in the copy.   Altogether a great read on a tragic event for America.
