 This is a good book for an overview of World War I.  Baldwin does an adequate job of reviewing all the theaters of war.  Some histories of the war don't cover the Russian, Italian, Bulgarian, and Middle East theaters, but Baldwin gives all equal weight.  Thus the reader will have an insight into not only the Western Front, but the politics and battles elsewhere. Baldwin states this is an outline history.  This is what the reader will find if he reads this book.  No individual stories will appear here, just the outline of the war.  Baldwin also limits his own opinion in the book.
