 If there was ever a face of evil, then it had to be Reinhard Heydrich and Adolf Hitler.  Hitler once said about Heydrich that he had a heart of iron.  Reinhard was sadistic and was the architect of the Final Solution.  This was no man with a humane touch, he was in short a monster.  The Czech government in exile and the British sent this man to where he belonged at a terrible cost.   The book details the plot to kill Heydrich.  Surprisely, the murder and details took up perhaps three to four chapters, with the rest of the book dealing with internal Czech politics and how the government balanced between the English and Soviets.  There was some good information on the wartime policies of Bohemia and Moravia (Czech Republic) and the government in exile under Benes in England. The world was a better place without Heydrich.  A short biography is included in the writing, and it shows Heydrich in all his bloody lust.  His own killing was because he had so much contempt for the Czechs.  He and his driver were the only ones on the road, and the killers had a big target, especially when Heydrich told the driver to stop when he saw the guerillas.  This was truly an evil man. The book is a nice read.  It details the bio of Reinhard, plus the detail of plot and murder, and finally the end of those who killed Heydrich.  A good book.
