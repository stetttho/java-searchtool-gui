 Gross's book Neighbors illustrates the latent anti-Semitism prevalent in pre-war Poland and the murderous result when the Poles took action against their Jewish neighbors.  In the town of Jedwabne, two thirds of the residents were Jewish, and after the Germans occupied the Russian half of Poland, the Polish residents of the town and surrounding countryside decided to take things into their own hands.  They massacred the 1500 residents and took their property.  The book briefly details the massacre and the burning of the barn where most of the Jewish residents were jailed.  The Germans took no action, so the Polish residents were the chief culprits in these murders.  After the war, the Poles blamed the Germans and until recently the crime was covered up.  Gross details how the town residents did know and reveals this in the book. I have read some of the comments from some of the other readers.  It is hard to acknowledge crimes committed by one's nationality.  Unfortunately this crime and other related did take place, and people do have to owe up to these things.  I have traveled extensively through Poland and find the same anti-Semitic feelings even today.  Both the Poles and Jews were victims in WWII, but the Poles also victimized the Jews.  If I have any criticism of Gross's book, it is that it was far too short.  Gross needed to describe in more detail these murders that took place in 1939-1941 period throughout Poland.
