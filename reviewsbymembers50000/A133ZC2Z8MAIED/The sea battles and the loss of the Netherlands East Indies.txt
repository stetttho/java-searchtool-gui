 A relatively good book about the sea battles which resulted in the loss of the Netherlands East Indies to the Japanese Empire in 1942.  During these battles, the U.S. lost the heavy cruiser Houston, several destroyers, and the first airplane carrier Langley.  The losses to the Australians, Dutch, and British were more heavy.  The plum target for the Japanese were the oil of the Indies and the rich island of Java.  These battles determined the fate of the Dutch Empire in Asia and placed a threat to Australia. One thing I liked about this book, which I felt lacked in some of the other battle books is the relative strength of the Allies versus the Japanese Empire.  Thomas spent a large amount of page space covering this and why the Allies failed in this crucial battle.   I gave this book an average rating, since the style of writing by Thomas was not page turning.  The battles were detailed, but no personal experiences were written into them.  One faced why the ABDA forces failed and the Japanese won.
