 The killing of Prime Minister Verwoerd of South Africa in 1966 was considered a blow against white supremacy.  In fact, it was the work of a crazed assassin who was acting on his own notions. The assassin Tsafendas was a half breed of Greek/black descent who was torn apart between both races.  His illegimacy was also a source of tension in his life.  Both factors contributed to stress on his mind and the result was the killing of the Prime Minister of South Africa. This was a little known event in the rest of the world but traumatic in South Africa.  Tsafendas by thrusting his knife into Verwoerd demonstrated his hatred of a system that hurt him. Tsafendas was a lunatic, but his action showed the resistance of some to white supremacy.  The book is a short but good read about a little known event.
