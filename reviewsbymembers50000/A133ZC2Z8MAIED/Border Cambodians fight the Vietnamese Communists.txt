 There are thousands of books that come out each decade about the Vietnam War.  I think the story told in this book is worthwhile, since it gives the account of border Cambodians in their fight with the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.  I would not label it a literary masterpiece, simply because it is a combat story of why America lost the wars in Southeast Asia.  These ethnic minorities in Vietnam were promised American support in their efforts to rid their homeland of occupiers (namely the Viet Cong) and America turned its back on them in order to leave the Vietnam War.  Who suffered:  the ethnic Cambodians who fought against the Communists and were killed off. This book also puts an end to the story by liberals that the Viet Cong were liberators of the South.  They killed, taxed, and made the local Cambodian population suffer their brand of Communism.  The South Vietnamese may not have been much better, but at least they respected the local population better.  This is a story of American betrayal of the Cambodian population of South Vietnam.
