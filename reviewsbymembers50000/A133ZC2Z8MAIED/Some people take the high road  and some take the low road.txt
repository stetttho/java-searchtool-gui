 This is an inspirational message.  I recently visited Branson, Missouri and picked up a copy of this book.  Branson residents assure me this book is true and is based on Wright's visit to this region in the late 1800s.  At the end of the story, Wright's image appears as the artist painting the Ozark mountains.  I saw the cabin where much of the story takes place. For those interested in a book that is as lively as Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn, this is a good addition.  Why, because the language is much the same as what Twain uses in his book.  The author was once a minister, and the main character in the book is a former minister working as a shepherd of a flock of sheep. The reader should understand there are plenty of references to God in this book, but this is not the main tenet of this book.  This is a pleasant read and there is an inspirational message in the story.  I read this 250 odd page book in less than a day, so the reading is light and at first difficult due to the language used.  However, I would recommend this book to anyone desiring to read about the endless conflict of right versus wrong.  This book is based on true events.
