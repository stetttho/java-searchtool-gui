 A good overview of Germany's famous airmen of World War I.  Not only are the fighter pilots reviewed, but also Zeppelin and seaplane pilots, observers, and the the generals that reorganized the air service.  Some criticism of what should have been in the book:   1.)  drawings of the Allied and German aircraft 2.)  drawings of the medals recieved by these German airmen. Also, the grammar was not right in some cases, especially when referring to months.  A good overview of the heroes of the German air force in World War I.
