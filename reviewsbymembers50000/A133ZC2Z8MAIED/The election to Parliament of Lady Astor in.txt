 Anyone knowing the history of Winston Churchill visualizes the confrontations he had with Lady Astor.  The author includes one in her book about poison.  Another one has Winston being drunk, and Lady Astor confronting him and he responding Yes I am drunk, but tomorrow I shall be sober and you shall still be ugly.  I wanted to know a little more about Lady Astor and this book gave me a brief insight into her.  It was an average read, and I commend the author on writing something original.  In this age where we have three or four books coming out about Benjamin Franklin, it is refreshing to have a book about an original subject like the 1919 election of Lady Astor. This book is dry in places because the author focuses on the use of language in the election of Lady Astor.  It is rather a short book, so she should have just concentrated on the election and detailed more of the aftermath of the election and the rise of Nancy Astor.  Again, the author has done a good job of detailing the rise of this remarkable woman.
