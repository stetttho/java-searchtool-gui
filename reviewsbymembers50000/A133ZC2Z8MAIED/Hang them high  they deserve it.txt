 This is a brief story of a B-24 bomber crew that had to leave their plane after bombing an airport near Hannover, Germany.  The nine members of the crew were captured by German military.  After capture, eight of the members were being marched to a Stalig POW camp. They had to disembark their train because of damage to the railway lines from a RAF attack the previous night. This raid caused considerable damage to the nearby town of Russelsheim, home of the Adam Opel Werks, a munitions and auto plant.  Most of the German civilians of this town were unharmed, although many of the slave laborers were killed in the RAF raid.  As they were marched through the town, they were set upon by the German civilians and six were killed.  Most were stoned, beaten with hammers, 2 by 4s, and shovels.  A local Nazi official shot four of them with his pistol, gang land style.  Of course, when the American Army marched into this town, many forgot about this crime and said they had no part in it.  The story reviews the trial and the execution of six of the murderers.  Three others (two women) were later released after serving jail terms.  These three had been condemned to death.  Other civilians of this riot were also given jail terms.  The author tries to evoke some sympathy for the German civilians and refers to the bomber crews as Terror Fliers.  Well, I wasn't taken in by this kind talk.  What this pack of 150 civilians did was cold blooded murder.  Justice was served by Leon Jaworski, latter of Watergate fame, who made sure the leaders of the pack got what they deserved--the hangman's noose.  The people I feel sorry for were these poor men being stoned to death, or the slave laborers at the Adam Opel Werks.  Those would be the people to feel sorry for.  I give the author credit for writing about something that wasn't known.  This book predates Flyboys, so the author should be credited with writings an interesting story.
