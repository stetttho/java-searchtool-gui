 This book was not read for pleasure.  My boss stated I had to read it, because his boss thought it was a necessary read.  After reading it, I have to agree that this book is a good leadership model for those people who manage people.  Even for such a structured organization as the U.S. Navy, the author proves that working with your people helps the organization attain success.  However, Abrashoff is just restating what corporations and other organizations learned in the 1980s. A proven way to satisfy your customers is to work as a team toward your organization's goals.   This is a great read.  The author should be complimented about changing how his organization functioned on his destroyer.  As I stated, this was only unique in the setting in which it took place.  Most corporations have used for some time these principles Abrashoff talks about.  That is why it is a little annoying to read all those I did this, I did that sentences in the book.  Abrashoff worked in a team, of which he was the leader and the principles were well established.  Abrashoff only implemented them in a military setting, rather than in a corporation. The book is chalk full of stories about Abrashoff changing how sailors functioned on the Benford.  It is a good read to reinforce managers stuck on doing things the same old way.  It is also an enjoyable read.
