 This is an easy read of the story of the 82nd Airborne in the invasion of Panama.  Briggs served in this unit as a First Lt, and he describes his experiences in Operation Just Cause.  His unit occupied the city of Colon and came into conflict with the PDF and the Dignity Battalions.  Since the conflict was not short, that means the book is also short, about 155 pages total. The one thing this fails to relate is why the conflict took place.  This is purely the experiences of a small unit in this small conflict.  If one wants to understand why the United States invaded Panama in 1989, one has to read elsewhere, such as in The Fall of Tyrants.  A pleasant read about a small conflict which lasted a few days.  I like Briggs description of the evolving roles the military has to play in the conflict from combatant to constable.  This is relevant to our present status in Iraq.
