 This is a great read for anyone having a family or coming to terms with family problems.  Bryan came from a disfunctional family and spent a decade of his life blaming his family for the letdowns in his life.  Once he saw his family was not the problem and he was, he came to terms with his family and decided to become a member of the family again.  This book mainly focused on the interaction between children and their parents, but it can be used with other relationships.  This is a great read for any of us who have problems with their family, because it councils us in how to behave in the proper manner.  As Bryan himself also states, he even has to work on how to see his family in the proper light.  This gives great insight into family dynamics, and is useful reading for anyone. I plan on using some of Mark's principles with my family.  Family matters, and as Mark show, some of us have some pretty heavy baggage.  Losing the baggage is a first step in coming to terms with your family.  Good read and great advice.
