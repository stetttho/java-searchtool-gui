 A great read about the political system in much of Africa. Why are African countries failing, and the rest of the world is advancing.  It is because of the horrible leadership of much of the African states.  Russell details the misrule of Mobutu, Banda, Mugabe, Savambi,and Moi.  South Africa under De Klerk and Mandela is an example to the rest of Africa, but even then the possibility exists that Africans may be disappointed by the eventual outcome.  In ten more years, I would like to find what Russell says about the possibilities of Africa.
