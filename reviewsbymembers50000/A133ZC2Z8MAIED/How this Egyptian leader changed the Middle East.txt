 This is a breezy and glossy review of the life of Anwar Sadat. Unfortunately, it was written prior to his murder, so there is not much critical information of this leader.  At a little over 100 pages, it does not go into great detail on his life.  That said, it does tell the history of Sadat from his humble peasant beginnings to the Egyptian Presidency. I mention that the book is not as critical as it could be since Sadat did engage in guerrilla (terrorist) activity against Farouk's government and the British military.  Sadat was in a group that planned assassinations.  So I believe the book does not give a critical view of his early life.  However, the later part of the book gives us the image of Sadat going against the flow and making peace with Israel.  At that point, the book ends.  As we know, Sadat was himself assassinated...
