 Altner was a seventeen year old German when he was inducted into the German Army and fought for five weeks in the defense of Berlin.  This book is the story of those five weeks.  As a previous reviewer has noted, Altner is not very careful in his descriptions of arms, tanks, aircraft, etc.  Footnotes are provided that fill in much of this information.  What is a seventeen year old interested in....food and sex, and so some of the story focuses on these two items at the expense of others. Altner also focuses on the traumatization of war, seeing a friend without his nose and eyes, walking past a wounded soldier without stopping, watching wounded soldiers be run over by tanks. One gets a pretty vivid portrait from this seventeen year old kid of what war is like. Although an interesting read, there are better stories out there such as Sajer's The Forgotten Soldier.  Altner's experience was only five weeks, so perhaps it was not a complete picture of the war on the Eastern Front.
