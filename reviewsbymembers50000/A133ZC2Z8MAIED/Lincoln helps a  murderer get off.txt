 Walsh certainly comes up with an interesting topic that has been bypassed by other historians.  The case involves Duff Anderson and his use of a deadly weapon in killing a large man.  Because of his friendship with the family, Abe Lincoln defended Duff in court and got him acquited of the charge of murder.  In the trial itself, Abe may have used an incorrect almanac, and this was not challenged by the prosecution.  Because of this, a guilty man may have went free.  Walsh also questions other Lincoln cases in the book.  This is all interesting reading, even though unproven.   I give the author credit in writing about a topic that has not been explored in great detail.  He writes this as history, but there is not enough evidence here to convict Lincoln.  Lincoln used the full extent of his powers to defend his client.  At this stage, there is not enough documentation to prove he doctored the almanac.  This is a quick short interesting read.
