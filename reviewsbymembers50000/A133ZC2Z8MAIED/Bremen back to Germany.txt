 I wondered why I never heard this story before.  The Bremen was a huge ship (over 50,000 tons).  In late August, 1939 the Bremen found herself in New York harbor with war clouds gathering in Europe.  The Bremen left New York after many hurdles put up by the American administration and proceeded to cross the Atlantic and dock in North Russia.  Three months later, this same ship left North Russia and came back to Nazi Germany.  She narrowly escaped a British submarine on her way home. First off, I believe the story of this ship was rather inconsquential.  It was a somewhat interesting story for those interested in World War II.  However this liner never was important to the war effort and later sabotage prevented it from serving any other purpose in the war.  It was of interest to show how Roosevelt was not neutral at even the beginning of the war and how the Soviets helped the Nazis at the start.
