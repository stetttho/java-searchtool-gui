 Thomas details how the British, French, And Israelis came into the Suez Crisis of 1956.  Each country had their own reason for opposing Colonel Nasser.  Each acted in their own interests.  Although Eden was a brillant diplomat, he was not leader material.  He failed to bring the Labour opposition or the Americans into the military component of the war.  With these opponents as well as the Russians and Egyptians, Eden ceased military operations shorly after he began them without getting to his objectives. This is not one of the better books by Thomas.  First he does little to detail the military operations, but spends a great deal of time on the politics.  Second, he fails to show how the Soviets were hypocrits.  Condemnation of the British And French action, while ignoring what the Soviets were doing in Hungary.
