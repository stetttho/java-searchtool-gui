 I liked this story about Vietnam.  The author spent some time in Vietnam during the early phase of the war (1965-66).  What struck me was the comradely focus of his experience.  He depended upon his buddies.  The Vietnam population was pro-Communist in his sector.  Sasser was enraged when the civilian population watched the progress of Marines through their villages and waited for the booby traps to spring.  It is no wonder that certain soldiers held grudges against the population when the time came.  He was in one village where Cronkite was broadcasting as Marines fired the town.  What one didn't see in this village was the weapons cache found in the tunnels and bunkers under the town.  This is one man's experience of the war in its early phases.  I liked this very much even though some of the stories are not for some people.  This is an interesting read.
