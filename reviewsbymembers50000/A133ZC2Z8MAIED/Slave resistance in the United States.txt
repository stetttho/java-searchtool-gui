 There is a certain amount of revisionist history floating around that the slave/master relationship was one of benefits to both slave and master.  Katz puts this to bed by saying resistance was fairly common and the master/slave relationship was one of exploiter/exploited.  Not only did slaves take over ships (Amistad), but they escaped to the North and Canada, started slave rebellions, and resisted in the plantation, factories, and homes of the slave holders.  Slaves also destroyed the plantation economy of Santo Domingo and hung their slave masters.   Katz relays in this thin book about how slavery debased humanity for both the black and white population.  This is a good short book about why slavery needed to end and answers the charges of the revisionist historians.
