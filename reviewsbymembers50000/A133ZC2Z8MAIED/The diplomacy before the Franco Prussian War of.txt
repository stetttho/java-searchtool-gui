 A nice little read of the diplomacy of Bismarck and Napoleon III prior to the Franco Prussian War.  What is so apparrent by this book is how the French and the French government were so arrogant about their power.  Most people subscribe to the fact of Bismarck causing the war.  However this book shows how the inflamed opinion of the French and their government led to the war.  Popular opinion blames the Prussians but it was the French who caused the war. Wetzel shows the French interfering in the affairs of the Spain to place their candidate on the throne.  The Spanish provisional government was not especially interested in their candidates, and ultimately decided on a Prussian prince.  This was even more unacceptable to the French government.  They then demanded the Prussian prince to renounce the throne.  This the Prussians did.  Then they demanded the Prussians apologize for their actions and completely renounce any interest.  When this did not happen, they went to war against a German nation angered by the French actions.  Subsequent actions paint the French as the victims when the opposite was the case.  The French played into the hands of Bismarck.   A great read for those interested in the diplomacy prior to the war.  Michael Howard's Franco-Prussian War is also a great read of the war itself.
