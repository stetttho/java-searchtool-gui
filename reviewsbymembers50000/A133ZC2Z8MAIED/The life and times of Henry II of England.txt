 This is a average summary of this great King of England.  It summarizes the challenges Henry Plangagenet faced when he assumed control of the Kingdom and his consolidation of his holdings in France.  Henry II was one of the true great rulers of his time, defying the Church and France to lead his realm.  Since Barber wrote this book back in the sixties, it is not up to date on new research into Plantagenet rulers.  Also Barber confuses the reader with the names of many people that were not a central theme of the King's time.  The names are the most confusing aspect of this book, and thus the rating of three stars.
