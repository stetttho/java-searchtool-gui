 I picked this book up while I was in a museum in Reno.  The author is the brother of the former U.S. Senator from Nevada, Paul Laxalt.  I took a few tours while I was in Reno (along with some gambling)and when I later read this book, I knew what book my guides had read, prior to doing their job with the tourists.  I doubt if any state's history can be made interesting, but Laxalt does a good job.  Nevada is an interesting state compared to the rest of the nation, and the author relates why: precious metals, prize fighting, easy divorce, legal hooking and gambling.  All in a state that is at heart very conservative. This is a short read, and for those who travel to Vegas or Reno often, a necessary read.  Why did Nevada become the way it did?  The book answers this question and details some of the interesting characters of Nevada (Mark Twain, Bugsy Seigal, along with a number of politicos).  At a little over 130 pages, this is a great read to take on the plane to Vegas.
