 I never thought a book about a speech would be so very interesting.  White does a great job dissecting this short speech and Lincoln's thinking behind it.  At the time, the speech was not thought of well, but after his assassination, the words became the last testament of this great president.  With malice toward none and charity to all, these words came to embody Abraham Lincoln. I was especially interested in the spiritual aspects in both the speech and Lincoln.  White makes Lincoln come across as a spiritual person, who believed in fate.  The book examines his experience in three Protesant denominations.  As we look at Lincoln's spiritual growth, we find this reflected in his speeches, especially his Second Inaugural.  The last speech contained many references to God. This is a great book about Lincoln.  For those who want to understand Lincoln more, White's book examines a crucial episode in the final stages of this president's life.
