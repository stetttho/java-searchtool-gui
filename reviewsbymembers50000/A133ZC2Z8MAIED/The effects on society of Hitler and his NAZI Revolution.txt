 This is a pretty decent photo book about life in Hitler's thousand year Reich (although it only lasted 12 years).  The authors do a rather solid job of covering the highs and lows of the NAZI regime.  Many authors review the military aspect of the struggle, but this book covers the affects on the German society and population.  The beginning chapters deal with Hitler and the rise of the NAZI party.  Throughout the book are great pictures which summarize the life and death of NAZI Germany. At only 210 pages, this is a good summary read of Hitler and his Germany.  The only thing which I disagreed with was one of the final chapters on the Eastern Front.  It had interviews with two German soldiers captured by the Russians.  These soldiers stated they were fairly treated by the front line soldiers.  I don't doubt that some German soldiers did get fair treatment by the Soviets but the overwhelming percentage were interned and fewer than 10 in 100 returned to Germany after the war.  Other than that, a great read on a most dispictable man and his regime.
