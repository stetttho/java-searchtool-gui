 A nice overview of the Spanish American War and the subsequent Philippines Insurrection.  Earlier summaries of the war do not place much emphasis (if any)on the Philippines Insurrection, but to Marrin's credit, he takes one of the five chapters and discusses it.  This did not always show America to be at its best.  The other four chapters were pretty standard, except little asides about nicknames (Yellow Press, doughboys, Black Jack Pershing, buffalo soldiers).  These little asides were interesting and made the book more informative.  For those interested in wanting to understand the war in two hours, this is a worthwhile book.
