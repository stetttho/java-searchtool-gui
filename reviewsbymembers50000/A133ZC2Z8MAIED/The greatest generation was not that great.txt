 Since the late 1990s, people have romantized the generation that fought WWII.  Fussell doesn't dispel that notion, but puts a dose of reality in this crusade against Nazism and militarism.  mong the young soldiers who fought WWII were cowards, criminals, people who shot themselves, and deserters. Many of our soldiers were heroes, but this generation included the usual people found in any population.  Fussell gives us the lowdown on this Greatest Generation.  The soldiers who fought WWII were young men just entering the world.  They made their share of mistakes on the battlefield like everyone else.  They were not superhumans, but average people put into a difficult situation. This is a great short read.  I would hope people who have fallen in love with the concept of the Greatest Generation should read this book to temper their outlook.
