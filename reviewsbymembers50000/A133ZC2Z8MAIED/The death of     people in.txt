 What was the deadliest disaster in Chicago.  If you said the Chicago Fire of 1871 or the Eastland sinking, you are wrong.  The Iroquois Theater Fire killed close to or over 600 people in 1903.  Like the Titantic, the Iroquois was brand new, but the owners cut corners and the result was a fire trap.  On a matinee performance during the Holiday Season of 1903, the theater was crowded with women and children watching a spectatular performance when a light started a fire.  This fire ignited the overhead scenery in minutes.  People panic brought people running towards the doors, many of which were locked.  Hundreds died of fire, suffocation, and being run over by other people.  If you are interested in the history of Chicago, this is a nice book to read.  Many disasters have gripped Chicago.  This one was one of the worst.  Hatch provides a glimpse of the times in his book.  He not only covers the disaster itself, but also some of the issues with theater management at the turn of the century.  A nice read.
