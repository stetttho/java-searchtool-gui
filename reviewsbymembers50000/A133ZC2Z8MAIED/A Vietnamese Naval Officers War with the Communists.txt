 Actually this was a pretty good book about one person's participation in the war.  Unlike the other readers, I felt that this book got off to a slow start.  His talk about his early life was interesting but I couldn't get a read about what he was trying to convey.  Perhaps he was trying to state he was brought up as an upright moral person in his early years.  His conflicts with the French and then collaboration with them was confusing. I was miffed at his later righteous anger and wrath when confronted with the realities of the war.  Other officers were crooked and could be bribed.  Most of the American officers did not know their positions or behavior in Vietnam.  Then he turns it back on them when he is adapted into an American community.  You can't have your cake and eat it too Kiem.  If you criticize how Americans adjusted in Vietnam, you can't criticize how you adjusted here in the States.  In one passage of the book, he recounts an argument with his wife about his big ego.  I think he showed that in his writings at some points.   If you can adjust for the above mentioned criticisms, this is a good book about a Vietnamese Naval Officer's War.  It is important to get views from many participants in the war, and I think the South's officer core has not written much of the war.  This is a good addition to Vietnam War library.
