 This is a wonderful little story about the building of Santa Maria Del Fiore by Filippo Brunelleschi.  This domed church is one of the marvels of the world and led Medieval man into the Renaissance.  This book details how a dream became an actual building through the genius of Fillippo.  Not only did he solve how a dome could be built of thousands of tons of stone and stay upright, but he managed to design many of the machines that helped build the dome including lifts, and cranes.  This story also details the rivalry of Filippo and Lorenzo Ghiberti who was brilliant in the casting of bronze doors.  These two man not only built, but were also great artists. Ross King does a good job of detailing a story about Renaissance architecture into something that a modern reader would be interested in.  The story is short but very compelling.  The intro leaves a little to be desired but the rest of the story flows very smoothly.
