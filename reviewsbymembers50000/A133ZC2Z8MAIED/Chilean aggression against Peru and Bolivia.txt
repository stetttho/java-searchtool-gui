 One of the little heralded wars of South America is the War of the Pacific.  This war pitted Chile against the combined Armies of Bolivia and Peru.  Chile (the Prussia of South America) defeated both nations in the first year of war and took the nitrate lands of both Peru and Bolivia.  Then Chile invaded Peru and captured the capital.  Why is Bolivia land locked?  She lost her coastland to Chile in this war. Farcau does a good job detailing how Chile was organized better in finance and the military to defeat her neighbors who had a larger population.  Control of the seas by the modern Chile Navy also had a drastic effect on the Allies (Bolivia and Peru).  As detailed in a previous review, the author does a great job of relating the history of this war in a scholarly and readable format.  One thing missing in this book is maps, which would have lent the reader an understanding of the geography of the war.  I cannot understand why maps were left out.  The book is a good read about a long forgotten war.
