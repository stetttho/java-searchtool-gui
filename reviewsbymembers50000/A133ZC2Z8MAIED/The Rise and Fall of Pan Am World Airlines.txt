 A nostalic look at one of the world's premier airlines.  During my younger days, I flew Pan Am to several of its world wide destinations such as London, Frankfurt, West Berlin, Montivideo, Buenos Aires, Miami, and New York Kennedy.  I always liked this airline because of its exotic destinations, but at that point the planes were really old.  The book is a great read detailing the early starting of Pan Am by Juan Trippe and others.  It progresses with Trippe being a visionary in the fifties/sixties with the 707 and 747. These planes really revolutionized the way the public traveled.  Along the way, the author tells the story of the Skygods, old flying boat pilots who flew their planes any way they wanted.  Sometimes they crashed their planes, and after a series of accidents, Pan Am instituted safety procedures that resulted in the company becoming one of the safest.  After Trippe retired, Pan Am's CEOs became just plain bad, and flew the airline into the ground.  The book does answer why Pan Am went Tango Uniform (bankrupt).  Some of the reasons detailed in the book:   1.  Purchasing National Airlines at an inflated price and then       moving National's personnel up the pay level to Pan Am's        level.   2.  Unfair advantages by foreign carriers for passengers       (landing rights, government assistance, and other fees).     3.  No domestic network in the sixties and seventies, even        though the domestics were expanding with international        routes.  This is where the Federal Government was        responsible by tying the hands of Pan Am.    4.  Poor leadership  The last portion of the book details how Pan Am was sold piecemeal to satisfy the creditors, and then the failure in 1991 after the sale of the remaining European routes to Delta.    Gandt is a former pilot with Pan Am, and throughout the book, he details the fall of the Skygods.  His story includes many personal ones which add interest to the story.  Pan Am may not fly anymore, but it is not forgotten.  This is a great read for anybody interested in the airline business.
