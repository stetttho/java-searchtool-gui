 I try not to read about the Kennedys.  There is just way too much material out there relating the story of America's royalty.  I thought I would read this short book to get greater insight into the Kennedy family and the book holds up.  Not only is it concise, but it is packed with information both on the family and President Kennedy.  Also, I feel it is very balanced in showing both the weaknesses and strenghts of this President and his family.  It is probably one of the better short biographies of this President. I recommend this book to anyone wanting a snapshot of this President.  As with all short books, it doesn't delve into great detail about JFK and his family.  However it serves up enough of the dirt about the family and JFK.  Such dirt as the adulteries of both Joe Senior (Gloria Swanson) and Jack (Marilyn Monroe, and many others).  It also shows the family and JFKs strength.  A nice portrait of the family and JFK.
