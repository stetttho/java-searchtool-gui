 The authors and mainly Smith dwell on their vast experience to have their audience confront the fears which plague people.  Since all people have fears which prevent them from moving on and up in life, Smith categorizes these fears and then tells the reader how to confront them.  Confrontation of fears and overcoming them is easier said than done, so the author puts together a plan on how to overcome them.  This is a sound way to overcoming difficulties in your life.  For those who have some sort of fears (as all of us do), this is a plan of tackling those fears. The one problem about this book is the author always dwelling on his own personal conquests of his fears.  After the first dozen stories, one gets kind of tired of this approach.  After reading this, I got the impression the author has a big ego.  However the book gives you a plan on a way to confront your fears.
