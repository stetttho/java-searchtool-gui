 A very good book about Columbia and the ongoing civil war in that country between the government, FARC-UP, and AUC.  Kirk describes the history of violence in Columbia from the assassination of Gatain in 1948 until the present time.  Not only do you have right wing paramilitaries (AUC) and left wing radicals (FARC) along with others, but you have a people that mostly just want to stay out of the way of either.  They are prevented from doing this by the combatants who insist on getting all involved.  They say "Either you are with us or against us".  The poplulation pays the price.  Throw in illegal drugs like cocaine and heroin, with lots of cash to purchase arms with and you have the making of a very violent society.  Kirk's focus is that the consumption habits of American society for drugs, and the U.S. government's commitment to prevent a FARC victory result in the Columbian people being subjected to these forces who are loaded with weapons.  Death rates are worse than any inner city in America.  All combatants, along with those involved in the Narco trade increase the violence in this society.  I would have loved to hear what Kirk wants the U.S. to do.  Americans still consume illegal drugs and a FARC victory would not lead to a peaceful society.  Even if the drugs were not present, this society has degenerated ever more so to violence.  Columbia is a beautiful country and Columbians are very engaging.  When I was there, I saw more military and police than any country in Latin America.  This book is a good read for those interested in this very interesting and troubled country.
