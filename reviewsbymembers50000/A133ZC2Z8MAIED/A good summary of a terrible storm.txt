 Akin is a survivor of the Tri State tornado.  He was only 2 at the time, but his experiences resulted in him taking a lifelong interest in geography and weather.  This book sets out to explain this March, 1925 tornado and its devastating effect on cities and communities in the three states of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana. I found this book entertaining and informative about tornadoes and this particular disaster.  This is a summary read, since the book only explains the disaster and how tornadoes form.  I think Akin does a great job in detailing tornadoes and the 1925 Tri State tornado.  I have not seen any other books about this particular disaster, so I am unsure why some of the previous reviewers have been harsh on this particular book.  I found this a great and interesting read.  At a little over 150 pages, a good reader can read this entire book in five or six hours.
