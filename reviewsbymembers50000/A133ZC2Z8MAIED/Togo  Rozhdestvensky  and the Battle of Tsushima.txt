 This a nice short book about the Battle of Tsushima and the Russian defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05.  There have been other books out there on this war, but the author of this 1969 book actually interviewed some of the survivors of this battle to get a clear picture of what happened during this battle. Busch lays out the beginning of this war and why Japan decided to go to battle against the Russian Empire.  Japan was treated like a child with all the other European empires.  She went to war to get some of the spoils of Korea and the Chinese Empire.  Russia was arrogant against this upstart nation.  When Japan pulled a sneak attack on Port Arthur and bottled up the Russian Pacific Fleet, the stage was set for Russian naval  reinforcements for Port Arthur.  The relief fleet was huge and outgunned the Japanese, but as the Japanese Admiral Togo said, 100 shots and hits is greater than 100 shots and 1 hit.  So the Japanese concentrated on the shots making a hit, and the Russians did not hit much with their guns.  The Russians Admirals were humane and brave people, but their people were not experienced enough to score hits. A nice tale of brave men battling the elements in a battle of two empires.  This is a nice book if you can find it.
