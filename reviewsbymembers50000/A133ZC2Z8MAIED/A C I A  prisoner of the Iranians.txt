 Daugherty was one of three Case Officers of the C.I.A. in the American Embassy in Tehran when it was seized by Iranian militants in 1979.  Daugherty describes his captivity at the hands of the Iranians and gives a short history of Iran-USA relations proceeding the crisis.  This is a very informative read, and I think very balanced at least in the view of internal American politics.  The author is very forthcoming on how he views his Iranian captors.  He concludes and I agree that they were ignorant and naive in their beliefs.  Tehran Mary is portrayed at the height of her ignorance when she didn't even know that Japan had bombed Pearl Harbor.  She is now a high official in the Iranian government. Daugherty describes his views on his Iranian captors, and it is not a pretty picture.  No wonder the U.S. opposes Iran having nuclear weapons.   The author does a great job of describing his introgation, and internment by the Iranian radicals  He successfully opposed them for 444 days.  I rated this only four stars, because of the slow start of the book.  Otherwise a great book.
