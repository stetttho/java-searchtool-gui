 Robert Jackson writes from a British perspective about the Berlin Airlift.  He throws in all the technical details about what aircraft was capable of what lift and the sorties these aircraft performed.  He made an interesting story bland by his focus on the technical details rather than detailing the human viewpoint.  As for the British perspective, the U.K. provided 20% of the lift capacity for the Berlin Airlift.  The book focuses 80% of the content on the British commitment, so one wonders how valid this perspective is. Despite this, if one wonders the why, what, how, of the Berlin Airlift, this book will provide the details.  The technical details might kill the interest, but the book provides the details.  This is an average read on this Cold War crisis.
