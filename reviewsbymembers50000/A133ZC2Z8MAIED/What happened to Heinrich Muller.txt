 I enjoyed two of Whiting's previous books, but this one was hard to follow.  One of the previous reviewers stated this work was rambling.  I have to agree.  The flow in this book from chapter to chapter was terrible.  The author would review one section about the Red Orchestra, then in the next chapter review some aspect of Roehm, Boring, Nebe's life.  One had a hard time with what the author was trying to prove.  Intermingled in this writing was slugs of information about Gestapo Muller.  It almost appeared that the author had a hard time finding enough material about Muller, so anything related to him was thrown into the book. This could have been a good book if the author had focused on the subject.  Rather he threw everything in, including the kitchen sink.  I did learn something about Gestapo Muller, so that is why I rated this two stars.  Otherwise this was a poor read.
