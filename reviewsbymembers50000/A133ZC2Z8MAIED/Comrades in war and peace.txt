 This is such a good mini-series to see that it is worth purchasing either a DVD or Video version of this film.  I read the book, and was somewhat reluctant to purchase and view the film.  Spielberg and Hanks do a great job in recreating the setting of that time.  Not only is the horror of war recreated, but the men's relations with each other develops.  When you face danger, you need to rely on the man in your platoon/battalion.  That need is shown throughout the book.  Good leadership such as that shown by Winters made these men what they became.  The book is a great example of the comradeship in war, but the film is a close second.  For those of you who view the film, read the book and vice versa.  The film and book are five stars.  I usually don't watch many films or television, but I made an exception with Band of Brothers.  It is a great film on an even better book.  At the end of the film are some interviews with 506 PIR survivors, and this is very touching.  These men suffered so much for their country.  This was as good as the film itself.
