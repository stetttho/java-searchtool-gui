 As the previous reviewers have stated, there are some words of wisdom from the thinking of Gerry Spence.  There are also some whoppers, which detract from the book.  Spence is verbose, and this also takes away from the book.  This makes him seem arrogant.  Also, as some of the other reviewers have stated, Spence is liberal and you can sense this from his writings.   One thing this book reinforced in me is speaking from emotion.  If you say what is in your gut, it is a more convincing argument for an audience.  Spence convinces us through his choice of words and tone.  I learned some like minded principles going to Dale Carnegie.  Other common sense suggestions such as thinking through what you say, then commiting it to paper are also there. Suggestions on arguments in the family are also good sense.  These are the good points of the book.  Most of the rest is just fluff, and can be left to better authors. If one is in the law, this is a great book.  Other readers can look for better books on how to get your point across.
