 This is a very readable book.  It established the missed opportunities the United States had in getting rid of Saddam Hussein.  Bush and then Clinton bungled options to rid the world of this man.  Also does a great job in  explaining the various factions opposed to Saddam (Shiite, Kurd PDP, Kurd  PUK, INC, INA)  So many factions resulted in Saddam playing one group off  against the other and staying in power.  Also explains the cat and mouse  game Saddam is playing with the West in his weapons of mass destruction.   In addition, talks about the sanctions having adverse effects on the Iraqi  people, but not Saddam's family.  When Bush called Saddam a modern day  Adolf Hitler, I don't think he was far off.
