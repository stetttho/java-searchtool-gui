 The workplace has indeed changed.  Women now constitute a sizeable percentage of the workplace.  Not only have they changed the structure of the workplace but family life is also changing as a result.  The author is a noteable management consultant who relates how moms (and dads) can now structure the family.  A family should not be hierarchial, but focus family tasks on the project system.  All members should at least have input in the family's decisions.  By this way, there is at least focus on where a family is going.  This is good info for those who try to balance family with work. In the last part of the book, Neale loses focus and ranges against the prevalence of golf at business.  She gets her point across that businesses should try to get new benefits that will help families and not have businessmen improve their golf game. I am all for this.  This book is an easy read and brings up points on how business should be more family focused.  This would not only help women but also men.  The first part about involving all family members in the chores of the family is also very relevant.
