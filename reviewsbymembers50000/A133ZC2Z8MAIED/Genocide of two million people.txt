 I very much enjoyed this book by author Deborah Scroggins.  The book is about her journeys in the horn of Africa, the biograpthy of Emma McCune and the warlords who run the Sudan.  I did't realize how horrible the situation was until I read this book.  There is enough blame to go around for nearly everyone.  First, the Islamic terrorists who run the country.  These people condone starvation as a way to set up an Islamic state.  Bashir and al Turabi are mass murderers and should be sent to the Hague for their crimes.  Then you have the southern leaders of Garang and Riek who are not much better.  Garang who just recently died in a plane crash recruited child soldiers and also was complicit in starvation.  Throw into this mix the aid workers who are idealistic but at the same time don't quite understand the situation they are dealing with.  Emma was one of those aid workers and it seems she was thrilled with the adventure of marrying a warlord and taking sides in a internal civil war in the SPLA (Sudan People's Liberation Army).  Scroggins also relates her history of visiting this very troubled country.  As related in this book, Emma was idealistic and passionette about what she believed, but she was rather naive.  Her entanglement with Riek led to her downfall.  She may also have had personal problems due to her father's suicide.  Her death may have been arranged.  She had all the faults of aid workers believing she could save people.  In the end, she may have been complicit in the deaths of many.  This is a good read shedding light on a very troubled land.  Some of the writing was rather jumbled, and this is why I gave this book a four star.  However this book focuses light on a little known conflict.
