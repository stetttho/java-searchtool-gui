 This is the second book I have read by Michael Savage (Steiner).  I think Savage tries to savage the liberal establishment.  I consider myself a moderate to conservative Republican, and yet all this mean spirited talk by Savage gives both the conservatives a bad name and the liberals enragement on their part.  This drives a big chasm between the political sides in both our government and our general population.  There was a time when conservatives and liberals worked together to govern this country, but Savage would have you believe that there is a war between them and that the liberals have a mental disease.  This is just gasoline on the fire and does not help in good government. One part I did applaud is Savage cutting the Hollywood elite down to size.  These actors in general try to paint the conservatives as stupid, when most of these actors have just a high school education.  Yet, many Americans follow the advice of these people because of their position.  Savage cuts these people down to size and makes them small.  As Robert Duvall stated--"These people should just shut up". There are some valid arguments in Savage's writings.  However, I believe his appeal is more of a shock nature than a reasoned approach.
