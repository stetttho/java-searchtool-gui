 I read this book when I was in grade school.  It was a great book.  Recently I saw a reprint of this book in the supermarket, so I decided to read it again.  What a great story!  Mr. Lawson, since deceased, spelled out how he began his flying career and how he got involved in the mission.  His flying experience over Tokyo (amounting to thirty seconds) was a small factor in this book.  What really makes the story are the heroic Chinese who saved Lawson and his crew from the Japanese.  In the crash itself, Lawson injured his arm, leg, and head.  The resulting infection of his leg resulted in amputation.  His travels in his injured state were the main focus of most of the second half of the book. This is such a great read.  Not only is the author a humble, patriotic man but his story details those who made his escape possible.  A great read for anybody.
