 A wonderful little book about a small tragedy that happened in Boston in 1919.  As a result of an above ground tank rupture, 21 people lost their lives and others were premanently crippled.  Puleo deserves credit for bringing this tragedy to light.  He does a good job of explaining why the tank was located in the poorest, most densely populated portion of Boston, how the tank was put together slap dash, how signs indicated the coming collaspe of the tank, and finally the rupture and the resulting court battle.  The author even includes the attitudes of the largely Italian neighborhood and the execution of the Italian anarchists at the end of the book.  The final summary is a large corporation put the people of this neighborhood at risk for a gain in the war profits from industrial alcohol. This is a good read.  Puleo puts a lot of interesting information into this book and it makes compelling reading.
