 The author-Stephen Bower Young-served as a gunner on one of the main turrets of the battleship U.S.S. Oklahoma.  He was aboard the ship when she was torpeodoed during the surprise Japanese attack.  This story is about his personal experiences during the December 7, 1941 attack and the escape from the ship when it rolled over. Young offers recollections about the life aboard the battleship and the sailors he served with.  Many of these sailors would not survive the attack (448 died). The majority of the book was about the attack and the subsequent escape.  I was most interested in Young's successful escape, when other sailors drilled holes into the bottom of the ship so those trapped could escape.  A most interesting read.
