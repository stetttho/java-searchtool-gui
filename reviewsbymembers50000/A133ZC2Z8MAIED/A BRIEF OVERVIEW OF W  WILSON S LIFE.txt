 A brief history of one of our most idealistic presidents.  The author details his early life in the south, and his academic career resulting in the presendency of Princeton.  For Democratic party hacks, it was easy converting Wilson into the Governor of New Jersey.  Party hacks again nominated him to the Presidency on the Democratic ticket.  From there, Wilson became his own man, and went liberal.   I liked the fact the book give a brief glimpse of Henry Cabot Lodge, Wilson's Senate opponent.  Both were idealistic, however where Lodge could give and take, Wilson had to have all or nothing.  This was Wilson's undoing and may have been the result of his worsening medical condition.   I wish the book was of longer length with more details.
