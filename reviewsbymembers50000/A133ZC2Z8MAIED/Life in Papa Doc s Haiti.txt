 I have read Greene's Quiet American and Our Man in Havana.    This book is just as good a read as those.  Few people have read this as compared to the other two, since the setting is Haiti, the island prison of Papa and Baby Doc.  The Duvaliers are gone, but the memory remains in Haiti. I visited Haiti and Porte au Prince and found the hotel where the setting took place.  In fact Graham Greene wrote his story while living in this hotel.  It is a great old place owned by a family.  Anybody visiting Haiti should stay there.  Pictures of this place should be placed in the newer editions of this novel. For those of you reading this piece of fiction, the Comedians is not funny.  It is about people putting a mask on their true feelings, rather than display them in this island dictatorship. The only true people were the Doctor and Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and Papa Doc.  They did not have to place a mask on their feelings.  They were their true selves.  Jones, Browne, the Minister of Social Affairs, Martha, and the Ambassador were the ones playing the Comedians in this deadly place.  Their struggle in the setting of Papa Doc's Haiti is the story which you see in the Comedians.   This is a good story which is entertaining.  The setting of Papa Doc's Haiti is the real thing, but the rest is fiction.
