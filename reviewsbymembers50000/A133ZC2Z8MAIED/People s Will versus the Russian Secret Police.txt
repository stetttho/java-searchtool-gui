 A great little book about the war between the Russian Secret Police and the terrorist organization People's Will.  The Russian Secret Police was headed by Lieutenant Colonel Sudeikin and the People's Will by Vera Figner.  The People's Will was executing high Tsarist officials and the Russian Secret Police decided to destroy the People's Will from within.  They turned members of this terrorist party against the organization and destroyed it.  Sergei Degaev was turned and betrayed his comrades.  When he finally came to terms with himself, he confided his betrayal to the People's Will and they helped him kill Sudeikin.  He then emigrates to the United States where he becomes a Professor of Mathematics at the University of North Dakota. This is an interesting and quick read.  I find it fascinating that some of the Russian Secret Police actually collaborated with the People's Will.  For a similar story of betrayal, see  Comrade Valentine, The True Story  of Azef the Spy-The most dangerous Man in Russia at the Time of the Last Czars by Richard E. Rubenstein.
