 I believe Sadat was one of the Mid East's great men.  Here was a person who waged war but desired peace.  The world lost a lot when this great man was assasinated by Islamist fanatics.  Neither his predecessor Nasser or his successor Mubarak rate in his league.  If you have read Sadat's book In Search of Identity, then this book is a rehash of much of what he says in his autobiography.  The book expands a little on recent events such as the Israeli bombing of Iraq's nuclear reactor.  Sadat condemned Israel for that. If one wanted an overview of what Sadat stood for, this is the book.  If one wants more, the reader should read his autobiography.
