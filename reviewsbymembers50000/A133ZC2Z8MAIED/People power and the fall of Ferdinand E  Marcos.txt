 A good concise review of the overthrow of the Marcos dynasty in the Philippine Islands.  Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos and their cronies were looting their country in the guse of protecting it from Communism.  The United States stood by and watched them.  Ninoy Aquino came back from exile to confront President Marcos and was killed.  Prior to Aquino coming back, he was warned that his comeback would result in imprisonment or death, and he remarked that the Philippines were worth dying for.  What a true patriot!  Simons does a good job of revealing the situation in the country.  He shows the good and bad of all the characters in this drama.  Cory Aquino was one of the elites, and her leadership after the fall of Marcos left a lot to be desired. Marcos and his cronies looted the country of 26 billion dollars.  The assassination of Ninoy Aquino was indeed tragic.  The military performed this killing with no compunction and then lied in several courts about their role.  The Marcos administration was indeed corrupt and a kleptocracy.  This is a nice read on the Philippine Revolution.  The good guys won this time.  The author does a good job of detailing the corruption of the Marcos regime.
