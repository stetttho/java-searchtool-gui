 I liked this book because it paints the good and bad about George W. Bush.  Bruni covered the Bush Campaign for the New York Times.  In this book, he reveals the real George Bush and the close election of 2000.  There were lots of colorful insight and also jokes played during this campaign.  What this book revealed was an uncomplicated man who was seeking the presidency.  Bush also could laugh at himself, including his fumbling of the English language.  The Presidency was not his all consuming passion as it was for Al Gore.  This knowledge validated my vote for Bush.  Bruni covers only the campaign and the aftermath of the election.  There is only a little background history of Bush before his presidential run.  There are no photos in this book.  The book is strictly a look at Bush's run for the White House in 2000.
