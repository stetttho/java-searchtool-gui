 Davis's book is for young people, but I was surprised of the content and well written material.  One could guess this was an adult book. Davis is a black American and of a general liberal bent.  As you read, you can tell the side he favored in this war--the Loyalists.  He generally glosses over the abuses the Republican government commited during the Civil War, but expands on the attrocities perpetrated by Franco's forces.  Oh well, Davis can slant the way history is perceived. I would say this is a well written book, if one overcomes the slant of Davis's writing.  If one wants a more detailed analysis, read elsewhere.
