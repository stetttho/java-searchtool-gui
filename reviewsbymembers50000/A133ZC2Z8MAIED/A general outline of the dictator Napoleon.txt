 I have been pleased with some of the other books by Albert Marrin.  This book is an OK read.  It is neither a great nor poor read.  One learns about Napoleon Bonaparte and the world he created in France and Continental Europe.  Since this is a short book, Marrin had to shorten some of the depth on this book.  One thing which I liked in other books by Marrin are the interesting asides about words or phrases.  These asides are missing in this book. Marrin is a good author for historical subjects for the young reader.  For this subject, Marrin boils down the substance of Napeleon in a short quick read.
