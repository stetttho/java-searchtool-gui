 I haven't heard of Paul Steinberg before I read this book.  The book is a gem and recollects the life of a camp inmate trying to survive the war.  Steinberg was one of those people who helped  the inmate leadership run the killing camps.  He was a chemist in one of the IB Farben complexes.  His short but powerful story shows how stronger people were consumed, while a flexible youngster survived the camps by doing what he had to do to stay alive. This should be required reading for those people who deny that the Holocaust happened.  It is also a reminder that the general population should always remember these events.  Steinberg found this book hard to write, but it was easy to read and conveyed a powerful perspective.
