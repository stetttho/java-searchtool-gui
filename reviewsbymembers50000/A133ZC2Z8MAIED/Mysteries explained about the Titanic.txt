 Walter Lord follows up his best seller of the fifties-A Night to Remember--with this eighties version on some mysteries about the sunken liner.  One learns about the musicians (two groups actually) and what they played that night while the life boats were being loaded.  Another story details the negligence of the freighter Californian for not answering the eight rockets of distress from the Titanic.  Another story details the shootings and suicide near the end of the launch of the last life boats.  Still another story details why there were not enough life boats on the Titanic and most other ocean liners of the day.  Walter Lord clears the air about these mysteries with his well informed writing. If you want to know more about the Titanic, read both Lord's books on the subject (A Night to Remember, The Night Lives On).  They will help the reader understand this tragedy.  I have seen the movie and I know the producers consulted these books when they made the movie.
