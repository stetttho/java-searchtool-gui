 Very little is known about this massacre, except that over one hundred Indians of Black Kettle's Cheyenne tribe were killed as they were co-existing in eastern Colorado.  Some Indians were indeed renegades but not from this tribe.  Early in the morning, a troop of mostly volunteer soldiers from the Colorado militia raided Black Kettle's village and killed braves, women, and children.  They then mutiliated the corpses.  Hoig describes the situation that led to the massacre very effectively.  Hoig has written many other good histories of the southern Plains Indians.  These Indians were victims of the territorial expansion of the United States.  Many settlers wished them dead rather than supporting their upkeep on reservations.  This shows the sade tale of broken promises.
