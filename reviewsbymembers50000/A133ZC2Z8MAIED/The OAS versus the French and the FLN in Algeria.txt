 Henissart details the last year of French rule in Algeria which resulted in the General's Putsch and the formation and destruction of the OAS.  If the reader is looking for an account of the fight of the FLN, you will not find it in this book.  This is strictly an account of the OAS and pied nor fight for French Algeria. This is a account of the guerrilla role played by the OAS in their fight for French Algeria.  Henissart details the brutalities of the OAS, especially of the Delta commandos.  Salan's role in the uprising is also examined.  Since the struggle occurred mainly in Algiers and Oran, this is where most of the history of the conflict is written.  The author also summarizes the politics of the Fifth Republic and De Galle.  Since the Fifth Republic was so divided politically by the war in Algeria, Henissart gives the reader an overview of the opinions of the French public. This is an excellent book on the last days of French Algeria.  Again I would caution the reader that this book is about the OAS and not the struggle of the FLN.  One only gets pieces of info on the FLN, and thus an incomplete picture of their struggle.  For a more complete read of the struggle in Algeria, read Alistair Horne's excellent book A Savage War of Peace.
