 I have seen some of the other reviews of this book, and I don't understand why some rate it as a poor read.  Deaver offers a personal glimpse of one of our great modern presidents, and his interaction with him.  The book does jump around, but it is an easy read, and enjoyable.  Unfornately Deaver is not critical enough on Reagan on some points, and the book tends to hero worship.  Other than those two points, the book is very enjoyable.  As Deaver says of Reagan, what you see is what you get.   I voted and campaigned for Reagan/Bush is both 1980 and 1984.  I often wondered what the personal Reagan was really like, and this book at least satisfies some knowledge requirements.  Reagan was a complex man in many ways.  This book shows him as a simple man who pursued policy regardless of the poll statistics.  He was also a softy when it came to common people's requests.  This book shows the personal side of a great American President.
