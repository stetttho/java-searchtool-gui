 Snyder's book gives us twenty-five great turning points in history.  From a Western perspective, these twenty-five events are all very valid.  Only one event, the flight of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina could be considered anything other than Western. Other events describe the opening of Japan and Columbus's discovery of America which have tragic effects on the native population.  This book was written in 1971, so the perspective in both dated and not PC.  An author today would be more PC by placing other non Western societal events into the mix.   Other than the above criticism, the points Snyder brings up are worth reading and valid.  The turning points include topics on science, religion, military, and political.  This is a short book, and the summary of the twenty-five events is good.  The reader can then pursue topics which are important to him/her.
