 This was a difficult book to read since it is not really a biography.  In fact you would learn little about Goering's early life from reading this book.  What this book reviews are the policies Goering pursued at both the Luftwaffe and his Economics Ministry.  Goering was no military genius, and he certainly couldn't organize like George Marshall, so he basically was a flop at both these positions.  Yet, he garnered them up and retained them throughout much of the war to the detriment of Nazi Germany.  It was a good thing he was on their side. The other thing that is striking about this book is that Goering made possible much of the war and murderous genocide of the regime.  Even though he acted as the humane face of the regime, he in fact was one of the chief devil's disciples.  He deserved what he got at Nurnenburg.  He was as guilty as Hitler for the genocide, slave labor, and brutal warfare.   This is a difficult read, since it covers primarily the policies of Nazi Germany.  For policy wonks, this is a great read, for the lay reader, probably not.
