 This very fine PBS broadcast details Stalin's War against the Russian People and the German War against the Soviet Union.  It seeks to detail these two wars and how it combined cost the Soviet Union 45 million people.  Why does it matter?  Because in today's world, the Germans are scorned for what they did to the world, but very little is said about what Stalin did to the peoples of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.  That is why it matters and why this film series shows Stalin and his henchman for what they really were.  This film is not for the weak of heart, as it shows some very disturbing scenes and talks about some very revolting subjects.  I watched in amazement as people gloated over a person being hanged.   This is a true horror film starring Stalin and Hitler.  It shows mans inhumanity to man.  This is very much worth watching.
