 Strawson draws the broad conflict between the Axis and Allies in  North Africa in World War II.  This is a British perspective of the conflict, since the contributions of the Americans and Free French were only briefly mentioned.  Also given low priority were the Italians.  Therefore you get an Anglo-German conflict.  Strawson is partially right since the conflict focused mainly on these two nation's armies.  However to disregard the Torch landings in Morocco and Algeria, and not to mention the Free French, one gets the idea the author is being nationalistic. Strawson is at his best in describing the strategies of the various commanders: Rommel, Wavell, Montogomery, and Auchinleck. Unlike previous authors, Strawson is very complimentary on the services of Wavell and Auchinleck since they made victory possible for Montgomery.  Their training, administration, and logistics helped Montgomery win.  The policy and how it applied to other parts of the British Empire also helped to explain the long see saw duration of the battle. A helpful read of the conflict.
