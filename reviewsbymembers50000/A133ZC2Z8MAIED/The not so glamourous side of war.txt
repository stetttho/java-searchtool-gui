 A great short read about an American soldier's experience in the last few weeks of the war in Europe in WWII.  Irwin relates his experiences of capturing a large group of German soldiers, along with the monotony of endless hours spent riding in a tank.  Even though this is a first book for Irwin, it is highly entertaining and will keep you interested.  Just wish he had more experiences to relate in this short book.  Also was disappointed that there was no aftermath on what happened to his tank team mates.  It would have been interesting to find out what happened to them.  However if quality of writing is everything, this book should keep you interested.
