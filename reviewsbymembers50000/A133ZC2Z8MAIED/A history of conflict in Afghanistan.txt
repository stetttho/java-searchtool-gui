 For much of this book, I learned much about the history of Afghanistan and the people who make up this troubled country.  Up till the last chapter, it was a really interesting read.  Then Griffiths starts talking about his viewpoint on the Taliban and why the West should negotiate with the Taliban government.  Griffiths states that America is out for revenge following the September 11, 2001 attacks, and has picked on Afghanistan.  I don't know much about Griffiths' politics, but I do know he didn't know anyone who died on September 11, 2001.  Much of what the world knows about the Taliban after they lost control of the country show them to be a narrow minded religious party out to remake the modern world and turn the clock back.  And Griffiths thinks we should negotiate with them. For those who want to read this interesting book, rip out Chapters 14 and 15.  They don't make much sense, so why read those chapters.
