 I have read many stories from the Vietnam War and this is one of the better ones.  Jack does a good job of detailing his 77 days at Khe Sanh.  No wonder the Vietnam War scarred so many people at so young an age.  Jack is set down in Khe Sanh and the North Vietnamese Army targets the base day and night.  Marines get little sleep as rockets, mortars, and artillery are flung at them at odd hours.  Jack details his life during this 3-4 month ordeal.  Loss of friends, million dollar wounds, and the West Dickens street sign are just some of the stories told in this book. This is a great read.  I managed to read it in two days because of the easy flow and good stories.  Great job writing your first book Jack.
