 I liked this book by Andrew Wheatcroft.  In the introduction, he made it certain to the readerwhat he wasn't going to do, which was the entire history of the Ottaman Empire.  What he does is clear up some misconceptions about the old Turkish Empire, and how they related to developments in Western Europe.  If you want a defininitive book on the Turkish Empire, you should read Lord Kinross's The Ottoman Centuries or Palmer's book. Wheatcroft relates the images of the Lustful Turk, and discards those images into the trash can.  What emerges is a very conservative Islamic society trying to cope with the West and not being very successful at it.  The Sick Man of Europe did indeed die, but for the after effects read David Fromkin's A Peace to End All Peace.
