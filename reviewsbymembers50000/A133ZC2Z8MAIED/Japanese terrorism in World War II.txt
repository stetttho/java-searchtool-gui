 Rees explains the deviant behavior that arose in Japan after the first wars of the 20th Century (Russo-Japanese War, WWI).  In those conflicts, Japan immitated the Western Allies in their treatment of captured territories and POWs.  With the rise of nationalism in Japan, Japanese were taught to believe they were the favored race and others in Asia (Chinese) were just so many beasts.  With the war is China, Japanese soldiers took Chinese for bayonet practice.  Japanese doctors practiced difficult operations on Chinese who then died after their operations.  Women served as brothel material.  Rees lists examples of all these deadly proceedings. There are no surprises in Rees book.  He talks about the fire bombings of Japanese cities, rapes performed on Okinawain women and the shooting of Japanese POWs by the Americans.  The fire bombings and use of the atomic weapons on Japanese cities is all true.  I am also sure some surrendering Japanese POWs were killed as well as rape.  I doubt if this was widespread.  I guess Rees is trying to equate that all war has certain evil in it, but it takes away from his expose of the criminal behavior of the Japanese military.  This hurt the book. This is a short book of worthy material for the historian.  Be prepared to read some pretty disgusting material on cannibalism. His attacks on the Americans detracted from the book.
