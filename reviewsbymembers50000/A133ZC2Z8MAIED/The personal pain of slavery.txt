 Starobin takes a collection of letters and places them in book form to show the inhumanity of slavery.  Along with these letters, are short bits of history about slave families, the desire for liberty, emigration to Liberia, and slave insurrections.  Even though Starobin is a Marxist, this book shows the true nature of slavery and how it undermined both the slave masters and those in bondage. This book is very difficult to read, since most people in bondage were prevented from learning how to read and write.  The letters in the book are very difficult to read.  This is no fault of Starobin, he wants the reader to draw his own opinions. However, one can see the sufferings of those in bondage, and know the inhumanity of slavery.  I think this puts to rest people who say slavery benefited the black population by civilizing them.  One telling letter was by a freed slave writing to a white pastor and asking why the pastor preached to the white slave holding families and not the poor blacks outside.  The slave asks if it was because these white families had money, and the blacks none.  This slave had more sense than that pastor. A revealing book about the evils of slavery.
