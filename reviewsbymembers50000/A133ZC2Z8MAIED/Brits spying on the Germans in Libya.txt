 I generally love memoirs coming out about WWII.  Some of these stories give the true feeling of combat and comradeship of the soldiers of all nationalities.  With the number coming out of these stories, publishers feel there is money to be made from these.  However, some of these stories are more private and more suited to family members than others.  This story is one of them.  The author no doubt was a brave man with the Long Range Desert Group.  He commanded people spying on the German and Italian supply convoys going to the front.  However, the writing lags at time, and some chapters were difficult to go through.  Other details were of high interest.  Some parts of the book were just a mass of detail, as the author relates stories of these spying missions.  The editor even admitted it was difficult editing this personal memoir of the war in Libya.  There are some nice stories in this book, if one can go past some of the details.  I think this book has a lot of interest for the Timpson family, but maybe not for the general WWII reader.
