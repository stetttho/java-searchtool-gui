 As one of the previous reviewers describe, read Crassweller's book about Trujillo to really get a good picture of how awful this Dominican dictator was to his people.  For those interested in the assasination of the dictator, Diederich's book describes in minute detail of how the murder took place.  Crassweller's book leaves much of this out.  Trujillo was as bad to his people as Saddam is to the Iraqi people.    One good point of this book is the reader's knowledge that Diederich was there at the time in the country.  This is no author piecing something together from written sources, but a news correspondent covering the Dominican Republic during the time of the incident.  The book was very readable.
