 This is actually a good read, and I could have gone either way 3 to 4 stars.  Turnipseed makes this interesting reading, despite throwing in various quotes from philosophers.  I am not sure his fellow grunts understood him, and maybe I don't either.  His job as a reserve Marine was to drive trucks from the rear to near the front.  Most of his time was not spent in hazardous duty, despite the SCUDS and NBC threats.  What he had to do was routine duty, that most frontline soldiers would grab for.  Despite his duties, he makes this interesting reading by relating his experiences during the first Gulf War.  This is a fairly short read about the experiences of one soldier in war, and war for him was mostly in the rear.  His philosohical notions sometimes gets in the way of the read. I especially enjoyed his chapter on the black planet.
