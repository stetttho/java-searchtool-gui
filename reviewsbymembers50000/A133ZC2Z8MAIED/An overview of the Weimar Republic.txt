 Like the previous reviewer, this is an overview from several people's perspectives on the German Republic after William II and before Adolf Hitler.  Some parts of the book are interesting, but some are just boring--especially relating to the cultural and sexual revolution in Germany.  This is not an in depth study, so really it is just the cited sources perspective which could be right or wrong. De Jonge is a great author and his book on Rasputin flowed really well.  This book did not flow as well, but there is interesting material in here.  Those people's perspectives count in why Hitler rose to power.  The violence of Weimar as described in the book was a fairly new perspective. A worthwhile, short read on the Weimar Republic.
