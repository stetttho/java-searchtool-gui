 John Talbot does a good job reviewing the reason why this war was fought.  Algeria had been French since the early 1800s, and had a large settler population of one million.  These one million settlers thought of themselves as French, whereas the other eight million people resident in Algeria thought of themselves as Algerians.  Talbot describes the conflict between the FLN and the French Republic.  Also described was the conflict of the OSS with the French and Algerians. Good review of the government program of all four governments of the Fourth Republic, and DeGalle's progress in resolving the Algerian crisis. Talbot is a rather dry writer, so although this book was a good summary of the conflict, it was not a page turner.
