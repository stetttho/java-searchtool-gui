 I have to agree with most of the other reviewers in saying this was a so-so book on leadership.  Bennis tells a lot of stories about theories and tries to interweave leadership principles into these stories.  Perhaps I was looking too closely for some sort of theory and what I got was a lot of common sense to support the stories told.  For example, treat people the way you want to be treated, let people try things and even if they make mistakes, it benefits the organization.  I would hope most people would think these are common sense type suggestions. As other people reported, Bennis takes a lot of stories about the entertainment industry, feminist organizations, etc, and one wonders how strong these organization leadership abilities are.  Industry, military, and political organizations are perhaps better organizations to describe for leadership principles. An average read for those interested in management.
