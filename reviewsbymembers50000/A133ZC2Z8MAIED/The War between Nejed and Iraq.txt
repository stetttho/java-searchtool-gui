 Innocent Iraqis and British soldiers are killed by Moslem fundamentalists after they infiltrate the Iraq border.  This sounds familiar.  It is and history is repeating itself.  Sir John writes about his ten years on the border of Iraq and Saudi Arabia (Nejed).  Nejed fundamentalists (Ikhwan) are raiding the border tribes of Iraq and killing all the men.  These Ikhwan then plunder all these tribes have (mainly camels and sheep) and write it off as Holy War.  Well we call these people robbers and terrorists nowadays (not in the Middle East).  Glubb tells of how he organized the tribes to defend themselves against these terrorists.  His ten years of effort pay off when these Ikhwan irritate Ibn Saud.  Ibn Saud then organizes a campaign that dirves these cutthroats out of his country. This is an interesting read because of the similarities with today's conflict.  America is fighting fundamentalists infiltrating from Syria while Britain fought fundamentalists from Nejed.  Then the Iraq government was very weak, as it is today.  There are many other similarities.  This is a good book to read because of today's conflict.
