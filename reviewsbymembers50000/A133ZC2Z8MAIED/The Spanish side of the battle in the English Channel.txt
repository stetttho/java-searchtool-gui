 Howarth is a great story teller for historians.  In this book, he shows the Spanish side led by the Duke of Medina Sidonia.  The Duke was a very courageous though inexperienced sailor.  His commanders were also very able.  The problem was the campaign as formated by Philip II.  Philip micro managed but at the same time did not present what the ultimate objective was to be.  Would he name himself King of England?  One has to fill in the blanks, and Howarth does a good job of giving details of what Philip intended to do. Unlike others, Howarth details why the Spaniards were the underdog in this campaign.  The English ships were sleek and maneuverable, whereas the Spaniards were clumsy.  The numbers were not as great as one supposed.  All told, the Spanish were the underdogs since they were operating far from base.  The result were running battles, with the English besting the Spaniards.  On the trip around the isles, poor weather, lack of provisions, and unseaworthy vessels killed more than the battle itself.   Howarth does a great job in describing this agony of sailors and soldiers seeking home, but ultimately killed in Ireland.   The only wish for this book is that Howarth could have expanded his study.  This is an interesting subject, but the book was short.
