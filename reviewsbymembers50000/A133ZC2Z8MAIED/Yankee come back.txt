 A fascinating account of the war after the war in Indo China. Chanda gives us a wonderful review of the participants on the Vietnamese, Chinese, Cambodian, and American sides.  When South Vietnam and Cambodia fell to the Communists in 1975, Americans in general and the government in particular closed the book on this awful period in American history.  The Vietnamese were gulled into thinking that after their violations of the ceasefire, they were entitled to billions of dollars for rebuilding their shattered economy.  Instead they got nothing and selected the Soviets as sponsers.  This presented a problem to the Chinese who went to the Khymer Rouge as their proxy.  As a result, war followed the war.  Cambodia was shattered by first American bombing, then the Khymer Rouge terror and finally the war with Vietnam.  Both the Chinese and Vietnamese wanted the Americans to come back and serve a role. Nayan Chanda does an excellent and even handed job of presenting the views of all the participants.  This is a wonderful book to read if you are interested in geopolitics.  At 500 some odd pages, this book will take some time to read.
