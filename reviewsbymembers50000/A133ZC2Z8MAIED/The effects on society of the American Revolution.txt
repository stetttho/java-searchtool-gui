 A good book about the American Revolution.  If people are reading this book for the military history, they should not since this is not Mr. Wood's intent.  The battles are summarized, but the book mainly details the effects on American society of the Revolution.  Wood gives us a good idea why the Revolution took place, and the result of the Revolution.  America matured as a result of this conflict, but not all issues were settled (as in the case of slavery). This is my fourth book which I have read in this series.  They are all solid books and give the reader an idea why this event had so much impact on World History.  Even though these books are short, they still pack a lot of information into them.
