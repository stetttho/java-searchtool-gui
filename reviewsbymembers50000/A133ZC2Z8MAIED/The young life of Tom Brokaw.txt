 I can relate to this book.  My parents lived through the Depression and raised their children in the prosperous sixties and seventies.  They live in northern Wisconsin where most of the population was white.  The similarites with Brokaw's South Dakota is basically the same.  As a product of the Midwest, Brokaw is more similar to me than Rather (Texas) or Jennings (Canada). I enjoyed this simple story.  Tom relates how he made it in televison journalism and New York.  Despite where he lives now, he considers himself at home in South Dakota rather than New York.  Tom chronicles his early life and relates how and where he was raised even now determine his outlook on life.  I feel the same way and that is why this book struck home.  I would rather tramp the forests of northern Wisconsin than see the lights of Chicago.  People make their way in life in some measure because of who they were born to and where they lived.  Tom's rural life and his parents survival of the Depression determined a lot of what Tom eventually turned out to be.  A great story.
