 This is a good book and I am surprised the authors have not had more books after this one.  On the dust cover, they compare this to Alive.  Even though this book is every bit as interesting, I believe the frequency of jumbo jets crashing has made people immune to this type of story. The story is about an Eastern Airlines L-1011 crashing in the Everglades late in December, 1972.  The pilots basically let the auto pilot fly the plane in the ground with the death toll at 103 persons.  Several little problems resulted in a new jumbo jet being crashed.  First two little light bulbs costing $12.00 were not functioning.  The pilots concern over this resulted in them losing focus on landing the aircraft and concentrate on reinstalling the light fixture.  The chief pilot had a brain tumor which may have impaired his vision.  Another airliner problem at Miami caused the air traffic controllers to focus their attention elsewhere.  What happened is that the plane flew itself into the ground. I have seen a movie on this book.  An interesting aside is that purportly some of the L-1011's equipment was salvaged and used in other aircraft.  This caused some hauntings on other EAL     L-1011s.  I don't know if this is true, but the authors do not refer to this in this book.  This is a good read about the airline industry.  I wouldn't read it on a plane though.  The airline industry is indeed susceptable to human weakness, as this book points out.
