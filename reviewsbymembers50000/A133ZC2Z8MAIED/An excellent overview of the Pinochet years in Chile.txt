 There has been a lot of trash written about Pinochet, but this book along with Soldiers in a Narrow Land have a very balanced perspective.  As the title states, there were both supporters of Pinochet and the Armed Forces, and there were opponents.  Allende was not skillful in leading his country through the changes of the seventies, so a ruluctant Pinochet and the Armed Forces removed him.  The excesses of the reign of terror following the coup de etat are unforgiveable, but one should remember that in Argentina the dirty war killed close to twenty thousand, where Chile's coup and terror killed 3,000. The authors do a great job describing the successes and failures of the Pinochet regime.  Also a good description of the power struggles within the Armed Forces themselves (Air Force versus Army).  The one thing needing improvement in this book is an update on what has since happened in Chile. Since I am marrying a Chilean, I found this book a great way to know more about this country.  It describes the still powerful emotion in Chile over Pinochet (positive and negative).
