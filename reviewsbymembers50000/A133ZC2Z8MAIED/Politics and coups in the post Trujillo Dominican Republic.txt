 I have read some of Kurzman's latter writings, so I was surprised by this old book about the politics of the Dominican Republic.  Kurzman details the fall of the first democratically elected President of the Dominican Republic Juan Bosch and the American military intervention in 1965.  Kurzman goes into great detail about the political situation in the Dominican Republic, so this is perhaps not the best book for the novice reader. One can get an idea on the difficulty in imposing a free election system into a land which never knew this form of government (similar to Iraq today).  The United States faced this difficulty in the Dominican Republic in the early sixties, as now it faces it in Iraq.  The transition was not easy in the Dominican Republic, as I am sure it will be difficult in the Iraq. The Americans intervened in the Dominican Republic because it feared the Communists were taking over the government.  Kurzman details in this book that very few Communists were in the revolt.  People supported Juan Bosch and not the Communists.  The Communists had been corrupted by the Trujillo dictatorship.   Altogether a good book about the DR and the difficult politics of this country during its crisis years.
