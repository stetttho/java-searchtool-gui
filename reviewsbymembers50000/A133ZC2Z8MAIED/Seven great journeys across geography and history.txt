 For those readers interested in both history and geography, this book should be of interest to them.  Great journeys is a BBC production and the seven writers describe their journeys, with differing opinions and viewpoints.  The seven journeys are:  1) the Silk Road, 2) the Polynesian Triangle, 3) the Pan American Highway, 4) the Burma Road, 5) the Baltic to the Black Sea, 6) the Salt Road, and 7) the Ho Chi Minh Trail.  Terrific writing by all the writers, although I can't say I agree with all their viewpoints.  This is especially the case with Philip Jones Griffiths who wrote about the Ho Chi Minh trail.  I found him too guilible to the Communist cause.
