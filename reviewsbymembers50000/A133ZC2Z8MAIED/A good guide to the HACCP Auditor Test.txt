 I bought this book to give me some understanding of how to pass ASQ's HACCP Auditor test.  Even though this book is somewhat short, it had enough good information to make me pass this test in October 2005.  HACCP stands for Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point and is meant for food safety.  For those who work in the food industry, or even those who provide products to the food industry, HACCP is needed to ensure the safety of our food supply.  This book is a general overview of HACCP and is not meant for any specific industry.  However, those who read it was understand the context of what to do in setting up a HACCP program in their specific business.  This is a nice informative book about HACCP.  Shoppers should understand that AMAZON gives lower prices than those of member discounted ASQ's book division.  Buy your ASQ books through Amazon because it is cheaper.
