 What a convenient book to come out with the U.S.'s sputtering effort in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Algeria was indeed a difficult country to subdue for the French and their effort was ultimately unsuccessful.  The FLN engaged in terrorist acts to demonstrate their capability to the world.  How do you combat people ready to kill easy civilian targets, rather than tough military and political targets.  The only proven way is to fight terror with counter terror and make the terrorists pay such a high price that is not worth it.  This is what the author demonstrates with his relation to the counter terror struggle. The author throws in way too many names in his zeal to show how the government was complicit in the killing of 3,000 terrorists. Since he was acting under orders, it was interesting to hear how top government officials wished that an FLN leader would commit suicide and the next day it would happen.  The author was responsible for these deaths.  Those killed happened to also have killed others.  The problem is who determines who dies.  The terrorist does not make any distinction.  Civilized society needs to have a standard for this determination or they are as bad as the terrorists.
