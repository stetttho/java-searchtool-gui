 I admire what the Israelis did when an Air France airliner was hijacked by Palestinian and German terrorists in 1976.  In a short time, they opened communications with the terrorists and plotted a raid to secure the hostage's release.  This is an inspirational story of Rabin, Peres and Netanyahu and how they battled the dark forces of Amin and the PFLP terrorists.  The solution to terrorism is to deal with what terrorists understand and that is force. This is a nice read that details the terrorism Israel has faced from her beginning to 1976.  One can understand why Israel reacts the way she does when there is constant terror on innocent civilians in her country.  Israel has become a tough country because so many of her people have been killed because of Arab terrorism.  This is also an inspirational story of Yoni Netanyahu and how he traded his life to free the Air France hostages.
