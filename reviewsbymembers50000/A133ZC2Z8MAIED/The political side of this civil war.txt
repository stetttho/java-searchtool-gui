 I have read a number of books on this war, and surprisingly few have covered the political aspect as well as this book.  The other books have reviewed the military aspects of the war, and spent a short summary on the political part of the war.  This book is different.  It went into great detail about the POUM, Carlists, Anarchists, Left Republicans, Socialists, Monarchists, etc.  After reading this book, I now know where these groupings came about and what they believed in.  This is a very good review of the political history of the Spanish Republic.  As for the military side, very little time or pages were spent on the battles. This book is a nice read and has many great pictures.  When reading it, it was a little distracting to read about one subject, and then find another topic covered.  The author could have made the material have a better flow.  Subjects changed even in the middle of a paragraph.  I never saw that in other historical books.  For this reason, I rated it only four stars.
