 This is a great read.  I read this book in less than 24 hours because it was so interesting.  Michel did a great job of detailing the Christmas bombing campaign of 1972.  The B-52s (or BUFFs)were sent to take the war to the North Vietnamese.  The target was Hanoi and Haiphong.  The campaign covered only 11 days.  THe North Vietnamese and their SA-2s and Fan Song radar shot down 15 BUFFs.   What is so interesting is how the SAC generals made lots of mistakes and then covered them up.  The centralized approach to the war by SAC sounded like they were imitating Soviet generals.  This centralized approach had a lot to do with how SAC was structured.  Also interesting was the sharp turn following the bombing run.  The bomber crews did this because we always did it this way.  However this turn made the radar jamming inoperable during this activity.  The first four nights of the bombing run were predictable and it was like a line of ants going to a picnic.  The North Vietnamese practiced their skill at lining the missles up and shooting at the opportune time.  The lack of missles was the only thing preventing more losses to the USAF BUFFs. General Sullivan commanding the Thailand base was the only one who voiced his opinion of these bad tactics.  Once the losses were high, his voice was heard. He was subsequently put on the slow track and later retired.  This is a good book.  Lots of great information on this last battle of the Vietnam War.  The one thing distracting about this book is the poor grammar used throughout it.  This book needed a good proof reader and unfornately this was not done well.  However, the information and story within this book more than made up for this deficit.
