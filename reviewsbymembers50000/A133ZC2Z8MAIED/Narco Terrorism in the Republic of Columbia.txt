 Even though the author is a liberal human rights activist, she makes plenty of strong points in this book.  The civil war in Columbia in which the U.S. is supporting the Columbian Army in profoundly complicating the civil society in Columbia.  The West's drug habits are also altering Columbian society.  Both the right wing paramilitaries and the left wing guerrillas are perverting Columbia into a violent society.  This society has more deaths per 1,000 than any inner city in America.  This violent society also makes its way onto the news reports, where massacres and killings are reported as if it was the weather.  Columbia is a violent society and America is not making it easier to calm this troubled state.  That said, there are few suggestions the author has for calming this troubled society, other than that human rights should be respected.  Since neither side respects these human rights, violence increases every year.  The rebels/Army/paramilitaries/narcs are all portrayed as bad guys in this book.  Children become killers.  Nonviolent people are disappeared.  There are no good suggestions on how to end the violence.  The guerrillas disperse gas cyclinder bombs onto civilian targets.  The AUC uses chain saws to cut people up.  Everybody profits by selling cocaine and heroin to the West.  I don't know if there is any cure.  I am not sure a FARC-UP win would change anything in this society.    This is a good book to read about Columbia.  I visited the country once and thought the people were beautiful and charming.  However the hotel personnel wore bullet proof vests, and garage attendants were scanning parked cars for bombs.  Fortunaley I never left Sante Fe de Bogota, and so did not see the countryside.  I think the author correctly portrays the country as a troubled society.
