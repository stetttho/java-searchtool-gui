 Howard is a great historian and he manages to boil the First World War down to 135 pages.  This is an informative work for those who do not have the time to invest in a more detailed book. It breaks down the war into an introduction, and the years of the war, plus the results of the war.  If one is looking for specific information about battles, then this is not the book for the reader.   As Howard relates in his introduction, there is still a lot of controversy about some aspects of the war.  Howard relates the most popular versions, but the reader can still chose to second guess.  This is good starter book for those interested in the First World War.
