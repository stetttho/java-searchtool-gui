 Unlike what some of the previous reviewers have said, this book is not a complete disaster and it is certainly better that watching paint dry.  Dr. Pleshakov could have given us a better balanced view of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 by viewing the Japanese side.  Also more material thrown in about the siege of Port Arthur as good background before the Second Pacific Squadron put to sea.  The reasons for the war were rather simplistic, so this could have been improved.  I think the editing was horrible, especially when referring to the Russian and English (Bear and Lion, not Bear and Whale)conflict.  This could have been a much better read, but the author focused on the Squardron's stay in Madagascar and Indochina, rather than the reasons for the war, the siege of Port Arthur, and the battle itself.
