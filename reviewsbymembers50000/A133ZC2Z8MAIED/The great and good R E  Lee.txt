 There are few people who impress me in history.  Robert E. Lee is the exception.  Not only was this a wonderfully, kind man who was trained as a soldier and engineer, he was brillant in many other areas.  He disliked slavery, even though he had some inherited slaves.  He felt loyalty to his native state of Virginia and fought for her.  He was a great administrator of several educational institutions (West Point, Washington and Lee College).  He hated war but fought for his native land.  This is perhaps why Americans still revere him when other CSA Generals and politicians don't merit the same praise.  This short book has selected  writings from either Lee, his family, or his associates. This is a ninety page large picture book.  It is packed with information, but it is short.  There are longer books out there on Robert E. Lee.
