 Iris Origo is an Anglo American woman married to an Italian called Alberto Origo.  She settles in the rural Italian countryside of Tuscany.  Her husband is a prominent landowner in a small valley.  When Italy gets involved in World War II, Iris keeps a small diary.  In the book 1943 and 1944 are revealed as hardship years for the Italian people.  Food is scarce, and airplanes are indiscriminate in attacks on civilians and soldiers.  What is worse are the Fascists who have become vicious in the face of a sullen people.  Origo describes how her and her family managed during these most difficult times.  I feel this book is a good read for those who want to discover how a civilian population copes with war.
