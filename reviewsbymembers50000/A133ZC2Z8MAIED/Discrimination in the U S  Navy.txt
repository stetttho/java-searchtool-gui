 I give Allen credit for writing about a little known event in our nation's and WWII history.  This was the explosion caused by the mishandling of ammunition at the Port Chicago Naval Station in California.  Over 300 people died as a result of this explosion, the majority of them black ammunition handlers.  When the Navy tried to redirect the remaining black ammunition handlers to another yard, they refused to handle any more ammunition.  If I were them, I would too.  The Navy then selected a representative 50 of the 250 soldiers who refused to handle any more ammunition, and court martialed them with long prison sentences.  That was injustice. This is an interesting story.  However, Allen's leftist rantings tended to alienate the reader from the story.  Bob, most people agree that what the U.S. Navy did to these 50 sailors was wrong, but why slant the story so radically.  Allen's writings was not as smooth as most writers, so I tended to slog through this very interesting story.  The story could have been better written and the slant should have been left out.  More detail about the explosion could also have been included in this short book, without slighting the main theme of discrimination of the U.S. Navy.
