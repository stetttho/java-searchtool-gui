 I disagree with the previous two reviewers on this book.  At best, this is only an average read.  The author and main character in this book, Major Phil Ashby was one of the youngest majors in the British Army when he assigned to the UN Peace Force in the African nation of Sierra Leone.  I expected to read a long book about the conflict in Sierra Leone, but clearly half of this book was about the author's experience in his physical conditioning in the Royal Marines.  After a hundred pages, one gets the idea this guy is tough.  Then he details his experiences in Sierra Leone and his escape from the brutal RUF rebel faction who controlled the diamond mining area.  This part was the most interesting. I felt the author could have devoted a chapter to an explanation of the different factions in Sierra Leone and why they are fighting.  A little history of this nation would also have been nice to throw in.  A little more of this info, and a little less of his physical exploits would have made this book a more interesting read.
