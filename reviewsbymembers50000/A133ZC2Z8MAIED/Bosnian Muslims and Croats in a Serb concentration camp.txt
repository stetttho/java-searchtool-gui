 The author Rezak Hukanovic is a Bosnian Muslim living in a small city of Prijedor.  As the country Yugoslavia breaks apart, an independent republic Bosnia emerges.  The Serbs act on this and take over some cities such as Prijedor.  The Serbs round up the Muslim and Croat males and put them in concentration camps.  Even though Rezak has some friends who are Serbs and he is apolitical, he is put in the same camp as all the others. First the Serbs rob them of their possessions.  Then they rob them of their humanity.  The Serbs torture and execute their victims, even though they knew them in a prior life.  Rezak details all these dispictable crimes committed on the Muslims and Croats.  Even though humanity stated never again after the killing of the Jews in WWII, Rezak details that most of humanity just stood and watched what happened in Bosnia to the Muslims and Croats.  This is a good short read.
