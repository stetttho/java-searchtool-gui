 How does war affect people.  If you read Zlata's Diary, you will find out how war has affected a little girl.  Her friends move away, one friend is shot, and there is the lack of electricity, food, and water.  She notices that her parents visibly age as the war progresses.  Everybody is under tremendous pressure.  She spends many days couped up in her apartment without seeing daylight.  Snipers shoot into her bedroom making it unsafe.  This is the sad fact of war and how it affects civilians.  Zlata shows the world the inhumanity of warfare and its affects on children. One thing not talked about is who Zlata is...Muslim, Serb, Croat.  I know the reason why this was left out.  It was to show the effects of war on children regardless of enthicity.  Other than the reader's curiousity on this, this is a sad story on what warfare really does to people.
