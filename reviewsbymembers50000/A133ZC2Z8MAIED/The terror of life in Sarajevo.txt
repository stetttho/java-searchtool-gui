 Dizdarevic does a good job of showing the terror of everyday life in Sarajevo.  What struck me about this book is how the population slowly accomodated itself to random shootings and starvation.  As the population adjusted itself, you can feel the anger welling up inside the author against the world leaders and the UN.  UN troops sat around and did nothing.  These troops were Canadians and French who watched Serb troops shoot down innocent civilians.  When the Bosnians tried to defend themselves, these same UN troops issued veiled threats against these defenses.  It just goes to show the spineless foreign policy of the UN and those who provide troops for these peace keeping missions. The reader can feel the anger of the author for the war criminals who terrorized the civilians of Sarajevo.  These criminals (Ratko Mladic, Zivota Panic, Vojislav Seselj, Radovan Karadzic).  The U.S. needs to bring these criminals to justice. The reason why I rated this only a four star is because of the introduction by New York Times writer Robert Jay Lifton.  Lifton provides us with an introduction where he equates the nuclear weapons policy of the U.S. with genocide.  This is typical liberal drivel.  This book would have been better without Lifton's crap in it.  That said, the book was a good read about man's inhumanity to man.
