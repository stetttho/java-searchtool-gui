 This is the third book I have read written by Richard Hough.  They are all good books, and Hough has a way with describing naval battles.  In this book, he describes how the Russian Admiralty collected four good battleships and a motley collection of other ships to lead into the battle with the Japanese.  This 10,000 mile journey across half of the world ended in defeat at Tushuma (Donkey's Ears).  Hough describes how the failure of the Admiralty, the ship's crews, and the Admiral resulted in one of the most stunning defeats in naval history.  There is plenty of blame to go around.  Several thousand Russian sailors died as a result.   I agree with some of the other reviewers that more of the writing should have been devoted to the actual battle.  In itself, the travel of the Second Pacific fleet was also a naval accomplishment.  For a latter and more detailed book of the battle, see The Tsar's Last Armada.
