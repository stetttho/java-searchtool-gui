 As a couple of the previous reviewers have noted, this was supposed to be a good short read of the Balkans.  Unfortunately, it was dry, dry, dry.  The author loves to throw in a lot of ten dollar words in this thesis about the Balkans.  One wonders what his ultimate purpose was in writing this book.   I picked up a few themes from his book.  One was that Ottomon Empire and the some of the Communist regimes papered over the ethnic differences.  At the same time, the ethnic differences were not a big deal for most of the time in the Balkans.  Neither were the religious differences, as the population tended to chose what parts of the various practices to follow.   For me, this was not a particularly interesting read.  At slighty over a hundred pages, one would assume you could breeze through this book.  But the writing and the words used, resulted in me taking six and a half hours to read this book.  There are more interesting books out there including Misha Glenny with his The Balkans.  I would probably consult that book if I wanted information.
