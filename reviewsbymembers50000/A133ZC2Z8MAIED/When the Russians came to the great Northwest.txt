 This is a very short book about the Russian exploration effort in Washington and Oregon.  The Russians were exploring this area to see if there was a wealth of fur bearing animals.  Their merchandise was shoddy, and few Indians wanted to trade for this.  The Sv. Nikolai then was stranded on a beach in a storm.  The crew escaped with some weapons, but few provisions.  Then began the journey into poverty and want and then slavery for the crew.  Some Indians were merciful, and treated their captives kindly.  Some did not.  Twenty of the crew were eventually rescued when an American in Russian employ ransomed them.  The editor tells this tale from two perspectives.  First, he starts with the Russian perspective, and then an oral tale from the Indians who captured the Russian crew.  This is not exciting reading.  It did show the rivalry of Great Britain, Russia, Spain and the United States for this valuable area.  This is an OK read for those interested in early European exploration.
