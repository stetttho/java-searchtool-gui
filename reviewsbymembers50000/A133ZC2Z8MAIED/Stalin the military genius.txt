 Another good book by Pleshakov.  This book details the first ten days of the German/Russian War in World War Two.  Pleshakov provides a convincing reason why the Russians suffered great defeats in the first ten days.  Stalin wanted an offensive war to take out Eastern Europe and stationed troops right at the border.  Unfortunately, Hitler struck first and devastrated Stalin's Army and Air Force.  Then Stalin wanted an offensive to push the Germans back and in reality lost several armies because of his lack of military knowledge.  Stalin may have had great political skills, but he was no military genius.  His decisions cost the Soviets several million men in the first ten days of the war.  This is a nice quick read about the first ten days of the war.  I learned something about why the Soviets suffered so much at the beginning of the war.  The author's theory about the Stalin's offensive strategy explains much of why the Soviet Union did so poorly at the beginning of this conflict.
