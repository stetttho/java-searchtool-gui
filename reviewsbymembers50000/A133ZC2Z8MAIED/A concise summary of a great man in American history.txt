 Keneally may not be as exalted a writer as others who have written about our greatest President, but he does a good job summarizing Abraham Lincoln.  At approximately 150 pages, the reader learns about Lincoln's early heritage and the political and military battles of his Presidency.  This is basic stuff, so if a reader needs more details, consult some of the other fine books on Lincoln. I find some of the info about Lincoln somewhat in doubt.  First Keneally states Lincoln may have had a sexual disease.  I have read some on Lincoln, but I never found that in other references.  Perhaps I missed that somewhere.  Also in doubt is Lincoln's paternity where Tom Lincoln was not the father of Abraham.  Keneally dismisses that but should we include that in a short biography of this famous man. Overall a good concise read on our most famous President.  Readers who desire the basics on this man will do well to read this book.
