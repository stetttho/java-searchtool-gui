 Another book that tackles the subject of who lost Atlanta.  Joe Johnson certainly set the stage by retreating and not seriously contesting Sherman's movements toward one of the South's largest cities.  Johnson thought Sherman would charge his entrenched positions, and Sherman had no desire to take thousands of casualties.  So the move toward Atlanta was one of feints and flanking movements which resulted in Sherman moving closer to Atlanta and Johnson giving up valuable real estate.  This is a nicer book than Atlanta will Fall, because it is less harsh on Joe Johnson. It is charitable to both Johnson and Hood, although it does point the finger at both for losing Atlanta.  Hood is depicted as a cavilier soldier who aggressiveness would result in thousands of Army of Tennessee soldiers deaths.  This is a short read, and although a little revisionist, it backs its arguments up with solid facts, as noted in the Appendixes.  A good, solid read about Sherman's drive to Atlanta.
