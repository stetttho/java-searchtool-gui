 A short summary of good tips on becoming valuable to your employer.  Somervill outlines a number of ways to become a better employee through self improvement.  She also cautions people to find the job they are most interested in, rather than fight it out in some job you don't care for.  The text of the book is that by becoming more valuable to your employer, you can improve both your job and yourself.  Somervill also states that employees need to be true to themselves, since in today's marketplace, employers regularly discard workers.  Those who seek to improve themselves will always be more marketable in the long run.   I found this book a very practical read.  For those who need suggestions on how to improve their jobs and themselves, this is a good starting point.
