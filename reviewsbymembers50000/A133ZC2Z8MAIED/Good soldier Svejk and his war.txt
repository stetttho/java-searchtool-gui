 Twenty years ago this was required reading for my East European history course, and I have to say it is not only a classic but a great read.  My Professor (an exile Latvian) wanted us students to know the reason why Eastern Europeans acted the way they acted.  After being dominated by major great powers, East Europeans became docile in the face of power.  Good soldier Svejk not only exhibits this with both the Austro-Hungarians, but also the Russians.  Svejk accomodates himself to the realities of his life by acceptance outwardly, but resists internally the controls placed on him. This is a great read for those trying to understand East Europe. It is also a humorous read.  Even now I chuckle over the actions of Good Soldier Svejk.
