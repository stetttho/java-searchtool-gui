 This is a hard read for such a short book.  The subject matter in these essays show how the provicials (Jefferson, Franklin, Madison, Hamilton) created a new world order with their ideas and writings.  Such writings as the Federalist papers are now more quoted today than they were when they were created.  These ideas revolutionized how other countries changed their societies.  That is the essence of this book.   Bailyn describes these ideas in this short book.  The concepts are good in terms of how the founders poured the foundations which the United States stands on today.  What is missing is how other events (the American and French Revolutions) also changed the Atlantic states.  Ideas can help change societies, but force and political power have more relevance in change. I would not suggest this book to the average reader interested in the American Revolution.  These concepts are perhaps too deep for the average reader.  Bailyn is writing for the academic audience.
