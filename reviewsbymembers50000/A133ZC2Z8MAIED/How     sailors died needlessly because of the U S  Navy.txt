 Before the loss of the U.S.S. Indy, there was the U.S.S. Juneau. The Navy performed in the same poor manner in regards to the  rescue of the 150 survivors, after this light cruiser blew up after being torpedoed.  The result was sailors left in the water or on rafts being seen by airmen flying over the wreckage site. The airmen reported the siting of survivors, and reports were filed by no action resulted in the survivors being rescued.  The result were 140 sailors dying due to the negligence of the U.S. Navy.  Among the dead were two Rogers brothers and the five Sullivans.  This was one of the U.S. Navy's worst disasters.
