 A previous reviewer stated this correctly--this is a slight history.  There is not much meat in this book, although it describes the massacres as meat shops.  This is sad because the author is accomplished and this is a subject that many Americans are not familiar with.  The author could have made this a better book but maybe he didn't think it was worth the time or money.  The subject of the book are six massacres in the American West.  Five of these massacres had Indians as the victims and one was against a wagon train of immigrants.  Who was responsible--the American settlers of the West and the American government.  The author gives a very BRIEF history of each incident, and then tells us how horrible it was.  I believe these were horrible events and that is why they need a more thorough research than what the author provided.  That is where there needs to be a more telling story line.    This could have been a great book, but as such it is just a mere summary of some very troubled periods in the history of the American West.
