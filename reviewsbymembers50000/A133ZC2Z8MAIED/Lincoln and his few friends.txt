 This was an interesting book.  Every historian has a favorite story about one of the greatest American presidents-Abraham Lincoln.  He talked plain, told funny stories, and acted like a relative of the family.  However, Lincoln had few friends in his life.  You can actually count the number on a pair of hands.  The reason was Lincoln's upbringing in very isolated areas of Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky.  The death of his mother at an early age also stunted his development.  Except for two individuals (Speed and Herndon), Lincoln had few long term friends.  Professor Donald goes into all the close friends Lincoln had.  He examines the relationship with Speed, and lays the fact that Lincoln had a really close relationship with Speed.  He also examines his relationship with Browning, Herndon, Seward, his two presidential aides, and a bodyguard.  Many others may have known Lincoln, but few knew him in a personal way.  Lincoln was a very lonely man with plenty of burdens on him.  It is a wonder he managed to guide the country through the Civil War without many personal relationships.  Donald examines all of Lincoln's close personal relationships.  He disputes the present accusations that Lincoln was gay with good historical facts.  This is a good read for those interested in the Civil War.
