 Prof. Stone has a great book on the war in the east durning  World War I.  Since this book was written in 1974, it might not take in all the current details coming out of the former Soviet Union.  In the book, Stone refutes some of the common perceptions of this war.  The ultimate reason for their defeat was not an unwillingness to fight the war, but the incompetent leadership- both political and military- in the waging of the war.  In some cases sush as Brusilov, the leadership was very good and nearly suceeded in knocking the Austro-Hungarians out of the war.  This is probably the only book so far on this part of the war.
