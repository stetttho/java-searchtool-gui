 Poor Faye Resnick.  I really feel sorry for this lady.  It must be a hard life, being a Beaverly Hills socialite. At what restaurant do we eat?  Who do we have affairs with?  Can we go to Cabo San Lucos next week?  Such are the mighty questions Faye asks in her book.  All that stress must have forced the breakdown of her marriages and the cocaine and alcohol habits. As the previous reviewers have already noted, there is not much sympathy for this kind of lifestyle.  I read this book for the simple fact of gaining some insight into Nicole's husband.  O.J. is indeed a great actor.  His facade has masked what he really is.  In this, the book suceeds in giving some glimpses of a very troubled person.  At the same time, it gives a poor view of the lifestyles of the rich and idle.
