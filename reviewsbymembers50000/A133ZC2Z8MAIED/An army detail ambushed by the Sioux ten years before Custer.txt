 The Fetterman Massacre occurred right after the Civil War. On the Montana Road, the commander Colonel Carrington was  detailed to build and staff three forts in Montana and  Wyoming.  The Sioux and other Indian tribes led by Red Cloud laid seige to the forts.  The Indians laid a trap and when one Captain Fetterman went beyond his orders, he and his troops were killed and their bodies mutilated.   Dee Brown doesn't paint a pretty picture of the Army's decision to blaim Carrington or the Indian habit of butchering people. The only one who comes out positively is Colonel Carrington. I would agree with the earlier reviewer that the book starts out slowly, but it builds toward the climax of the battle and the  aftermath.
