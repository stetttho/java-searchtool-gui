 At the outset of WWI, the British used some of the large passenger liners as auxillary cruisers.  The Germans did the same, but were not as organized as the British.  This book is about the fight between two of these armed vessels.  The British represented by the Carmania was rapidly converted to war use by the addition of guns.  The German Cap Tradalgar was converted using the guns of an old gunboat.  Both made themselves look like the other, and when they finally met, the Germans were bested simply because their opponent had more guns.  The German ship sank, and the Carmania averted sinking only through diligent action by the crew members. Simpson does a good job of detailing the conflict between these two opponents.  This probably was not an epic battle, and it determined nothing toward the final outcome of the war.  It was a battle between two big ocean liners.  The story was well told.
