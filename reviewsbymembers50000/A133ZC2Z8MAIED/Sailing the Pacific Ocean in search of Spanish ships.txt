 The cover of this book compares it to the Endurance.  Well, I disagree.  This is a very enjoyable read, and the adventure is certainly there but this book only rates 3 1/2 stars for me.  First of all the author tries to rate the commander of the Speedwell and he is a difficult character to rate.  He is a master sailor, but he also usurps the authority of his commander and the owners.  As time has passed, he has become respectable whereas some of the other characters are termed felons, mutineers, and socialists.  Since this happened way back in the 1719-1720 period, it is hard to get a good handle on all the personalities from the ship. As stated, the adventure is certainly in this book.  These British seamen were all privateers wanting the partake of the riches of the Spanish Main.  They raided ships and wrecked their own ship.  They were marooned on an island where they constructed a ship to escape.  After several more captures of Spanish ships, they sailed across the Pacific in a worn out vessel and eventually some of the crew returned to Great Britain. This was the best part of the read.  The reader will gain a little history of sailor's living conditions during this time and the Great Power politics of Great Britain, Spain, and France.
