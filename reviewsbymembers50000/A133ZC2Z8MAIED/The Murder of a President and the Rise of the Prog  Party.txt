 This is an interesting book just for the examination of the assassination of President McKinley.  Rauchway details the shooting of McKinley and the aftermath.  The aftermath was the trial and execution of Leon Czolgosz, the war on anarchism and the rise of the Progressives (Roosevelt and Wilson).  During this short book, I read of the history of the social and political movement at the turn of the last century.  The political legacy was of conservative Republicans allied with big business and capital, with an arch conservative judicial system. McKinley's assassination caused the rise of a different force in the Republican Party.  Roosevelt made the Progressives respectable and caused changes in the political process which modernized the political, social, and economic landscape.  The final portion deals with the assassination attempt on Roosevelt in 1912 which was a reaction to all that Roosevelt accomplished. The assassination of McKinley focused negative press on the Anarchists, and the attempt in 1912 was a reaction to the Progressive policies of 1912. This is a good read.  The only criticism I have is that this book focuses much attention on the human element of one assassin.
