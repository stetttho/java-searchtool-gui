 I live two hours away from Cherry and before this book I really didn't know about this terrible disaster that occured here.  Thanks to Tintori's book, I now know about one of the most deadliest mine disasters in U.S. history.  This disaster caused the government to create the U.S. Mine Bureau to safe guard future miners.  In this disaster, two hundred thirty five miners were killed when this coal mine caught fire.  The reason it caught fire was the tardiness of clerks to purchase electrical wire for the complete mine.  When the mine relied on lanterns, one of the lanterns caused a bale of hay to catch fire.  The fire then jumped from the hay to the timbers and coal in the mine creating a huge blaze.  Over 200 + miners were caught below ground.  One week later, 21 were rescued and the other 235 perished.  The town of Cherry was literally a town of widows and orphans.  Tintori does a great job detailing the sadness of loss in Cherry. Tintori is the descendant of one of those miners who made it out.  I thought she did a great job of detailing those sad,heart felt moments when women and children found out they would never see their father or husband again.  This is a good read about a terrible disaster.
