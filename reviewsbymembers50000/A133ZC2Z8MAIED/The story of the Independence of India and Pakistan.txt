 This is a great read for those interested in the history of the Third World.  India and Pakistan are countries with huge populations and their independence in 1947 was one of turning points in the decolonization of the Third World.  Collins and Lapierre detail this story in this book.  Also detailed are the four people most important in the independence:  Montbatten, Gandhi, Nehru, and Jinnah.  Millions may have lost their life in the Punjab, but it would have been a far bloodier story if these people were not around.  Focus is given on Gandhi who was a most unselfish person, in recognizing the rights of all faiths.  The book details how Gandhi's struggles lead to the independence of India, and how the leaders of the different faiths broke the country up into Pakistan and India.  The last part of the book is the story of the assassination of Gandhi by Hindu fanatics. This is a great read.  At a little over 500 pages, this book will take some time to digest, but it is one of the best books about the independence struggle of Pakistan and India.  This book also sheds some light on the current problems with Kashmir. A great read.
