 This is an unusual book in that the author was a rez agent working for Eastern Airlines during the late eighties and early nineties.  She describes the self destruction of the airline from a pro-union perspective. Even though rez agents were not contract, Texas Air laid most of them off three or four days into the strike.  Her book describes the union struggle with Texas Air over the corpse of Eastern Airlines. I could have easily rated this book a two star.  All the letters are capital and this means the author is yelling at the reader.  There are no chapters, and the author just rants on of her hatred of Lorenzo, Bates, and Texas Air and her love of Eastern Airlines.  This is not a balanced picture of the decline of Eastern Airlines but a pro union argument about the evils of Lorenzo.  She even states that Texas Air's takeover of EA was equal to the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.  Joannie, you are over reaching here.  Calm down. The author comments are probably mostly correct about Lorenzo and Texas Air. Eastern Airlines had its share of problems prior to Texas Air, but it was a sad loss to the nation with the demise of this carrier.
