 As most of you know, the airline business was deregulated in the 1970s and 1980s.  Capitalism provided us with cheap fares and an abundance of flights.  In this book, Captain X fills people in on the unintended effects of deregulation.  These effects would be such things as snarly passengers from the lower rungs of society, crowded planes, frills cut back, worn down aircraft to transport these passengers, and other items.  Captain X also fills you in on the airline biz, and how it has changed so rapidly.  This gives the reader the inside view of the business. Captain X has some great stories in this book.  I read this book back in the early nineties, and I have read it again this week.  Much of what he relates is still very valid, and I still found interest in this material.  The last chapter on the future is not valid, so discard this chapter.  A good read.
