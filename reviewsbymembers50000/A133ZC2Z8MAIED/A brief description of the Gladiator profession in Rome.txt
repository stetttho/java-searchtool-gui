 Michael Grant has written some wonderful books about the ancient world.  Although this book is informative and very readable, the depth of this book is not great.  It is mostly a summary of the life of the gladiator, and how these brutal games evolved.  Many pictures in this 128 page book.  If the reader is looking for something more substanial, they best look elsewhere.  For those looking for a brief explanation, this is the book.
