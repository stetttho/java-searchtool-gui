 Fundamentalism whether Christian or Moslem always breaks out the nut cases.  So it was with Christian Fundamentalism in the 1820s and 1830s of the United States.  Christianity is undergoing a revival and various creeds are arguing about what is the one true version.  Up through the ranks come the likes of Pierson and Matthews who dream of the old days where women obey men.  They recreate a small kingdom (only a house with several families) with a head patriach.  Matthews becomes King Matthias and makes the decisions in his kingdom.  He selects another man's wife as his servant and allocates the financial resources for his kingdom.  He is in fact a cult leader.  His actions may have resulted in a old man not getting proper medical treatment and then dying.  The civil authorities take him on and prosecute him, whereby he loses much of his power. I didn't know the history of this affair.  It seems rather mild by today's standards.  The book is an OK read.
