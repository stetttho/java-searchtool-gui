 I think this is a nice read about the lives of two people in the F.B.I..  One is the Director Louis Freeh and the other is Robert Hanssen who sold his country away.  As some of the previous reviewers state, there are some small errors in this book (the Daley machine), but much of it gives a picture of two very different people.  Both were smart, had six children, and were very religious Catholics.  But both were very different.  Robert Hanssen did incredible damage to U.S. security by what he sold the Russians, while Louis Freeh tried to make the F.B.I. a more effective counter terrorism machine.  This book has all the aspects of a good story; sex, money, spies, and a hero.  I have not read the other two books, but this book satisfies my interest in the topic.  I liked what the author did when comparing both Freeh and Hanssen.
