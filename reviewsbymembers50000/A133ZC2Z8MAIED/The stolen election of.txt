 I thought this a great read after the fiasco of the 2000 election.  Our constitution is great, but what if the electoral votes are so close and people decide to cheat in a election year.  This was exactly what happened in 1876 where both Democrats and Republicans cheated to get their man into the White House.  The result was the end of Reconstruction and the disenfrachisement of the black population in the South by our glorious Democratic Party.  It also resulted in a disaster of the Hayes Presidency, rather than a reform minded Samuel Tilden as President. Robinson wrote this book in the sixties, but it is still relevant today.  Unless the American people change the way we elect our presidents, this might well happen again.  This is solid, interesting read.
