 A nice little book about a battle between U.S. and Imperial Japanese Navy ships in Iron Bottom Sound.  During this brief encounter the U.S. Navy sunk a Japanese cruiser and destroyer at a cost of a destroyer.  Subsequent action by airplanes out of Henderson sunk an additional two Japanese destroyers. Cook was a participant in this battle and goes into great detail about what happened.  The U.S. Navy which had been rather lackluster up to this point, showed they were brave and ready to confront equal or superior forces.  The result was the Japanese were bested in this battle, with moderate losses.  They withdrew after completing their mission. Since the book is short at only 150 pages, the reader can easily read this in a few hours and understand a little on the Guadalcanal campaign, especially the naval side.
