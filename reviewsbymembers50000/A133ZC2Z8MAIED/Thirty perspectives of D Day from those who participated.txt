 I like Howarth's writings and this has been the sixth or seventh book I read which he authored.  This is a good read, but can't compare with Ryan's book The Longest Day or any of Ambrose's writings.  That said, this was a very informative book, and it places more focus on the British participation than others.  If you read American writings, they focus extensively on the American view point, and leave out the other participants such as the British, Canadians, or even the Norwegians. One thing I like about this particular book was the focus on how the British took tanks and made them specific to the function of the different beaches.  Some tanks detonated mines, others bridged the seawalls, and still others bridged tank ditches.  The Americans used brute force and no specialized equipment and thus incurred more casualities on Omaha Beach.  I have not seen this in other writings. This is a good read on D-Day.  If read with some of the other books, the reader will get a detailed portrait of what happened on June 6, 1944.  This British author's writings have a flow that makes the book interesting throughout the 250 pages.
