 This book has an interesting theme and is an original subject.  I am notat all sure what Masters writes is true, since this history is very long ago, and the sources are not there.  It seems probable that Machiavelli met and knew DaVinci.  It seems clear that DaVinci tried to use the Arno initially to cut off the water for Pisa, and later to improve the commercial position of Florence and the city's boss Borgia.  The book does show how DaVinci was ahead of his time in trying to damm and control a river. This book drags at time and has lots of related material thrown in.  I did learn a little more about the characters of Borgia, DaVinci, and Machiavelli.  An alright read.
