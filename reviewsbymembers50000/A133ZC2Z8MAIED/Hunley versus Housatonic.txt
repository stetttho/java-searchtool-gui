 I like Hoyt's books but as he has gotten older, some of his books have a slapped together feel to them.  This is one of them.  In this short book, Hoyt tells the story of the developement of the Hunley as a weapon of war for the Confederate States of America.  The development of the submarine and the use of the Hunley in the sinking of the Housatonic covered two thirds of the book.  The remaining third details the rediscovery of the lost submarine.   Here is what I don't like about the book.  It tells the story in very simple terms.  The first two fatal accidents with the Hunley are very briefly described.  The further development of Davids (advanced Confederate subs) was mentioned once.  The sinking is covered in ten pages.  The rediscovery of the sub is covered in over thirty pages.  I want to know the history of the sub and what other developments occurred, but this is missing in this book.  This could have been a better than average read.  It was not. This is an OK story of the Hunley.  There are better books out there, but as a short book it accomplishes its task of informing the reader.
