 As the author so vividly describes, the natives were extinguished here as well as the American West.  Reid takes nine of the native groups and describes their plight under both the Czarist and Soviet regimes.  Her travels through these lands in search of the native religion show that most of these native groups have given up a lot in terms of their old lifestyle.  Now these groups are a splinter of the Russian nation.  This is a good travel book about the natives that inhabited Siberia.  Siberia was only recently colonized by the Russian Czarist state, so the Russian experience is a relatively new one.  In fact Tuva was added to the Russian state only in 1944.  The lifestyle change on these natives was great.  This is a nice read about an unknown part of the world.  Reid tries to be fair to the Russian and native groups.  In her writings, she is not condescending to any of these groups.  She does question the Russian political order which is still dominant over these natives.  I hope Ms. Reid is not a snooty British author.
