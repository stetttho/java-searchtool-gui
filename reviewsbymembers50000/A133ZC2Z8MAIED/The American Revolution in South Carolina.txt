 I thought this a nice read on the American Revolution in South Carolina.  Edgar turns his pride of his home state into a discourse on how the events in South Carolina resulted in victory of the Continentals in the American Revolution.  He also relates the events of the first civil war in South Carolina between the Regulators and the Moderators.  He backs up his claim on the fighting in South Carolina with the statistics on the casualties incurred in the fighting there.  I certainly agree South Carolina can take pride in the battles fought and won and why they were important to the infant United States. This is a short book and I thought Edgar could have provided more meat to back up his claims.  His use of examples as the melting of the wicked witch in the Wizard of Oz, I thought was a bad example in a historical record.  All told a good and quick read.
