 Dragnich's view is that the Serbs were the victims since the Ottomon Turks conquered Serbia.  People with common sense would say that this view is not based on facts.  Dragnich defends the Serbs even though most of the facts don't back him up.  He simply ignores those facts, and digs up what facts and statistics do make the Serbs look good. For instance, Dragnich maintains the Serb government had nothing to do with the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand.  Of course he ignores the facts that the Black Hand terrorist group was supported by the Serb intelligence group of the Army. Dragnich states Princip was just a fanatical Bosnian Serb.  He also blames Franz Ferdinand because he should not have ventured to Bosnia during the time because of the Serb national holiday. This is just one instance where Dragnich ignores the facts and says the victims were the Serbs and not the Archduke and his wife.  For the remainder of the book, Dragnich portrays the Croats, Slovenes, and Muslims as benefiting from Serb rule.  This would be like equating a colony as a good experience for those ruled. Atrocities, well the Croats and Muslims were more guilty than the Serbs.  This is the context of this book. At the very least, one gains an idea of what the Serbs have in their heads.  This explains what happened in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo.  The Serbs say let us take back what we gave them.  It might not be true, but this is how they explain their actions.
