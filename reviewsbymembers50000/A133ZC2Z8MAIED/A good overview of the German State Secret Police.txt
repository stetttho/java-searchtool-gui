 If you are looking for a good summary of what the Gestapo were about, this is the book.  It details the involvement of Goring, Himmiler, and Heydrich in the founding of this deadly device.  It gives the most famous cases involving the the Gestapo such as the assisination of Heydrich and the plot against Hitler.  One thing this book does poorly is portray events in chronological order, making it confusing for the beginner.  Since this is a book for the beginner, it is liable to confuse him/her more.  Also it is poor is distinguishing the difference between the SS and the Gestapo.  The beginner would think they were one and the same, when in fact they were very different.
