 I believe the author to be a well versed authority on the subject he is writing about which is the rise of political Islam.  This book gives a valid critique of many of the regimes of the Middle East, and the West's policy toward this vast region.  Since this book was written before 9/11, it does not include any of the current developments in this region.  Huband slants his writings against the West (and in particular the U.S.) and Israel.  Therefore we get many criticisms of the U.S. in its policy against Iraq and as a occupying force in Saudi.  We also get the comments of duplicity by the Israelis in their policy against the Palestinians.  I think both comments are off the mark, and that is one reason I rated this book only a three star.   This is a short book, but the language used in the writing of this book makes it unnecessaryly difficult.  The reader will learn of how the failures of the present Middle East regimes gave rise to political Islam.  Failures in providing social services also gave rise to the Fundamentals.  I also think the author panders to much to the Middle East audience.  He blames the policies of the West and those of the elite which rule these countries of the Middle East.  A difficult read and one not recommended for the beginning historian.
