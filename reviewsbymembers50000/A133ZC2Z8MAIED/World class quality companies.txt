 A nice little audio on some great companies.  Not only do these companies value their employees, but they work with their suppliers and customers.  These companies take a lead in helping their local communities and try to produce products which are environmental sensitive.  These companies are in every sense of the word world class.   The cassette is somewhat misnamed since this is more than about quality.  The environment along with being a good corporate citizen is also factored into this rating system.  The tapes go into great discussion about the Baldrige Award and how assessments help a good company became great.  Good ethics also factor into this tape.  In this tape series, a half dozen companies are described and how they have become world class in a number of different areas.  This is great material to review, especially for corporate executives.
