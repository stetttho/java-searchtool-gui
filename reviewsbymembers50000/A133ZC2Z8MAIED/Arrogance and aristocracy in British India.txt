 One can hear the arrogance in this person's writings about British India.  Lord Curzon was a Viceroy of the British Raj and ruled over millions of Indian subjects.  In this short book, Curzon writes about his travels on the subcontinent.  In his travels, he meets some of the Indian royalty, visits Afghanistan and other small princely states, and goes on tiger shoots.  His description of turn of the century India was insightful.  However, one also has to tolerate his arrogance and feelings of superiority over his subjects.  In his eyes, most of the Indians and other native subjects are socially lower than all Europeans.  Curzon writes in this way, and destroys his creditablily. If one can overcome the arrogance of Lord Curzon, this is a great travel and history book.  Be aware of this Englishman's feeling of superiority over his native subjects.
