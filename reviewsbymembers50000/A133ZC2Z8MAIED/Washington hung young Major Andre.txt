 First let me tell you I am not a fan of the narrative approach in history because it gives the author some leeway in slanting history.  I think Walsh does a good job with the available material to make this narrative work in the executuon of John Andre.  What I disagreed with in this book was Walsh making Andre appear as a calculating arrogant person, when in reality he was out of his element as a spy.  After reading the book, I came away with a good impression of Major Andre, not the one the author was trying to convey. I learned from this book how a brave man met his end with dignity.  I also learned the severity of Arnold's treason, and why he should have dangled from the rope, rather than Andre. Washington came across as a distant figure trying to save the young Republic.  The three captors of Andre came across as patriotic men trying to perform their job.  It is sad that in war, some brace, decent men have to die doing their duty.  Andre was just such a person.  He may have been an inept spy, but he was a decent soldier.
