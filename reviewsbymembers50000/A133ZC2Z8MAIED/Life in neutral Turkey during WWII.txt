 I liked this book because it showed the situation of a country desiring to stay out of the war.  Istanbul was only 40 miles from German occupied Bulgaria.  British, Americans, Soviets, Germans, and Italians all bumped into one another in this city and the Turkish capital of Ankara.  These various groups spied on one another and the Turk military, and they in turn were watched closely by the Turkish secret police.  The Soviets tried to kill the German Ambassador Von Papen.  Jewish groups tried to get Jews out of Nazi controlled Europe.   There were many small memorable stories in this book.  One was of a American OSS member looking for the Greek Embassy and knocking on the doot of the Japanese Embassy and being politely told where he needed to go.  Another was the future Pope John XXIII being caught with a bust of Mussolini in his personal quarters and explaining to an American Cardinal that sometimes one had to put on appearances even though a person felt differently.  Then there was the stories of human sufferings like the Turks and British not granting visas to Jews who could escape.  Those not granted visas simply were killed by the Germans.   This is a nice read for WWII historians.  This indeed was a different city to battle the forces of evil in.  The author did a good job detailing a little known theater of war in World War Two.
