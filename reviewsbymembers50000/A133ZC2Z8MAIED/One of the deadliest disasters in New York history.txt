 One hears about some very familiar disasters, but I was not familiar with the General Slocum steam boat disaster.  Over 1,000 people (mainly women and children) died in this disaster on the East River.  O'Donnell does a superb job of detailing New York at the turn of the century and the dangers associated with steamship travel.  Then he goes into great detail about the disaster and the aftermath of the sinking of the General Slocum. I believe O'Donnell does a fair job of detailing who failed in this disaster. The owner, USSIS, and the Captain all were to blame for this dangerous situation.  The result was the decimation of a large German immigrant church community. O'Donnell's short chapters, and his coverage from all angles gives the reader a clear picture of the disaster.  One can understand the nature of this tragedy and the effect on New York City.
