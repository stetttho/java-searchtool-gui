 There is a lot of loose, angry talk in this book.  There is also plenty of passing references to national origin.  As a conservative to moderate Republican, I don't agree with the language, views, and attitudes of Savage.  I can understand where he is coming from because of the liberal bias of the media and uneven playing field. Savage has some good points in these arguments, so that is why I rated it a 2 star than lower.   One reason I don't read books from conservative political commentators is for the reason of Savage's book.  The book makes all liberals to be against this nation, which I don't think is the case (with the exception of Michael Moore).  The struggle between conservatives and liberals is the reason this country is great.  The nation is more balanced.  If we all followed the tenents of Savage, then this nation would be a right wing dictatorship and very few immigrants would come to this country. This book is thought provoking if the reader can get beyond the abusive language.
