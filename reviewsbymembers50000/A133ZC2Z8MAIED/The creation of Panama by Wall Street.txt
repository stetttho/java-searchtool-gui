 As the previous reviewer noted about Senator Morgan from Lousiana, I also found a error in this book.  It states some of the elections from Indiana and how Roosevelt and the Democrats suffered losses in this state.  We are talking of the first Roosevelt and he was a Republican, and not a Democrat.  Perhaps the author or one of the proof readers made a mistake, but it gets you thinking that if they do a poor job in the basics, perhaps the author made other errors.  I don't think Diaz is stretching too far when he states the Administration, certain financial interests on Wall Street, and the French banks conspired to help Panamanians get their independence in exchange for making a favorable treaty with the American government.   This is a nice little book and the author makes some reasonable assertions about how Panama got its independence.  Colombia had already lost Ecuador and Venezuela in the mid 1800s.  Panama was not an intregal part of Colombia and the civil strife in Bogota was great.  All it took was a little money (which the banks loaned) and the will of the Panamanian people, and Panama became independent.  Diaz may think this clouds the reputation of Panama's  founders, but I think it was inevitable what would happen to Panama.
