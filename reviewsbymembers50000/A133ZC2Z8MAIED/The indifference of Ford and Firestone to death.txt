 I liked this book. I think it damns Firestone and Ford's policies of good manufacturing standards and design.  I think it leans too heavily toward the lawyers and customers on this book, but it is evident these manufacturers did not have the best interests of the consumer in mind.  It also paints the plaintiff's lawyers as do gooders, when most of these people are getting 40% of their clients settlements.   The Ford SUVs were clearly dangerous cars that should have been redesigned in their early product lifecycles.  What Ford did by specifying a 26 PSI in the tires offset the stability problem and created another more serious problem.  The friction these tires went through at the lower PSI resulted in tread separation.  Throw in poor manufacturing standards and you have a situation that caused 300 deaths.  The author should be commended for writing a readable account of what happened.  Since I worked for a tire manufacturer (Uniroyal-Goodrich), I found the explanation of tread separation rather simplistic.  The author should have consulted a tire engineer rather than tire builders in detailing what effects tack has on a tire.  Also lacking was what Firestone took out to reduce the tire weight.  More detail needed to go into why the tires were unsafe, rather than just saying it was old rubber or not enough material.  Overall, this was a good book about poor manufacturing design and standards.  If these companies really believed that Quality was Job 1, they would not have manufactured and sold these products.
