 Well, Blount gives us the biography of Robert E. Lee and then some.  Blount tries to give us the psychology of Lee and tends to put the focus off Lee when he does this.  I am sure Blount is a real good cynic, but Robert E. Lee and the Civil War need better than this.  When you do a biography of a great man like Lee, why spend excessive time talking of his tiny feet.  For that matter, why talk about a joke called Pusyism and then spend ten or more pages reviewing this.  (Pusyism was a movement in the Church of England, instilling more Roman Catholic traditions into the church, such as unmarried priests and the lead proponent was Father Pusy).  Blount focuses on this an awful lot, when he should expand on Robert E. Lee.   Blount does an alright job reviewing the personal life of Robert E. Lee.  However he does very poorly in analysis of his professional life and focuses a great deal on areas not relevant.  I would have loved to have had Blount's opinion of the relationship between Lee and Davis, but sadly this is missing.  What we get is jokes about feet and Pusyism.  Jeepers, I could have done better with another book about Lee, by somebody more professional like Burke Davis.
