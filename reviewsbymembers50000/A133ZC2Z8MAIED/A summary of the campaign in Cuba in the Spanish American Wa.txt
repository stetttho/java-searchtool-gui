 Dierks does a wonderful job of describing the campaign in Cuba during the Spanish-American War.  Not only is the land and naval campaign described, but how things may have been different had the Spanish put a little more effort in the battles. Most Americans do not realize how easily the United States could have lost this war despite the closeness of Cuba and the overwhelming American naval might. Dierks details how if the Spanish naval forces acted differently, this may have prolonged the problems for the U.S. Navy.  Also detailed is the mess which was the land campaign against Santiago de Cuba.  If the Spanish commander had thrown in all his forces on San Juan Hill, the outcome of the capture of the city would be different.   Altogether a good read of the campaign, even though it starts slowly.  Dierks shows some insight which I have found lacking in other authors of this campaign.
