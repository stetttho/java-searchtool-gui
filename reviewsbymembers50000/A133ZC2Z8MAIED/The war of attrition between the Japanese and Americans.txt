 Another nice book by Hoyt.  Hoyt writes a nice story, even though there are no academic breakthroughs here.  Hoyt describes the naval and land battles of the Guadalcanal campaign.  He includes Japanese sources in this story of the campaign.  Because of the complexity of the campaign, this short book is only a summary read of the battle for Guadalcanal.  If one wants a more in depth book, one will need to read elsewhere. There were a couple of distractions in this book.  First there was the habit of describing something about what was happening in the personal basis for the soldiers fighting this campaign, then in the next paragraph, Hoyt tells of the grand strategic dimensions of the war.  This destroyed the flow of the book.  Second, Hoyt tells of the sinking of the cruiser New Orleans, then he tells how this cruiser limped back to port.  Obviously, this was some sort of error. Overall a good summary read of this campaign.  If only the flow was there and the typos were not, this book would have been better.
