 Porch focuses his story on the last grab at Africa from a European country (except Mussolini's grab at Ethiopia).  The story resolves around a general named Lautrey nibbling away at the borders of a falling apart Morocco.  The Sultan no longer commands the repect of his countrymen and the Eurpoean powers have set up their privileges in the country.  France sets the conditions whereby the Colonial department can add Morocco as a  protectorate.  I like Porch's writing style.  This book focuses on Morocco similar to where The Scramble for Africa focuses on the colonial experience of all Africa.
