 I think the author does a great job breaking down the electoral contest in the election of 1800.  Adams was trying to be re-elected and Jefferson was trying his second attempt to become President.  This election saw a stronger contest between the parties representing these two contestants.  Adams was backed by the Federalists and Jefferson was backed by the Republicans (present day Democrats).  This election had ramifications for the whole country.  Either the country was going to be more democratic or the country could have been led by an upper class.  Ferling does a nice job describing the relationship between Adams and Jefferson.  Adams came across as the more heroic of these two characters.  The worst of course was Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr who were opportunistic partisan politicians.  The electoral system was also described in detail.  This is a nice read about a little known event in American history.  I actually learned something from this book that I didn't know before.  The writing was smooth and flowing, so it didn't take long to read this book.
