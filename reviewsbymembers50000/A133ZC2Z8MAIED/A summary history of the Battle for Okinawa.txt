 I have many of Leckie's books about American history.  His books are average reads generally. In this book, Leckie details the last battle of World War II and why Okinawa was picked as an island to be invaded by the Marines and U.S. Army.  At a little over two hundred pages, it is an easy read and one can understand the ferocious fight that developed between the Americans and Japanese. Five chapters of this book deal with the kamikazes and the effects on the U.S. Navy.  Only four pages deal with the attack on the Yamato, which I believe was a significant event of the battle for the island.  The rest of the book concerns the desperate struggle for the island and the death or capture of the Japanese forces.  As a previous reviewer has noted, some of battles for the island have been shorted or left out in this summary history.  Leckie does include some interesting details, such as the fact 10,000 Japanese soldiers surrendered rather than commit suicide. This is an average read about a great battle.  Leckie provides a lot of upfront history prior to explaining the great battle over the island, and this might lessen the interest of those who want to read about the subject of the book.  Operation Iceberg is a more detailed book about this battle.
