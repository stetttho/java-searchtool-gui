 There have been few books on this subject (at least those available in the U.S.), and this book describes this crisis well. Over 300,000 troops escaped envolopement from the Germans by evacuating from Dunkirk.  Lord does his capable best in writing how the British and French were outflanked and almost destroyed, but the Germans turned a great victory into a minor one.  Goring and his Luftwaffe did inflict terrible damage and caused much death, but the fact is the greater part of the British Expedionary Force was allowed to escape and fight again another day.   One thing I like about Lord's writings are his personalization of the conflicts.  We hear from soldiers who actually fought and escaped through Dunkirk.  His writings also tell the story through a description of what went on and the military strategy involved.  Lord is one of my favored authors.  He devoted much time (2 years) for each book he has written.  It is a shame we no longer have him here to write great books.
