 This is a great book for the novice historian since it explains the battle with maps and explanations of all three sides (British, French, and Prussian).  Not only is the battle explained, but brief biographies of all the major players in this drama are also included.  One can get an idea of why this battle was waged the way it was because of all these descriptions.  Chandler is very fair to all sides in this battle as he describes the conduct of the campaign.  One of the previous reviewers attributes him being British as taking the British perspective, but I don't believe this to be true.  Chandler describes the battle from all perspectives. This is a great introductory book of the battle.  It is a summary, but not an in depth story of the battle.  The pictures, maps, short biographies, make this a very good read of the Waterloo battle.
