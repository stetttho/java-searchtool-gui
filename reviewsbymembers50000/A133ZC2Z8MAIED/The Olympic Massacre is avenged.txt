 As some of the previous readers have stated, this is a great read on counter terrorism.  Those Palestinians who had a role in the Olympic murders are dealt with by a professional hit squad sent out from Israel.  Jonas makes the reader know who he is supporting, Avner and his four buddies assigned to track down eleven people who had a hand in the Munich murders. I don't know if you can believe everything in this book.  Jonas in his introduction and footnotes, states that some things were just not reported in the newspapers.  When Avner and his buddies kill three Arabs in a church in Switzerland, and there are no news accounts, I wonder if this ever took place.  Same with his buddies who were killed and the Athens KGB man, this might be fiction.  Without knowing who Avner really is, this might be part true or even a novel. All in all a great read on how Israel dealt with terrorism in the seventies.  Israel put the fear of God in those who put fear in others.  Just retribution.
