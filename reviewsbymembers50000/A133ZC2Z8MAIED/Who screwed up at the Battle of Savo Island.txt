 The authors take to task WWII naval historian Morrison for identifying the Australian search pilots as the culprits for the Allied unprepardness in the naval battle of Savo Island.  The pilots reported the Japanese task force sailing south toward Guadalcanal.  Rather the communications system along with the decisions of U.S. Admiral Fletcher and British Admiral Crutchley resulted in five crusiers being badly damaged or sunk and over 1200 Allied seamen dieing.  Crutchley is in for the blame of leaving his task force without a good command structure while he went off to attend a conference.  Fletcher deserves his share for removing the naval air arm from protecting the landing fleet.  The Japanese were aggressive, and used these mistakes to inflict a loss of four cruisers and one destroyer on the Allies. This is an interesting read on a controversial battle.  The Allies obviously learned from this to take the Japanese to task later.  The authors did superb investigative work to uncover the real lapses of judgement by those in command, and not brave airmen trying to make a difference.
