 Another great maritime story by Edwin Hoyt.  In this story, the Atlantis (Raider 16) makes a trip around the world on its goal of destroying Allied shipping.  The captain snares Allied ships, and then either places them with prize crews or sinks them.  This true story takes place in 1940-41, with the crew of the Atlantis being the most successful of the German surface raiders. This journey was also the longest and took them to most of the oceans of the world. This is an early book by Hoyt.  Hoyt's books are very readable and interesting.  This took me only a day to read, and is a good adventure read.
