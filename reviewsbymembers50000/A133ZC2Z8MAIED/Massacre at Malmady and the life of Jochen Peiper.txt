 The author has written many books on WWII and has befriended many old Nazis.  One of the books the author has written was on the Massacre at Malmady.  What the author did with his previous book about Malmady is add chapters on Jochen Peiper.  So therefore the reader gets a brief history of Peiper, the discussion on what happened when SS troopers opened fire on American POWs, and then the murder of Peiper in the 1970s by mysterious persons. The author argues that Peiper was far away from the scene of the shootings, did not give written orders how to treat POWs, and then later saved 150 American POWs who were captured and released.  Whiting gives the view that Peiper was innocent of the charges of shooting these American prisoners.  He also details the reaction of American soldiers following the discovery of the massacre.  In this case, SS troops captured were also shot, rather than taken prisoner.  The trials of the SS Waffen troops was also detailed. I am reading my third book by Whiting.  His books provide the accepted view of what really happened during this time period.  His books lack detail that make other history books more substancial in their view.  In this book, you get a tiny history of Peiper, more on the massacre, and then a little look at Peiper's murder.  More detail would have silenced others who have criticized Whiting's books,
