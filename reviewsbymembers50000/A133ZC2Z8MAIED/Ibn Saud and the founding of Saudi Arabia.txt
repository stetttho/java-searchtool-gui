 Another fine book from David Howarth.  I have read eight of Howarth's books and they are all fine reads.  This is no different.  Howarth details the life of Ibn Saud, the founder of modern day Saudi Arabia.  Saud's sons still rule Saudi Arabia today.  Even though this book was written in the sixties, Howarth details the reactionaries that influence the politics of Saudi Arabia today.  Ibn Saud embraced a form of puritanical Islam (Wahhabi) and spread it through those parts of Arabia he conquered.  Bin Laden embraces this form of Islam now, and you can see the problems it has caused.  One chapter I was especially interested in was the terror these reactionary forms of Islam tolerates.  The Wahhabis raided settlements in Iraq and Trans-Jordan in the twenties killing men, women, and children and stealing their property because they were "infidels".  Those they killed were fellow Moslem breathren.  However because they did not embrace the Wahhabi form, they were infidels and ripe to be killed.  I guess Bin Laden is just following in the footsteps of his forefathers. An interesting read about an interesting man.  This book explains a lot about the present day problems with Saud's Arabia.
