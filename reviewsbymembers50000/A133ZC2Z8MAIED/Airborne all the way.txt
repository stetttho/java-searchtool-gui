 The author Karl Zinsmeister describes his thirty days in March and April, 2003 fighting with the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division on the invasion of Iraq.  Zinsmeister was an embedded journalist reporting for several magazines and papers.  He describes his experiences during these thirty days.  The U.S. Army is indeed a unique institution, and the author had unfettered access to the rank and file as well as the command of this division. The author is of the conservative persuasion and makes this known throughout the book.  He lambasts the liberal media, as well as the liberals in Canada and Europe for opposing the war.  Since I think like him, I agree with what he had to say, but in some readers opinions, this might not be the best objectivity in available war books.  Whatever his views, Zinsmeister makes it known that the Army used all resources to keep civilian casualities and collateral damage at a minimum.  This is reassuring, since the media tend to focus on the negative in a conflict like this. This is a very readable book.  At a little over 200 pages, this is a short read on one journalist's perspective of the war.
