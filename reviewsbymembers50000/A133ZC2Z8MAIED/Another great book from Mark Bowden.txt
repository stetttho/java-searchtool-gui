 Bowden is a great writer.  I like his style.  I read Black Hawk Down in two days, and I read this book in the same time.  If someone wants an intensive read, these are both great reads.  Anybody will realize the outcome of this book.  It is the killing of an evil man.  In this book though, you also see the debate between people about the methods used in the killing of this evil man.  There are some that will only use civilized, lawful means.  Others will use means that will destroy the evil using the methods used by the evil men.  I think we face the same problem today with Osama.  How do we destroy evil using the methods of the civilized world.  Bowden relates the stories of Los Pepes, and the use of methods to take apart the infrastructure of Pablo Escobar's empire. This is a great book.  For those wanting a great read for several days, this would be a great read and a great addition to your library.
