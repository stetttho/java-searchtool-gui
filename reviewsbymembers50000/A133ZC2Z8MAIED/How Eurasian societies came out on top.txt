 How did the Eurasian societies come to dominate the peoples of North and South America, Africa, and Australia.  Diamond places a number of nice theories on how Eurasia came to dominate and colonize those of the other continents.  They are all very plausible, and that is why this book offers such a vast vault of information.  In fact, there is a lot of info in these pages, so the reader may be placed on overload just trying to understand all this.   Some of the theories focus on the geography of the Eurasia compared to the others.  Eurasia spreads east and west and in many cases, weather was duplicated from one place to the next.  The other continents were spread north and south.  The peoples of Eurasia built cities and were more concentrated than other societies and thus were more immune to diseases.  When these diseases came into contact with people from other continents, there was no one who was immune.  Big tamed animals and plants were more plentiful in Eurasia than elsewhere.  There is so much more in this book that is all very valid.  That is why Eurasian societies ended up with more of the cargo. This is a great read.  Allow some time to understand all the theories because there is plenty of meat in this book.
