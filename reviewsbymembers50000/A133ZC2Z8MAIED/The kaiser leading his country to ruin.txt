 This is a short biography of Germany's Last Emperor, William II. As stated previously, it is short and a summary of his life. The story includes his own downfall, leading Germany to the Weimar Republic and then Nazi Germany. The book does its best work in describing William's early life, and his frosty relations with his English mother and relatives. This led to alienation from the English royalty and prevented  Germany from forming an alliance with Great Britain, and a more liberalized regime in Germany. The book describes William's views on Jews, French, Russia, and Great Britain.  This was not a positive side to his personality. Also detailed is his relationship to his mother, wife, and various mistresses, with a possible homosexual relationship with  his best friend.  The author does not go into detail into this last aspect, because there is not much evidence.  His choice of people to lead his Empire resulted in the First World War.
