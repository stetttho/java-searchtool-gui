 I have to agree with the previous reviewer.  The two Balkan Wars of the 1912-1913 were bloody affairs, and it is a shock to see a writer of the British aristocracy treat them with contempt.  Joyce seems to more concerned with what he is eating, and his fellow countrymen's particular personalities than with reporting the bloody conflict.  Only in the later part of the book do we get a view of some of the conflict's results.  Perhaps this was strictly a personal journal of the writer's own feelings and was not meant for publication.  If that is so, it shows the disdain this author had for the victims of the Balkan Wars. There is not much info in this book.  If one likes his novels, then this may be a book to read.  For the historian, forget this book.
