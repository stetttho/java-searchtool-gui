 Bernard Lewis is a prominent Middle East historian whose current works focus on the causes and use of terrorism in this area.  This is one of his first books and he details the rise of the assassins in the Shiite area of Syria and Iran.  The Assassins practiced political terror, since they were a small sect which held little ground.  The use of assassination gave them advantages over their larger rivals, since it instilled fear into the top polical level of their rivals.  These rivals wanted to control the Ismaili territories, but could not due to their location and the threat which assassination posed. Lewis's book is overly scholarly and the readability of this short book is difficult.  Many complex Islamic names also hinder the reader's ability to comprehend some of this material.  However, the book gives the story of the rise of the assassins and the history of the religion of the Ismailis and the Aga Khan. This book is beneficial to the history of the Middle East.
