 How do you criticize someone who developed partnering between two large corporations.  Lou developed a good relationship between Proctor and Gamble and Wal Mart.  He made a stormy relationship into one which benefited both these large corporations.  Lou also managed in an economy dominated by  dictator Marcos in the Philippines.  Both of these relationships helped develop Lou into a successful manager.  These stories and Lou's early business life selling soap constitute much of the book. I think this book has some common sense ideas on how to approach customers.  Some of those listed include treating everybody fairly and equally, developing partnerships, treating employees as you would want to be treated and being a change agent.  For the last item, this will involve rocking the boat, and might get people upset with you.  But being a change agent is never easy. This is an easy book to read.  There are no radical solutions here, just a common sense approach to business.  This is why I rated it only as an average read.
