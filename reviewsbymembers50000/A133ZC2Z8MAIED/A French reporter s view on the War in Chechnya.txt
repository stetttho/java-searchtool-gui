 Ms. Nivat reports on the War in Chechnya by way of traveling with the civilians and rebels of this war torn province of Russia.  Civilians are indeed the victims of any war, and there is no difference in this conflict.  I would say that perhaps the Russians were more brutal than other nations.  Their targeting of civilian centers by artillery and air bombing turned many of the Chechen civilians against the Federation of Russia.  Nivat is very sympathetic to the Chechens.  She has been treated kindly by them.  She makes frequent mention of the Wahabbis (Islam Fundamentalists) and even describes the terror of these fighters. Present day knowledge shows that many Chechen Fundamentalists fought and died for the Taliban of Afghanistan.  Chechens themselves have been accused of killing and beheading foreigners helping the civilians of Chechnya.  Knowledge of this makes me think Nivat could have been a victim of a Chechen crime.  Sympathy for the civilians is one thing, supporting Chechen Fundamentalists is another.  Chechens invading other provinces of the Russian state and bombing apartment buildings does not give me much sympathy with the goal of this ethnic group. Nivat has too much sympathy for the civilians and overlooks the killing of the rebels.  This was (is) a fierce war, and both parties don't look too appealing.
