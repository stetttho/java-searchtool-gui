 The previous reviewer does a good job of detailing what the book is about.  Francisco Lopez declares war on Brazil and Argentina because they interfered in the internal politics of Uruguay.  Uruguay (under a Liberal government) sides with Brazil and Argentina.  Paraguay invades both Argentina and Brazil and seizes property and land.  These three states form the Triple Alliance and roll back the Paraguay invasion and then invade Paraguay. It is interesting to make a present day equation with another state called North Korea.  Both are headed by sons of dictators who assume the dictatorship.  Both are isolationist and militaristic.  Both pose a threat to their neighbors.  I am surprised that in the summary, the author did not make the comparison.  But the author strictly details the history and politics of the war.  Hats off to Mr. Leuchars for detailing this bloody conflict which caused the death of 60% of Paraguay's population. After reading the book, the military battles come off a bit dry.  Lopez's terrorism is something else.  He shot his own brother and had his mother and sisters whipped because he thought they were plotting against him.  Presently Paraguay makes him out as a hero, but the reader is left to come to his own conclusion.  Leuchars explains that without him, Paraguay may have ceased being a nation. Again I commend the author for writing about a little known conflict.  I wish he would have included some photographs in this book, although the maps were great.  The only reason I gave it a four rather than a five star, is that the military aspect was rather dry reading.
