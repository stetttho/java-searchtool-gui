 Taylor gives us a unique view of the 19th century German statesman Bismarck.  What is unique about this very readable book is that he doesn't takes Bismarck at his word.  Rather he delves into what Bismarck actually did and the resulting consequences.  It shows Bismarck as an opportunist who made events beneficial to first Prussia and then Germany.  Bismarck is shown to be self centered egotist.  He parlayed his gifts into a united Germany, but ensured a future World War by his treaty with the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  It is interesting to note that Bismarck had no strong loyalty to William I or William II.
