 A nice collection of stories about how service counts in the airline business.  American is the only legacy carrier not to go into bankruptacy and for people who wonder why, it is not leadership but the people providing customers with great care.  Only when you care for your customer do you build a clientele who will buy your product.  Other airlines failed to do this, but American has always done this.  The book is a series of stories related by employees of how they follow that strategy.  At the end, there is a story of the CEO (Casey I think) and how the base put him on the wrong plane.  Casey ended up in Chicago rather than Washington.  The stories are simple, service and care for your customer and they will reward you with repeat business.
