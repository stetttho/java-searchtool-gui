 There are two stories in this book.  The first is about the eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano that resulted in the deaths of 23,000 people.  The second is the death of six scientists and three Columbians in the Galeras eruption.  The scientists killed were led by Stan Williams, who also substained very serious injuries.  The three Columbians were local hikers in the area. If the focus was on numbers, Bruce should have concentrated her studies on the Nevado del Ruiz eruption that killed so many Columbians because of the mud slides.  This was not done, but the focus was on diminishing the egotistical Stan Williams who led six of his companions to death.  Both stories are worth a book of their own.
