 Spencer wrote this book for young adults, but I thought it a good read for those uneducated in China's history.  Sun Yat-sen was certainly a dreamer and an idealist, but he provided his countrymen with an inspiration for a different China, not the semi-feudal Manchu Empire.  In large result, Sun was responsible for the Revolution that overthrew the Manchus.  He also was an inspiration for the latter Chinese Nationalists and Chinese Communists.  Both Chinas now pay reverence to his legacy. This is a quick and easy read for those interested in China.  This book is a good read for both the young adult and the adult.
