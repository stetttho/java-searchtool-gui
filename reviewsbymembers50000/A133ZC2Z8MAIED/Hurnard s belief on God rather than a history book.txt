 This book is a little misleading.  This is supposed to tell of the eyewitness account of the siege of Jerusalem and the birth of Israel.  This is what it says on the cover, but in fact, most of the book talks about Hurnard's belief in God.  It even goes into Biblical prophesy on the second coming when Israel was reborn.  At least half of the book is devoted to Hurnard's belief.  This is what I hate about born again people, they feel they have all the answers and the rest of us are pagans.  Hurnard writes very little about what happened to her during the siege.  She recounts stories about the shells and bombings of her neighborhood, but other than that, not much else. The reader interested in the birth of Israel should avoid this book.  This is a book about faith, and is more at home in the religion section.
