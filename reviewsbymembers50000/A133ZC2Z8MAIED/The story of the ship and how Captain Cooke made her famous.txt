 Endeavour was the small ship that Captain Cooke first ventured to the South Seas with.  Her crew of little under a hundred people was outfitted for a voyage which would take over two years to complete.  Cooke is like Columbus to Australia, and Endeavour was like the Santa Maria.  In this book, Macarthur details the crucial aspects of life aboard this small ship.  Cooke shared his suite with a number of different scientists.  This voyage must have been very difficult and life in cramped quarters must have been a trying experience.  A replica was built of the Endeavour in the nineties and there are some nice pictures in the book of this vessel.  This short book is well illustrated. Unless you are a person interested in Cooke or his travels, this book has little appeal to the average reader.  It is a short summary of the history of a famous ship.
