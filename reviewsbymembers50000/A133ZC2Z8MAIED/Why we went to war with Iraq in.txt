 I admire Keegan and his thoughtful books about why nations/people go to war.  This is a good book detailing why the United States and Great Britain went to war with Saddam's Iraq in 2003.  Obviously the war in Iraq is not over with the spreading guerrilla war against the Coalition Occupation.  The consensus is this was the war to topple the Baath Party and Saddam's dictatorship of Iraq.  This is why Keegan limited the focus of the book to just the regime change in Baghdad.  He also covers the killings of Saddam's sons and the capture of Saddam himself.  For all those who opposed the war, this thoughtful book tells the reasons why it happened. At a little over two hundred pages, this is an easy read, and gives a detailed summary of the stages for the war.  Before the action, Keegan details a short summary of Iraq, along with a chapter about Saddam.  A final summary of what the U.S./U.K. face with the guerrilla challenge should have been added.  This is a good read.
