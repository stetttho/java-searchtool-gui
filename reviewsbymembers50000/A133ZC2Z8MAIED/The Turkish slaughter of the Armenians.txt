 Graber's book about the Armenian genocide is unique.  The West only heres of the Jewish Holocaust and the recent events in Cambodia, Rwanda, Biafra, Bosnia, and Kosovo.  However there was a first genocide and it occurred in the Ottoman Empire against the Armenian population.  Whereas other peoples have admitted their past histories of killing groups of people, the Turks say it didn't happen or as an alternative that the Armenians deserved what they got.  You can see this attitude displayed in the previous reviews.  The Armenian genocide occurred and it displays the indifferent attitude of the Sultan of 1895-96, the Young Turks, and the Ataturk government. One reason why I didn't rate this book the full five stars is the brevity of the book.  The book trys to be all by talking of genocide in general, and this particular genocide in detail.  It doesn't do justice to both.  Graber should have devoted his energies to the latter.  Graber does a good job detailing how the Young Turk leadership (Talaat) led the genocide efforts and direction.  Talaat's fate is deserved--he was assassinated in Berlin and the murderer was set free. This is a good introduction to one of the first genocides.
