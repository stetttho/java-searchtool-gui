 Gordon's book is a little wooden, but it packs a lot of history in this short 170 pages.  Some of the other Penguin life books have been a little wacky in their interpretation of the life of these great people, but Gordon does very well in her version of Joan of Arc.   Joan of Arc was a great leader of people in the unification of France.  However her life was very short, and her military insight was slight causing her to be ultimately defeated.  King Charles may have been a slacker but at least he saw his goal of a united France, long after Joan went up in flames.  I think Gordon does a good job in detailing this. At the end, Gordon shows us the after effects of Joan being burned.  The Catholic Church bowing to political pressure started the process of making Joan a Saint in the late 1800s.  Gordon relates these events in a concise summary.  A good short read for those interested in the history of France.
