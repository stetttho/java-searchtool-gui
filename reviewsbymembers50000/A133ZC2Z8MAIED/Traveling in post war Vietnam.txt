 This was not a completely balanced account of post war Vietnam.  It is obvious the author was seduced by the Communist authorities when he visited Vietnam in 1989.  I say that because when he talks of the effects of war on the south, he mentions the white terror of Diem without mentioning the red terror of the Viet Cong.  The red terror targeted not military targets but teachers and bureaucrats.  Sheehan does not mention that but Diem's terror campaign, which was mild compared to the red terror.  Also when he talks of the 1963 coup against Diem, he terms it the American led coup.  Again another fallacy since the coup leaderes had Washington's blessings, but was not led by Americans.  Another small lie was the Cambodia invasion by Vietanm.  Sheehan wants us to believe that Hanoi was not interested in dominating Cambodia.  Most analysts would view this an incorrect statement.  If you can read through Sheehan's opinions, it gives those interested in the war some perspective of what happened after the war.  Caution is in order for Sheehan's opinions.
