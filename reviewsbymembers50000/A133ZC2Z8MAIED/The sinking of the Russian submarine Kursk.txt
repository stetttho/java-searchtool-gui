 This is a good overview of the sinking the Russian submarine Kursk and the general state of the Russian Navy.  With the breakup of the Soviet Union, the defense establishment has received far less attention and resources than before.  This contributed to the sinking of the sub. I was particularly interested in what motivated the claims of the Russian Navy that another submarine collided with the Kursk resulting in her loss.  The facts are otherwise, but the political motivation to blame an external power was there.  Incompetence by either personnel on the Peter the Great in shooting off a missle or in the torpedo technicians on the Kursk (not Navy personnel) led to this disaster.  Old habits die hard in Russia, so someone else to blame was necessary.  Burleson does a good job of writing about this in the book.
