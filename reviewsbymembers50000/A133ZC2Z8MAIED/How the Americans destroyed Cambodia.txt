 In my title sentence, I basically give a summary of Shawcross's contention that Cambodia was destroyed by the United States.  I think Shawcross makes good points on why the United States must bear some responsibility in the destruction of this small country.  What is lacking is an even review of all the characters in the history (Khymer Rouge, Viet Cong, NVA, ARVN, and the Thais) of Cambodia.  The Vietnamese Communists have as much a stake in why Cambodia turned out as it did.  I think Shawcross purposely overlooks this and points the finger at what he percieves as the evil doers of American policy--Kissinger and Nixon. I think Shawcross does a good job of relating how the USA tried to salvage the intervention in Vietnam at the cost of destroying a small country.  I think he proves that point.  I also enjoyed his portrayal of all the principal American and Cambodian players in this drama.  As I said, a more critical look at the Vietnamese would give this book a more even outlook.  After I read this book, I understoon why Presidential Administrations did not involve Kissinger in future policy.  Henry comes off as arrogant in the least, evil at the most.  For more information on what happened after this time in Cambodia, please read Brother Enemy.
