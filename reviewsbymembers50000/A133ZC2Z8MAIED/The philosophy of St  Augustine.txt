 St. Augustine's life was that of a writer on the relationship between God and his people.  Much of the material he has written forms the backbone of the Christian religions.  He is an important person in Western civilization.  This book by Garry Wills is supposed to tell Augustine's biography.  Instead Wills spends countless pages on philosophical arguments and one does not get a good view of this man nor the times he lived in. A previous reviewer commented that one should read the writings of St. Augustine himself, rather than try to fathom what he stood for in the Wills book.  I agree with this assessment. I don't really care for Wills' politics and after this book not alot for his writing.  This was a difficult book for me to get through.  Even though it is short, the writing style has a lot to be desired.  Perhaps Wills intended this book for his students at Northwestern.  A real disappointing read!
