 As the recent conflicts in both Afghanistan and Iraq show, the West has had to confront Islamic fundamentalism throughout its history.  In the 1880s, the Mahdi rose to prominence as the hidden Iman and confronted both British and Egyptian Imperialism in the Sudan.  The British Prime Minister withdrew from the region rather than confront the threat.  For close to 15 years, most of the Sudan was ruled by the Mahdi and his successor Khalifa.  During those years, many atrocities were committed in the Sudan including slavery and cruel punishment for those who didn't believe.  When Britain decided to re-engage in the Sudan, it was only because the French were exploring the area.  This is the jist of Warner's book.   As one of the previous reviewers has already noted, this book is a Western perspective and so perhaps is the slant on the cause of the Mahdi.  The military campaigns were well detailed, but there is too little perspective from the other side.  This is the only criticism of this book.
