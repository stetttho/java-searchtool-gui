 This is an OK book for those who do not know much about ancient Egypt.  In fact not much is known about Nefertiti other than what people have uncovered when exploring the ruins of this great empire.  Samson does a good job on explaining the theories of Nefertiti and her husband and daughters.  Samson spends less time on Cleopatra, although more is known of her.  For a more detailed explaination of these figures, try something Michael Grant has written.  For those seeking an introduction to these great figures, this is a nice book.
