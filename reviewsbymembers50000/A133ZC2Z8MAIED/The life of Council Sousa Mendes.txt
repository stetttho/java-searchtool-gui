 As the previous reviewer from Portugal noted, humanity sometimes fails to acknowledge people who do the right thing.  Sousa Mendes was just such a man.  He was a Portuguese Council in southern France at the time of the German invasion.  Jews from the low countries and France fled south trying to get to the neutral countries of Spain and Portugal.  These countries sealed their borders in most cases, so one had to have a visa to get across the border.  Sousa Mendes violated his country's rule aginst these stateless persons, and literally issued thousands of visas so that these Jews and other opponents of the Nazis could escape.  In the process, he destroyed his career and eventually died in poverty.  He did do the proper thing where most others abided their country's rules. This was an inspirational read.  Fralon details the life of Sousa Mendes and Portugal's role in both World Wars.  He also details a little of the fascist rule of Salzaar.  Unfortunately there were no happy endings with Sousa Mendes.  The Portuguese government even balked at honoring him, and was forced by outside pressure to recognize what he did in the nineties.
