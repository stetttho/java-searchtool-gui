 This is a nice view of what happened when Kennedy, Kahn, and Carter deregulated the airline business in the late 1970s and the resulting chaos caused by this new law.  A stable industry was thrown for a loop as new laws were implemented, and the old ways were thrown out.  Such venerable companies as Pan Am, Braniff, and TWA went out of business.  Predators in the business (Ichan and Lorenzo) bought up companies and vowed labor confrontation to bring down costs.  Some companies(United, American, and Delta) became giants in the industry.  This book describes the immediate aftermath of the airline deregulation act.  More people flew and were employed in the business, but many lost their careers and incomes in this consolidating industry. I think the authors did a wonderful job of depicting the industry up to 1991.  I would have liked some more information on the early part of the industry, since this may have shed more light on their various philosophies.  Overall a great book on the industry.
