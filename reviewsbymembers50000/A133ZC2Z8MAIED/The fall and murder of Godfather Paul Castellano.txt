 This is a great read, and the only reason why I gave it a four star is because the authors seem to sympathize with Casellano.  Castellano was the head of one crime family of five in New York.  They specialized in corruption and punishment of those who didn't let them get their way.  When Paul talks of clipping people, he means he will have someone murder them.  Should we have sympathy for someone who has clipped others, being clipped himself.  Or for that matter, the man who busted up people with a baseball bat getting six slugs in him.  I think not.  These guys got what they deserved.  The only bad thing is the Gambino crime family fell into the hands of John Gotti and his son.  They were bigger hoods than Castellano. This book is an interesting read in the fact of how it sheds light on the La Costa Nostra.  These people are human.  This is all too apparent with Paul Castellano.  He was an old man who fell for a younger woman.  He lost his management abilities and with an organization like the Mafia, there was no retirement villa but some bullets to the head.  It sheds light on the lesser figures who led some of the other families.  These guys are not invicible, but are human and make mistakes.  Their fall is proof of their mistakes.
