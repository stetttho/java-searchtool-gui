 This is a book about two pilots of a crashed Eastern Airlines flight 401 bound from New York to Miami.  The plane crashed in the Everglades because the pilots concentrated on correcting a burned out light bulb (for the landing gear) and disconnected the autopilot, allowing the aircraft to crash land in a swamp. The plane was the relatively new L-1011.  These two pilots survived the crash, only to die of their injuries.  EAL used some of the parts of the crashed plane in other airliners.  These other L-1011s were subsequently visited by the dead pilots. The pilots did not haunt the aircraft, but they wanted their presence known.  On several occassions, they helped warn of problems and fixed aspects of the aircraft.  Both pilots were friendly, but their presence caused emotional disturbances with the flight and cabin crew. Fuller has written a number of books about the supernatural.  I don't know if I believe him on all aspects of his writings.  This book had a solid story of the crash, followed by sightings of the ghosts, and then some weird stuff of mediums and communicating with Don Repo through a Ouija board. The last four chapters are hard to believe.  Fuller died in 1990, so only he can tell us if all this stuff is really true.  John, I await your answer whether all this stuff is true.
