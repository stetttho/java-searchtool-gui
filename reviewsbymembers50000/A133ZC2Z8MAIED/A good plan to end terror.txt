 I have to agree with the authors.  There is far too much anti Americanism in the world today.  Everywhere you go, people are blaming the bad United States for all the evils in this world.  Some of these evils were born in Third World countries dominated by a dictator, and the population just blames the bad ole U.S.A.  Muslim fundamentalism was born in a Wahhabi Saudi Arabia and spun out to the rest of the Arab world.  This fundamentalist religious movement turned into a political movement fascinated with terrorism.  What is America to do with all these threats.  The authors give an idea of what to do in this book.  I don't agree with everything that is said in this book.  At least the authors have a plan on how our country should lead the world to face the conflict of terror.  It will not be easy and it could cost some blood and treasure, but at the same time the USA will face down some of those threats to its existence.  This involves confronting Saudi Arabia, France, Iran, North Korea, and China.  No wonder the authors got so many negative reviews.  As the authors state, this doesn't mean war with these countries.  It does mean that the United States must take a tougher line against those who condone or even encourage the use of terror.  This is a nice thought provoking book.  There is a lot of suggestions which the United States ought to think about or even implement.
