 This book is alot like light beer.  It satisfies somewhat, but after consuming it, you wonder why.  I like Chris Matthews, because I think he tries to be fair to both sides on his TV show.  I read to learn new things, and regretfully I learned little from this book.  This book tries to tie in history, famous figures, and movies.  Well, I suppose there is something to this, but history is history and not stories in movies.  The other tenet in this book is the characteristics of Americans that make them different from the rest of the world.  Again a long stretch.  People are people, and Americans are no more unique than others in this world. I think highly of Chris Matthews and his first book Kennedy and Nixon.  This just wasn't a great book.  There are more deserving books out there.
