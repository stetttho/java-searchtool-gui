 This book begins well enough in the description of Augusto Pinochet.  The first two chapters describe his early family life along with his reluctant decision to join the junta plotting the overthrow of the Allende government.  The last two chapters then go into unproven killing, torture, and drug and weapons trafficing.  The author tries to give us a picture of a dictator that knew everything going on in Chile.  I am not sure that is the case.  I do know this dictatorship in the process of overthrowing the legal Marxist government killed 3,000-4,000 people.  That is a fact.  I am sure torture and killings were part of the plan to stay in power.  I am unsure whether they were systemic, as they are in Castro's Cuba. I don't believe this is a balanced view on Pinochet's Chile.  I believe there is much truth in this book, but also stories that don't pass the muster of honest reporting.
