 This is a nice book detailing the history of the Bush/Walker clan and the early life of George W. Bush.  There is a lot of trash out there about this man and his politics, so it is hard to get a good biography of him.  Make no mistakes, Minutaglio reveals a lot of the unsavory side of George W., but it is unbiased and he deals in facts.  He also covers the strengths of this man, so the reader can get the good and the bad about him.  The author only reveals the facts of his National Guard stint and the glosses over the drug allegations, so the reader cannot judge the current controversy over these allegations.  I enjoy a book dealing in facts and not conservative/liberal conjecture.  Minutaglio does a good job in this. I especially like how Minutaglio reveals the personal relationship of George W. with his father.  This is probably the most difficult aspect of this book, but the author summarizes their relationship well.  Few other authors have attempted this with George W.   For those wanting a good biography of our 43rd President, this is nice book and read.  For those wanting to read trash, go elsewhere--there is plenty to pick from.
