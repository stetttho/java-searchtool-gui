 This is my second book I have read by this author.  It was an OK read and dealt with the little known spy and saboteur war in the United States and Great Britain in World War II.  I did not know much about this war and how the Germans waged it.  This book informed me of the war.  There was some interesting facts in this book.  One was how the Germans conspired with the IRA and Ukrainian nationalists in the sabotage war in both countries.  The IRA certainly helped the Germans in their use of explosives on both civilian and military sites.  The other facts about the U Boat landings in the United States shed light on the use of saboteurs on the war industries. Some other recent books have dealt with some of these episodes.    One criticism I have of this author is that he tends to repeat himself in his writings.  I believe he does this to make sure the reader gets his point.  I'm not sure all the material he footnotes can be trusted and so his method of repeating himself is his way to make sure the reader believes what he thinks. I think he should let the facts stand by themselves.    This is an informative short read.  There are probably better reads out there on this subject.
