 A religious fundamentalist seizes control of a major holy place and unleashes terror onto others for their beliefs.  It sounds like 2001, but in fact it was Amritsar, India 1984 and the religious fundamentalist was a person of the Sikh faith called Bhindranwale.  Bhindranwale was a Sikh fundamentalist who believed in establishing the Punjab as a Sikh state.  Hindus, and other Sikhs who didn't believe as he did were murdered and assassinated.  This was all in the name of religion.  Mrs. Gandhi at first didn't tackle this problem and let Bhindranwale seize control of the Sikh holy place called the Golden Temple. When terror continued to be directed from the Golden Temple, Gandhi ordered the Indian Army to seize this place.  Hundreds of Sikhs were killed because of the Sant getting out of control.  Gandhi was later assassinated by a Sikh as a result of her ordering the Golden Temple raid.  This book is the story of this conflict. This is an average read on a very interesting event.  Few books have been written about this conflict.  I think the authors treated all parties from a equal perspective, so this story is not slanted.
