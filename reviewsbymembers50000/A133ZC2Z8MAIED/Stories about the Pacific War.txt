 A fairly interesting book.  O'Donnell lists the campaigns of the elite troops of this theater of command, details the plan of battle, and then gives the oral histories of those who served in those campaigns.  Most of the veterans are at the end of their lives, so these oral histories present a heartfelt tribute to the difficulties these soldiers endured during combat.  What surprised me most was how these soldiers/veterans got choked up recounting the battles they went through, and the friends they lost.  Freedom isn't cheap, and these soldiers are living proof of how America was affected by the battle. This is a good read.  Oral histories are good at describing the personal experiences of soldiers, but they don't put perspective on the actual battle campaigns.  If one wants to know more about the War in the Pacific, one needs to read a general history, before reading this book.
