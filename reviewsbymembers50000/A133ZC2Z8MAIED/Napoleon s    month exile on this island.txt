 This book shows a unique side of Napoleon that other biographers rarely mention.  Here is the man who ruled France for 12 years, prepared to live the life of an exile until the Congress Allies defy the treaty they made with him.  First, the Austrians take away his wife and child.  Then the Bourbons (they learned nothing and forgot nothing) don't bother to pay the pension promised.  It also shows the the qualities of Metternich and Tallyrand, and there treacherous qualities in statemanship.  These were the men who made Europe after the Congress.  The story revolves around how Napoleon first adapted to life on the island, and then as the Allies thought about rethinking their position toward him and Murat, changed it to make a comeback in France.  The final four chapters deal with his march on Paris and his reinstallation on the throne.  A great story. This is a good book in that it talks about a little known chapter of his life.  The book starts off rather slow, but the chapters are stirring toward the middle and end.
