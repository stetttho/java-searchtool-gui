 Life has always excelled at getting great pictures of our society and this is the case with this book.  There is some minimal writing to complement this book, but it is mainly a picture book, and a brief one at that.  The pictures are great but there is not a lot of meat to this book.   For those interested in visiting the past through pictures, this is a great book.  For those interested in trying to understand this period in the life of America, one will need to try elsewhere for a better book.
