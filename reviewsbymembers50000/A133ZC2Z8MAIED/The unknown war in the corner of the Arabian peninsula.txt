 Mr.Schmidt sheds some light on an unknown war pitting the newly enthroned Iman al Badr against General Sallal.  The Iman had the best intentions of reforming Yemeni society and even admired President Nasser of Egypt.  General Sallal, the opportunist seized power with the help of massive Egyptian manpower and resources.  The royalists fought back, with the help of the Saudi King.  The civil war ends after this book was published, so the reader does not know the outcome of this civil war. The book details a little known war on the Arabian peninsula.  Few people have heard of this war.  What is known is that Nasser waged aggressive war against a poorer nation simply to put his stooges into a position of control.  Kind of makes Nasser's actions in the Suez Crisis look like the hypocrite he was.  For those of you needing a dose of Arab politics, this book show the double dealing nature of the Middle East.
