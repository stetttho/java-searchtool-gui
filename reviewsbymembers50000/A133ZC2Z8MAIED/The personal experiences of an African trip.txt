 I love to travel and I admire Hudson for taking off and spending a year traveling the African continent.  This book relates his experiences in three countries:  Mali, Zaire (DR of Congo), and Somalia.  This was written in the eighties before two of these countries fell to pieces.  It probably would not be safe to travel now with the way things are going in much of Africa.   Hudson's point is the African people are wonderfully kind to strangers, even those from the West.  His experiences prove that once you are off the beaten track for tourists, the people are friendly and helpful to the stranger from another land.  Hudson experiences no discrimination.  He lives and travels like Africans, and gets their viewpoint.  He even understands the corruption common in everyday African life.  I admire Hudson's courage in undertaking this trip and his writing is easy to follow.  A good read.
