 Halberstam does a great job of personalizing the September 11, 2001 tragedy by the portrayal of 13 brave New York firefighters of Engine 40, Ladder 35.  Twelve of these men died on that day, along with many employees of the World Trade Center and countless other firemen.  Halberstam gives a short biography of these thirteen along with a history of this particular firehouse. This is a touching tribute to these firemen.  All of them were male and most were white.  Halberstam paints the positive side of all these men and makes them heroes. The one small criticism I have of this book is that it makes these men larger than life.  They are certainly heroes for going into a dangerous area with less than good prospects of returning. These were men performing a dangerous job, but they were still human and had all the frailities of humans.  What of the other hundreds of firemen who did not return that day?  The tragedy of those other hundreds are lost in this story.  This is a good book to read, but the reader has to bear in mind the other losses on that tragic day.
