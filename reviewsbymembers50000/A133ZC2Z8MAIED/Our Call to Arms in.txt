 What do you expect from a Life book.  Great pictures and that is what this book delivers.  Unlike other books dealing with Pearl Harbor, this Life book examines the conditions in both the U.S. and Japan, then goes in detail about the attack, and then shows some of the personal glimpses of some of the participants sixty years later.  This book excels in both its photos and personal portrayals of people. There are some flaws in this book.  An experienced person can pick them out quite easily.  For instance, it talks about the battleship Shaw blowing up, well the Shaw was a destroyer.  It also details the invasion of Belgium and Netherlands, and states the invasion of France was later, both invasions occurred at the same time.  There were other mistakes, so hopefully this does not confuse the beginning historian. This book was a OK read, and the pictures are great.
