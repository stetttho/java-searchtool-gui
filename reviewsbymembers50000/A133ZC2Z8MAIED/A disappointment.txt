 I have seen Bob Greene on some of the news stories on TV.  I like his wit and sentiment.  I was prepared for a great book on the great generation that produced his and my father.  I was disappointed. First, the book is disjointed.  It goes from sentiment to sentiment, and then reverts back again.  In his talks with General Paul Tidbitts, I thought he kept dwelling on the same emotions of a hard military decision.  That decision was made long ago, and why keep hammering away at it.  Bob, just get over it.  The U.S. had to bomb Japan to spare the lives of American soldiers and sailors.   Another problem I have with this book is its lack of history. It tells a little of the history of his father, some of Tidbitts, and then a little on the Doolittle Raiders.  Other than that, it is pure sentiment, repeated again and again.  For a 300 page book, this could have been cut to 80 pages.  I read this book, and it was a disappointment.  If one wants to remember the Greatest Generation, read something from Ambrose.
