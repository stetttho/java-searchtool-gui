 An excellent book on the Vietnamese War of 1968.  Spector not only tells us why we (Americans) failed at the war but also what the weaknesses were on the other side (Viet Cong and NVA).  The book summarizes some of the problems associated with the war such as race relations, lack of a professional soldiers and officers, and weapons.  Spector describes that 1968 was the critical year of the war.  America and the Saigon regime won the military battles but lost the political war.  He equates the war at that point to the stalemate of the Western Front during the First World War.
