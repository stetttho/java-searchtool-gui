 Armstrong does a good job of clearing up some misconceptions about Islam, especially the split between Shiite and Sunni.  The history is pretty clear.  The chronology, important terms, and important dates were welcome additions.  There is a lot of meat in this small book. The one point which I feel is well taken is the talk of fundamentalism.  Armstrong states that fundamentalists exist in all major religions, including Islam.  Fundamentalists seek to roll the clock back to the good old days, whatever that means.  In the process, they add more to the religion than the original founders had meant.  This addition may be good and bad, but this is what fundamentalists do.  Most of what is added may be good, but the outside world never hears about that.  What we hear about is how fundamentalists like Bin Laden murder thousands of people in the name of a peaceful religion. One point I disagree about is the nature of autocracy in an agrarian state.  Armstrong seems to think democracy can only exist in a industrial society.  I feel there are models where democracy can exist in an agrarian economy. Altogether a good read about a religion which is much in the news these days.  Armstrong covers her subject well.
