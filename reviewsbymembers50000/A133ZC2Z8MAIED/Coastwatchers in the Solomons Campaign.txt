 I like Walter Lord's writing--A Night to Remember and Day of Infamy.  These were two great books about disasters.  Unlike those books, this book is about the experience of the twenty coastwatchers in the Solomons campaign.  It is well written but does not have the intensity of those other two books.  The book is well written and tells about the alert activities of the coastwatchers, along with their guerrilla and rescue actitivities.  The Allied victory at Guadalcanal had much to do with the coachwatchers. This part of World War II might never have been written about were it not for the rescue of the future President of the United States, John F. Kennedy.  Kennedy's part in the rescue shows his leadership abilities. It also dispels the notion of negligence on Kennedy's part in the destruction of the PT-109.
