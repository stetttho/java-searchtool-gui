 This is my fourth book I read on this war, and I actually learned a great deal more of the political battles in this book than in the previous books.  There are a number of books which describe what happens militarily, but little which cover the politics of the war.  This book fits the bill and describes how the American, Russian, Israeli, and Arabs had individual battles and combined this almost resulted in the use of nuclear weapons.  Israeli generals and politicians were very divided and this almost resulted in the end of the Third Temple.  Breshnev used language in letters to Nixon which resulted in US forces going on Def Com 3 alert.  Arab leaders started the war with modest goals and came close to conquering Israel.  The author does a good job of detailing all these little crisises. This is a good solid read about the Yom Kippur War and the airlift which saved Israel.  This is a good addition to your history library.
