 This is a nice expose of the crime of Fort Pillow in the Civil War.  I have to agree with the previous reviewer, this book gets the goods on Forrest.  Southerners revere Forrest, and he was one tough fighter and guerilla leader.  He was also a cheater, racist, and murderer.   First, the author does a great job detailing the essentials of what happened in April, 1864.  Forrest surrounded a Northern fort, and overran some of the outer defences.  A truce was called and an ultimatum was called by Forrest for the surrender of the fort.  During this truce, Forrest cheated and moved soldiers into advantageous positions.  When the commander of the fort refused surrender terms, Forrest overran the fort and most of his soldiers refused the surrender of Northern soldiers and killed them.  One white officer was even nailed to a cabin.  Black soldiers were placed in cabins and the cabins were set on fire.  Soldiers were driven into the river and executed.  The Northern commander was captured and later executed.  Forrest's troops wanted to kill those because of their skin color and/or regional sympathy. After the war, many excuses were put forward by the criminals who did this.  Essentially it was something like this.  The Northern command should not have placed troops in this area.  They were responsible.  As the previous reviewer has already stated, this defense is much like that of a rapist.  Well, that type of defense is not coherent.  What happened was a crime, and something should have been done about it...such as hanging Forrest after the war because he was a criminal.  He should not be made out to be anything but a war criminal.  Yet his statue stands in Memphis today.   I commend the author for writing a great expose of a little known crime of the Civil War.  More needs to known about Fort Pillow, even if it inflames Southern pride.
