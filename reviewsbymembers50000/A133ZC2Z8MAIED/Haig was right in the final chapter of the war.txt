 Terraine's view is that Haig by aggressively pursuing the war in the spring and summer of 1918 led to victory over the Germans.  Generally he thinks the Americans helped but were not decisive in the victory over the Germany Empire.  The French helped but their Army was tired of the war. This is obviously a different picture than what is normally thought of the war.  It is factual but places the perspective onto the British as the ultimate victors of World War One. Also, it disregards Haig's earlier blunders in 1916 and 1917 when he wasted thousands of lives on a few miles of scorched earth. Haig might have been right at the end, but not during the earlier years of the war.
