 Pipes does a bang up job of placing Communism as a brutal system.  As a conservative myself, I find his analysis not always fair.  Pipes makes the comparison that Lenin was worse than Stalin, and his primary motives were revenge when he first revolted against the Tsarist system.  I think some historians would find some fault with this analysis.  I believe Lenin was less brutal than Stalin.  Also his comments about the overthrow of Allende suggest that the Armed Forces coup de etat was legitimate.  WOW, that is certainly a stretch.  His analysis on Castro and Mao were on target. This is a very readable summary of communism.  I would just warn the reader that some of views of Professor Pipes are very conservative, and may not be credible to those who are interested in a even handed approach to history.
