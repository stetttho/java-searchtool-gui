 I like Farcau as an author because he brings to light the little known conflicts of South America.  Obviously he has a special link to this area as his wife and father in law are Bolivian.  Of his two works, The War of the Pacific is by far the better.  In the Chaco War, he details the military and political battles that led to Bolivia and Paraguay going to war over worthless semi arid land.  This war resulted in 100,000 deaths and pointed to the incapacity of the League of Nations in controlling conflict. Farcau does a good job in showing why the Bolivians lost even though they had more money and people.  The Bolivians fought between themselves.  The military fought the politicians.  The generals fought other generals.  Paraguay had a unified system where the politicians supported the generals.  The result was a win by Paraguay of huge tracks of worthless land. As a previous reader has already noted, this book is riddled with typos.  Also the one map did not help the reader in understanding how the military forces were moved.  There should have been ten maps in this book, detailing the moves of the various campaigns.  I felt lost reading of the movements without having a map to consult.  Otherwise a fairly decent read.
