 Lots of books have been written about Lincoln.  Most tackled this subject through Presidential Papers.  Few took the time to look at those who knew Lincoln.  Holzer does this by reading all the available material about Lincoln and getting together the writings of those people who knew Lincoln.  This book is a summary of some of those people remembering Lincoln.  It is great reading.   One is struck by the Lincoln in this book.  He comes across as a very human person.  He was ugly and not very cultured.  He was smart, friendly, and did not take on an attitude with his high position.  He was approachable and easy to talk with.  A baby sitter reveals his humanity with her encounters.  He was not a racist, in a age when most white people were.  He was ready to forgive a people who broke the nation apart.  He was a rare human being.  This comes across in the writting. For those interested in the real Abe Lincoln, this is a great book.
