 What a story!  The ads on the back state this to be the predecessor of the Perfect Storm.  I don't think that is the case but the story is great.  The Leicester leaves London, and rides out two hurricanes.  At the end of the second hurricane-the ballast shifts and the ship takes on a terrible list.  The crew rides out the hurricane on her, and then hails two other freighters and abandons ship.  The ship then travels on a southerly direction until spotted by a salvage tug.  This and another salvage tug take Leicester to Bermuda where she endures another hurricane and is beached with the salvage tug.  The last chapter details the salvage of both the ship and tug.  This was indeed the ship that wouldn't sink. This is a nice little story that will keep the reader's interest. A Perfect Storm is so much more dramatic that I wouldn't rate this book as highly as that.  It is an interesting read.
