 A good book about the end of the Asante Empire.  Edgerton tells the end of this empire from both the British and Asante perspectives.  The Asantes were a militaristic society who preyed on the weaker societies around them, notably the Fante.  The British desired trade and gold, and the conflict was inevitable when the Asante sent armies to conquer the Fante.  This brought the British into conflict. The author takes too much of a nativist perspective in his depiction of the Asante Empire.  This empire gloried in slaves and human sacrifices.  It had a great military tradition, but why would a author try to paint a positive view of a society that sought entertainment value in the putting to death of slaves.  The British may have been interested in conquest and colonization of this land for trade and gold reasons.  They may have been rascist, but the Asante were a brutal society.  The expiration of this empire was perhaps not such a tragedy after all.  The British brought Ghana and the Asante into the modern world.
