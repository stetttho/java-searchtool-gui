 I often wonder why we honor Martin Luther King with a holiday.  For those who wonder why, read this book.  In this book, King uses non violent techniques to force a change in the structure of race relations in this brutal city.  The sixties could have been such a violent time in America had it not been for Dr. King. With his techniques, he changed the social landscape in the deep South for the better.  Why we can't wait is his reason why blacks should not tolerate a gradual change in race relations, but one that recognizes that change is needed as soon as possible.
