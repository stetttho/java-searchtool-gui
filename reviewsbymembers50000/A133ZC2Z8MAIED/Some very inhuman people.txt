 As if we needed a book about 'evil' people, here is a book that many people have read and is in the discount section of a major book chain.  The choice of these 16 men and women is very subjective.  I would have made other choices, as some of these people either don't deserve to be there ('Bloody' Mary and Rasputin) or are small potatoes (Countess Bathory, Ilse Koch). As one of the previous reviewers have noted, why not add a few such as Mao, Bokassa, the Hutu murderers in Rwanda, Himmiler to name just a few.  These people probably deserve to be identified for what they were. This author has subsequently written many other books about evil people (women, dictators, criminals).  I guess the examples of bad people really sell.  I think the subject of this book are all offensive people and we really don't need a book extolling their 'virtues'. One other comment is the poor writing in this book. As a previous reviewer has noted, there are many grammatical mistakes in this book.  I also noted a historical mistake.  The book stated the father of Nicholas II was Nicholas I.  The real father was Alexander III.  Altogether an alright read.  The reader could pick a better book about a more suitable subject.
