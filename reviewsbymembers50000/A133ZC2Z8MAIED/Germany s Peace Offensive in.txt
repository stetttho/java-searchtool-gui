 The first part of this book is quite good and explains the German's plan for ending World War I.  They wanted to force a quick victory by breaking the Western Front before too many American troops entered the fray.  They came close in several sectors.  One of these sectors was the Marne, where a breakthrough created a bulge endangering Paris.  American, British, French, and Italian troops prevented the breakthrough.  Then the Allies went over on the offensive, and put pressure on this salient, and broke the Germans will to fight.    Where this book becomes bogged down are the descriptions of the units, divisions being moved from one sector to the next.  If you are a military historian, this book would be fascinating.  If you are just interested in the battle, this becomes tedious reading.  A good fifty pages is devoted to where and when units were moved.  This is not interesting.  The first portion of the book is good reading.  At around page 110, the movement of troops becomes dominant, and this is hard to follow.  The last three chapters give a summary view of what happened as a result of the battle.  Read selectively in this book.
