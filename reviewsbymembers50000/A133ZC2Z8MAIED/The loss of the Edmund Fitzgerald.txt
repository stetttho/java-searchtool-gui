 I read this book in less than a day.  It is an interesting history of one of the largest ore freighters and the infamous sinking of this great vessel.  MacInnis does a great job of boiling the history and the tragic sinking of this ship down into an easy to read 120 pages.  This is great story, and I was surprised that it took so little time to read this book and understand the tragedy of 29 dead men. This book is a good history of the ship and the brevity of it makes it a quick read.  None of the real far fetched accounts (UFOs) for the explanation of the tragedy are included in this book. The details of the two explorers filming the results of the ship on the bottom are also detailed.  MacInnis makes them out as quick buck artists working the tragedy for all its worth. I am less sure about this, but the book is a good read.
