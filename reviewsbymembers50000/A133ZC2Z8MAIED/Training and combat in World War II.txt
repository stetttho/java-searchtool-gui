 Vernon was a naval pilot in World War II and flew Hellcats.  This story is his experiences during the later part of the conflict.  Much of his story concerns his experiences during his training at various naval bases.  This experiences relate to the difficulty in learning to fly and qualifying as a naval aviator. Other expiences such as dating and drinking and playing cards are also related in this time period.  The last 40-50 pages dealt with combat experience and how he adjusts to losses through both training and combat.   I enjoyed this read very much, but there are so many books just like his out on the market.  There is no unique material in here, just a story of an average man making an adjustment to his life to fight for his nation.  Our nation in built upon the sacrifices of young people like him.
