 I have read a number of books about the Civil War in Spain.  This is by far the most even handed when it describes the atrocities performed by both the Loyalists and Nationalists.  For contemporary writers, it is easy to lambast Franco and his Nationalists for the evils they performed and overlook what the Communists and Anarchists performed on the upper classes and Church.  Goldston does not do this.  He describes both evils and was fair to both sides. This book has both illustrations and pictures and was an easy read of 130 pages.  If the reader is looking for more detail, read elsewhere.
