 This is a short book that tends to blame the West for everything which has gone wrong with the Middle East.  I think there is blame to share for everything but this book blames Great Britain and France after World War I and the United States during and after the Nixon Administration.  Throughout the book, it labels the Israelis the aggressors.  Throughout all the book, it absolves the Soviets and Arabs of creating any problems in this theater. This book is an introduction to Western policy toward the Middle East, but I think it fools many into believing the West is to blame for the problems of this region.  I think there are many truths in this short book, but for the unthinking reader it is just another book that blames the West.  This is a complex region and indeed the West has committed plenty of errors here.  However, many of the problems have been committed by the Arabs and other nationalities that live here.  Shlaim needs to focus where the Arab and Muslim World along with Israel have gone wrong, not blame the West for the problems of societies that have not stepped into the 21st Century. I don't buy all what the author is trying to convey in this book.  The reader looking for an introduction to this region probably should go to another book for a more balanced read.
