 A nice book about the fall of Ferdinand E. Marcos.  Marcos was indeed a tyrant and dictator of the old school.  His time was over by 1986, and he went through the motions of campaigning for an election.  His blatant fraud of the election spurred a group of military leaders on toward a coup de etat.  This small group of conspirators planned an assault on the palance and taking the first lady and President captive.  When they were discovered prior to the coup, the plotters holed up in an army base.  Cardinal Sin urged Fillopinos to support the plotters and in four days the whole rotten edifice of the Marcos regime came tumbling down.  Some things I didn't like about this book.  There was little mention of the Aquino assassination.  This was the beginning of the end of the Marcos regime.  Also, one can sense this Canadian author was anti-American, and it shows with his writing.  Johnson portrays the Marcos regime as a ruthless dictatorship.  I am not sure that this may be the case compared by world standards.  The author worked in PR of China and that regime is more ruthless than the Marcos dictatorship.  All things are relative.  Overall a good read about how a dictator came crashing down in four days.
