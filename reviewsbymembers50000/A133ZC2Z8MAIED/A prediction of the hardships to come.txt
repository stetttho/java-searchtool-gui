 This is the fourth book I have read from Mackey.  She is a very good writer with great knowledge of the Middle East.  This book has very limited accounts of what she found in Iraq, but investigates the coming conflict well.  She details how an occupation of this country would lead to a Civil War between the Shiite, Sunni, and Kurd groups.  How right she was.  Mackey details the short history of Iraq.  This country is at the center of civilization in the Middle East, but few know of the disparite elements that make up the population.  When the British took three provinces from the Ottoman Empire and put them together, the world should have known this was an artificial state.  When they imposed the Sharifian Feisal I on the throne and put the Sunnis in power, they were asking for trouble.  Since that time, government in Iraq has gone from bad to worse.  Saddam or the Buthcher of Baghdad was the worst of all.  What is left out is all the problems the Americans have faced in Iraq since that time.  The author can righly state that I told you so.  For those interested in the conflict in Iraq, this is a nice, informative read.  Mackey always does a good job of writing her books.
