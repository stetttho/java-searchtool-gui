 If one wants an good reading experience on the fighter jocks in World War II, this is not the book.  Abner who must be pushing eighty now, writes about his experiences as a fighter pilot in the good war.  However the writing is all over the place.  First we hear about his childhood, then his romance and training, and then finally about his air experiences over occupied Europe. Abner had fifty plus combat missions.  We hear about the loss of fighter pilots, and his revenge on one hapless German pilot. What I don't like in this book are the letters written to his family after the fact.  Abner must have read about the war after his experiences, and then included his experiences in these letters.  This is disturbing since it is so much filler in a book which is already short (150 pages).  There are other books out there which are more informative on the fighter jocks experiences.  This is not one of the good books. I admire Abner as a hero for his experiences in World War II.  However this is not a good book to read.
