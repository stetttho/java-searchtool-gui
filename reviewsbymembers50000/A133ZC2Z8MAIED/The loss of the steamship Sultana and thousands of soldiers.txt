 This is a little known event in the Civil War era.  The Sultana was carrying released Union prisoners of war from Vicksburg to Camp Chase in Ohio.  Due to an imcomplete repair of one of the four boilers and the vast over crowding of the steamship, there was a huge explosion a few miles above Memphis on the Mississippi River.  The explosion and sinking resulted in the loss of between one-two thousand people, mostly soldiers.    Potter, who is a lawyer by trade, investigates why there were so many soldiers on board and why the boiler repair was incomplete.  His theory is that the Captain-Mason bribed the Head Quartermaster Hatch so that all the released soldiers were placed on board the Sultana rather than two other steamships.  The Captain also hastened the repairs of the boiler rather than take the ship out of service.  This set the situation up for the accident.  These two factors caused the ship to roll much and the boilers were affected.  When the boilers blew, the resulting fire doomed a great majority of men.  Potter also describes life in the Confederate prisoner of war camps and what it was like for those who had to live a life in one.  These soldiers were indeed weakened to the point where they could not muster much energy to save themselves when the steamship was sinking.  When they went into the water, most drowned.  This is a great short read on a little known event of the Civil War.  Potter did a great job writing a very informative history of a little known tragedy.
