 This is a New York Times book.  The book has taken a collection of stories of different types to paint a picture of the Spanish Civil War.  These stories reflect the internationalization of the war with Germany and Italy's active commitment.   I learned some things from this book that are missing in other books on this war.  First, Nazi Germany's Naval blockade of the Spanish coast, while actively helping Franco and the rebels.  Also the Loyalists targeting of Nazi naval units, plus their barbarism against conservatives and clericals.  Many contemporary books portray the Rebels as the villians, but perhaps both sides can share this label to an equal extent.  Since these are stories that appear in the newspapers, some of the facts are wrong and this is why I gave it three stars.
