 Helm does a good job discribing the sinking of this heavy cruiser and the five days the survivors spent in the water facing the  hazards of sharks, sun, no food or water, and the negative effects on the crew.  With the new forward and summary by the  skipper of the sub Indianapolis, their research and wording was  quick and to the point.  The skipper of the cruiser may have  warranted a court martial, but was it fair--probably not.  The court martial was more a bow to public pressure and focused on how the Navy was itself to blame for the sinking since no escort was sent to protect the ship, and nobody noticed the ship missing at Leyte.  Better to throw someone to the dogs, than let the Navy assume blame for the 800 odd deaths at sea.
