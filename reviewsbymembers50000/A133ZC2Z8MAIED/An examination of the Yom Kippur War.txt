 Allen does a solid if unimpressive job documenting the Yom Kippur War.  The book has both an Arab, Israeli, and American perspective, but it leans to the Israeli side.  All the battles are detailed, as well as some of the politics from 1967-73.   Allen is much more generous towards the Israelis than other books.   The perspectives in this book are pretty stark.  The Soviets were trying to stir up trouble in the Middle East to enhance their position.  The Egyptians, Syrians are both portrayed as the aggressors in this and past conflicts.  Other Arab governments are portrayed as opportunists, reacting to the conflict by piling on.  The rest of the Third World are portrayed as gullible to the propaganda of the Arab and Soviet sides.  Not a pretty picture, but perhaps true. I enjoyed the portrayal of some of characters in this story, especially Ariel Sharon.  Sharon seems to have caused as much problems with other Israelis as he now does with the Palestinians.  The Yom Kippur War may have settled things with Israel and Egypt, but the conflict in the Middle East still simmers.  This is an interesting read on this conflict.
