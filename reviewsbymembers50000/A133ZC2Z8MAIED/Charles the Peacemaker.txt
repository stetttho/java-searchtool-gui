 If it were up to Karl I, the Austrian Empire might have become a federal empire, and World War I would never have happened.  As it was, the old Emperor Franz Joseph survived two more years into WWI, and any remaining hopes for a revitalized Austrian-Hungarian Empire were shattered.  This old book is the story of the last of the Hapsburg line, who died on a small Portuguese island three years after the end of the First World War.  He was an accidental Emperor, since three men before him in line died young.  His is an interesting story, and the author relates it to the reader in a personal story.  The author also knew the son and widow of the last Hapsburg Emperor. This is a rather old book (c 1968) and very little has been written of this man.  It is surprising that many books focus on Wilheim II of Germany, but few take the effort of Karl I.  Their personalities were different, but if the world has more Karls, and less Wilheims, it would be a safer place.  A good book about a great man.
