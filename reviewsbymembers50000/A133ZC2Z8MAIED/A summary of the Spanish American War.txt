 At a little over 200 pages, this book covers the main battles of the Spanish American War.  These include the two naval battles off Santiago and Manila, and the land campaigns in Puerto Rico,Cuba and the Philippine Islands.  So if you are into the military aspect of the war, this is the book for you.  If you need the political reasons, see Trask's book about the war or another called Empire by Default.  This is a good summary of the war, but not an explanation for the reason of the war.  However, the book is well written and very readable.
