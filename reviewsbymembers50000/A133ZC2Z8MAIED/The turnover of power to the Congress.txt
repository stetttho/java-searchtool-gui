 The author does a good job of detailing why George Washington was a great man.  Rather than become a King or dictator after the War of Independence, he returned his commission to the Congress and returned to Mount Vernon.  This was after eight years of separation from his home.  His only desire was to depart from the public stage and resume his private life.  This was unlike most people who would have clung to power.  Washington wanted to become a private citizen again.  This book details his change from a military general to a private citizen. Washington takes control of New York from the departing British, says farewell to his soldiers and other officers, returns the commission to the Congress in Annapolis, and gets home in time for a Mount Vernon Christmas Eve.  This brief period says alot what Washington was and why people wanted him to be their leader. Weintraub does a good summary job of describing this two week episode in the life of the first American President.  By his example, the military would always be controlled by the civilian government.  The importance of Washington is shown in this short story and good read.
