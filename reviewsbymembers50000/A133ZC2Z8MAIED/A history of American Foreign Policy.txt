 I picked this book up in the discount section and was prepared to read a boring analysis of American foreign policy.  I was surprised because this is a concise history of the development of American foreign policy.  Professor McDougall also destroys some myths viewed as facts by the American public.  One item is the Monroe Doctrine.  McDougall details what the Monroe doctrine was in reality, not what they tell you in the American history books.  The book is divided into two parts, Promised Land (Old Testament) and Crusader State (New Testament).  In each section, there are four chapters detailing the development and stages of American foreign policy.  I thought the outline and stages of American foreign policy was a nice touch in showing the reader how different things influenced American foreign policy. This is a great read for those trying to figure out American foreign policy.  I actually learned how to view our foreign policy in the light of these eight stages in development and how Iraq and Vietman figure into the equation.  This was written before the present Iraq war so it would be great to see how Professor McDougall views the present conflict.  A good read.
