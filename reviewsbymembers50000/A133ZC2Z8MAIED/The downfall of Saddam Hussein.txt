 A nice little picture book about the War in Iraq.  This book only explores the 2003 War that brought Saddam down.  It does not cover the insurgentcy after the collaspe of Saddam's government.  It covers the 21 days to bring Saddam down.  As always, Time's pictures are without equal.  There is not much meat in this book about the conflicts raging in both Iraq and the United States about starting the war.  If one wants to flip through the pages to learn about the 21 day campaign, this is an OK book.  If one wants to find more about this conflict, you need to read elsewhere.
