 The author and his wife are converted Jews who discover love, faith, and forgiveness during World War Two.  This is a religious book and much of the content is religious in nature, so if the reader is looking for a human interest story, then plan on reading material debating some aspects of the Bible.  Anne Frank also makes a brief appearance in this book.  In this book, there is also great sorrow as people are sent to the death camps.  Hetty and Elly's parents are sent to the death camps.  Despite all this, Ernest has the ability to forgive his captors and tormentors.  For this he is commended, because I don't think I could forgive them. As I said, this is a religious publication.  It is a short and easy read, and the personal stories propel the book forward.  However, there is a lot of quotations from Bible passages, so for those that are not interested in that, this might be a trying book.  Also, the author cannot see why other Jews don't believe as he does, so there is a certain amount of moralizing in this book.
