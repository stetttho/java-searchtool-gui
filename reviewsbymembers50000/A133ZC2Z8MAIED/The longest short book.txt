 Well, first let me say I admire Timerman and his opposition to the dirty war in Argentina.  I read his Prisoner without a Name, Cell without a Number and was moved by this book.  He suffered greatly because of his liberalism and for being a Jew.  I also liked his book about Cuba.  This book I did not like.  Why?  Because Timerman raves on about his dislike for Begin, Sharon, and Arafat.  I thought I was going through another root canal.  Fortunately this book is not long, and the pain was soon over. Timerman talks on about how he thinks Begin is a lunatice and crazy.  Well, I don't think he was neither.  He made a calculated move to end the Palestinian terror in Lebanon.  Unfortunately he chose the wrong man in Sharon to do it for him.  Sharon implemented his own reprisals and now we have a radicalized population in Lebanon.  At present, Sharon is playing the same game in the West Bank and Gaza, and I don't think the results will be different.  Timerman rants on and on, and the reader is wondering--maybe I should just stop reading.  The book is short but be prepared for a lot of ranting and raving.
