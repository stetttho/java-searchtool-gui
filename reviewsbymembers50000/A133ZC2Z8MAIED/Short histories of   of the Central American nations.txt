 Krauss was one of those reporters who worked Central America in the 1980s and 1990s and reported as an independent news correspondent.  In this book, he gives his views on the six countries of Central America (he left out Belize) and gives a brief history of each nation.  I think Krauss was both fair and objective in his views of each of these nations.  Krauss details the violence endemic in El Salvador and Guatemala.  He also finds the less violent ways of Costa Rica and Honduras amazing in an area so prone to violence.  Nicaragua and Panama are the middlings in terms of violence.  He also tries to view recent events through the prism of each respective nation's history.  There is a lot of insight in this book.  Other reporters would have just reported what they saw and mixed in their own political viewpoints.   The book is an interesting read with some very dry spells.  I found the 60 page chapter on El Salvador a hard slog to get through and understand.  The other chapters seemed to be OK.  One has to be interested in Central America to read this.  Since I have visited all these countries, I found the material in this book of interest in understanding these countries.  This is probably a better book than Buckley's Violent Neighbors.
