 This is a good read.  Lots of photos plus good summary writing on the history of the Soviet Union.  As they say, a photo is worth a thousand words, and there are a lot of good photos in this book.  The summary writing of the history backs up the photos, although for further detail, you will need to look elsewhere.  Also, a great intro by Robert Conquest who has written some fine books about Stalin's regime.   I think photo books serve a good purpose in stirring the interest of the reader.  If a reader is interested in the Soviet Union, this is a good place to start.  I was especially interested in the chapter on the Breshnev era, since I visited the Soviet Union during the Olympic boycott period.  Great photos, good writing.  For further reading about the Soviet Union, look for books by Robert Conquest, W. Bruce Lincoln, and Richard Pipes.
