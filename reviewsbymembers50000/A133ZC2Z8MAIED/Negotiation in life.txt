 The author makes the point that negotiation is not just for the buyer and/or seller.  It is for everybody.  Husbands negotiate with wives.  Children negotiate with their parents.  Workers negotiate with their bosses.  To be an effective negotiator, you need to know yourself and your wants, your opponents wants and needs, and organize and plan your negotiation.  In this way, you can learn to have negotiations and agreements that satisfy the wants of both you and your opponent.  Ineffective negotiators will not meet their needs and become unhappy.   This is a great book to read to learn more about yourself and how you rationalize your decision making.  Negotiation is indeed a great tool in everyday life (home and business).  I commend the author for writing on this topic.  This is a rare book that will help the reader with both his family and business.  The only negative is the author putting much too much focus on theories when simple stories would suffice.  This is why I gave this book a four star.
