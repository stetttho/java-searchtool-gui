 For those people who thought Pearl Harbor brought us into the Second World War, Reynolds argues that FDR's actions were bringing us closer to an alliance with Churchill's Great Britain and Stalin's USSR.  Pearl Harbor was the last action which convinced the American public that war was necessary.  Before that, Reynolds argues that the isolationist mood in the U.S. was high and oppossed to more involvement in Europe.  Roosevelt helped as much as possible through the destroyer deal and lend lease to help Great Britain and the USSR.  If it hadn't been for Pearl Harbor, NAZI Germany may have overwhelmed the USSR and Great Britain.  In this thesis, he also argues that signal intelligence was missed which resulted in Pearl Harbor, but there was no conspiracy. Reynolds book is somewhat dry, but the details show how FDR worked to get us into the good war.  He led the USA into public opinion about the reasons why the country should support the Soviet Union and Great Britain.
