 Unlike some of the other reviewers, I don't think this book was a great read.  The stories are unique, no doubt.  However bringing them together leads to a disjoint and is not smooth.  One story talked about the Western Front, then the next dealt with the Eastern Front.  There was even a story in there from a Russian soldier.  I tried to interpret these stories into some theme, but the only thing I got was the disorganized nature of the German Army.  The last story from a Waffen SS recruit bordered on unbelieveable, and some of the interpretation mention that some may not be true.  Perhaps a book called Berlin Dance of Death is a better book on the subject, although it is written by only one soldier. This is an OK read, but there are better books out there from German soldiers.  The stories are alright, if the reader is familiar with the last battles of the Third Reich.
