 I think one moment in this book speaks for what happened.  That is when the Emperor Augustius awakens and asks the night "Where are my three legions Varus?".  Rome lost between 15,000 to 20,000 soldiers in this massacre of a battle, and there is very little that historians know of this.  Hats off to the author for having the ability to piece together a credible story on how the three legions were defeated by the Germans.  The author pieces together the various histories, along with the archaeological evidence and gives a good rendition of how the battle may have been fought.  I was surprised the other reviewers gave such a low rating for the book because of how he came to the conclusions.  They probably would not like anything if it was not the conclusive proof, and that will probably never happen.  This is a fairly short book about a little known event.  The author should be complemented for having the ability to write an interesting account of the battle, without much known history. A nice effort.
