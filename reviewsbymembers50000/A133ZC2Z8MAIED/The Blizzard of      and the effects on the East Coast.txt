 Another fine book for young readers by Jim Murphy.  I was not aware of the history of the March, 1888 Blizzard on the East Coast and this very readable short book gave me the low down of the tragedy people had to endure when two storm systems met off the East Coast.  The book focused the attention on New York, but other localities were also included.  Several hundred people died as a result of this storm, so I was surprised when I read this book.  The author modeled this book for young readers, but it can be of interest to the adult.  In a short read, an adult can get a brief history of this terrible storm. A good little read for those interested in tragedies.  The authors writings are smooth, and the flow is good.  It is an easy read.
