 This is the definitive history of African independence.  Since the first states got their independence, the big man has taken over and used the state as his personal piggy bank.  Meredith defines the history of the 50+ countries that make up Africa and tells of the often brutal and corrupt rule of the big man.  It is no wonder that year after year, Western governments have been approached about bailing out a third world African government.  There are few success stories here:  Botswana, Senegal, and Tanzania.  The rest of the countries are the most poorest and most corrupt in the world.  This author does not really provide any solutions to the huge crisis that Africa now faces.  Poor government and the rule of the big man obviously have to stop.  Other conflicts plague Africa such as AIDS, tribal war, and huge debts.  It is sad to stay that since colonialism, the people of this continent are worse off than when they were the subjects of a European state. African leaders blame the legacy of slavery and colonialism, but it now appears they are their own worst enemies.  This is a great history of the misrule of African states.  Most of the major and minor states are portrayed here.  The author did a great job in organizing the material in a nice easy to read format.  Great book.
