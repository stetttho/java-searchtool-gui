 This book is a novel, or historical fiction as the long introduction will point out.  The author Smith wrote this and had the publishers say it was the journal of Davy Crockett.  It isn't.  Smith read some books ghost written by Crockett, and then wrote this story in a similar fashion.  That being said, it is a good and entertaining read.  However, it is not true, so fellow historians beware. Crockett is a colorful figure in American history.  I can't say I know much about him, but this story places him in a very favorable light.  The saying much attributed to Crockett about the voters of Tennessee going to hell, but he was going to Texas is one of my favorites.  This is a great short read and I much recommend it.
