 This book was published back in 1950 and is a collection of humorous sketches of historical figures.  Cuppy's presentation of humor leaves a lot to be desired.  He makes a joke of some of the great figures of history, but since most of the jokes are dated, I laughed little.  I wonder why a publisher would reprint a book that was so dated it would appeal to few people.  I read this book for the purpose of trying to either learn something or laugh, and I didn't do either.   For those who know something about history, this would not be a good read since it is neither humorous or factional.  For those who know little of history, this book would be a disaster.
