 Personally, I like this author and I have a few of his books.  This one was an average read because in a brief 200 pages, Fest describes the last days of Hitler.  Trevor Roper's book even though ancient gives a better picture of the last days of Hitler than Fest's book.  In Fest's book, one gets glimpses of Hitler in his last days of life.  Gone are the great expectations of German Empire, and one can get a glimpse of the crazy man who led Germany for 12 years.  Fest gives only glimpses of Hitler and life in the bunker.  One cannot get a definitive account of all the activities of that period.  One can get a better image with Trever Roper's book. I enjoyed some of the information in this book, but definitive it is not.  There are better books out there than this, so if one wants a summary, this is a nice book.  However if one wants a more through book, they should look elsewhere.
