 Three years after the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Eastern Front was still holding and the Soviets were still stalemated there.  During the same time as the Normandy Invasion, Soviet forces made hints at the southern front and then delivered the knock out blow against Belarus in the Center Front.  Hitler ordered his generals not to give up any significant territory and the result was 300,000 soldiers (28 divisions) being surrounded and destroyed.  Hitler's generalship was indeed faulty.  The campaign was called Operation Bagration and it was a larger disaster than Stalingrad.  It destroyed the foundations of the German Army and shortened the war. This is a nice read about an unknown operation.  Few in the West know what the Russians did in defeating Nazi Germany.  This book shows how the Soviets took on the bulk of Hitler's forces and won.  This book describes the military aspect of this campaign.  Lots of maps to show the progress of the campaign.
