 A good short review of the founding and history of the U. S. Navy.  The main premise of the book is the transition of the Navy from a coastal patrol and merchant raiding fleet to one that then equaled and surpassed the British Navy. The previous reviewer talked about the financial aspect  of being a global fleet.  He must have read between the lines.   This is  certainly a good overview of the U. S. Navy.
