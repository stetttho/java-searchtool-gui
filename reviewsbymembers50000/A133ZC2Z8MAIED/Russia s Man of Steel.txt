 Marrin always does a superior job of boiling down the essentials of an aspect of history.  In this book, he examines Stalin and his bloody regime in Russia.  In this book, Stalin is examined as a rebel, politician, leader, father, and dictator.  Marrin is right when he states that in terms of body count, Stalin was far worse than Hitler.  Stalin killed and starved more of his own citizens than Hitler killed in the European theater of World War II and the Holocaust. I think this is a wonderful little book which a young person can digest easily.  The subject of the book may be inhuman, but the subject matter is readily understood.  There were some typos in the book (WWII started on 9/1/39, not 9/1/40).  Otherwise a solid read.
