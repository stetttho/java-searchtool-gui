 I have read two other of Murphy's books about disasters, and this is along the same line.  Murphy breaks down the Yellow Fever epidemic which savaged Philadelphia from August, 1793 to October, 1793.  During this plague, 4,000 to 5,000 people died in the largest American city at the time.  Both the Federal and State governments were incapacitated from this plague and had no control.  George Washington moved back to Mount Vernon for several months.  The rich fled for rural areas.  What was left were poor people left to fend for themselves and some die hard patriots that tried to help.  Murphy tells the story of the plague and how the sickness ran its course.  The city eventually survived and made a full recovery. This was a good read, although not like Murphy's other books.  A young reader can easily cover this book in two days.  This is a good read for adults too.  Another good read from Murphy.
