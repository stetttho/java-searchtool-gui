 Eisenhower's son writes very well, and this is the third book I have read of his.  He writes like Ambrose, so the flow of these books is good.  In this book, Eisenhower tackles the subject of his father as he would like to remember him--that as the General and Supreme Allied Commander.  This is not a biography but rather glimspes of his father and his interaction with some other famous personalities such as Marshall, Pershing, De Galle, Churchill, Patton,and Montgomery. Some of the stories Eisenhower tells in this book deal with the working relationship of his father with these persons.  Montgomery was by far the most difficult of these persons.  What surprised me was how Ike regarded De Galle in a very favorable light.  Why Eisenhower talked about these persons and not others like Roosevelt and Bradley also amazed me.  Why were these people excluded from the book? Otherwise, another great read from Eisenhower.  I hope he has another few books left in him so the history reader can enjoy his work.
