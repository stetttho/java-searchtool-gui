 This is a fascinating story of how the French Army almost crumbled in 1917.  General Nivelle started an offensive which almost cost the French their Army.  When you have troops marching off to the front and immitating the Bah, Bah of sheep, you know you have lost the confidence of your troops.  Two men rose from the ranks and helped the Army regain its balance.  Philippe Petain rested the Army (no more offensives for the time being) and Clemenceau (the Tiger) helped the French stay in the war to ultimate victory.  A series of trials of mutineers also stabilized the French Army and weeded out defeatists.  When the French Army went back onto the offensives in late 1918, the war sealed the fate of Germany.  This is a great read about a little known event in the Great War.  If the French Army had cracked, history might have been vastly different.  As it was, France and Great Britain defeated Germany.
