 This is a quick easy read for those wanting to know about the end of the German super battleship.  The book is from the fifies, but the recent reprint gives a fictionalized concept of what happened when the German super battleship ventured out into the North Atlantic and met its fate.  Since there were few survivors from the ship and almost none from the Hood, C. S. Forester recreates what could have been said.  For young adults, this is a good read.  I read this almost thirty years ago, and decided to read this again.   For one needing more information, this is not the book.  It reads like a novel, but gives an overview of the struggle for the Atlantic in World War II.  This is an easy read though.
