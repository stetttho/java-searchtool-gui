 This book explains why the Serbs did the genocides of the 1990s. The author explains how the Serbs came to feel like victims and performed some of the worst attrocities of the after Cold War era. I think some of the explanations have great value to how we understand these troubled people.  1.) Serbs viewed themselves as the bulwark against the East and the Turks.  As the author vividly demonstrates, the Serbs were more often the allies of the Turks in the invasion of Europe than adversaries.  The Serbs often allied themselves with the Turks against other Christian peoples like the Bulgars. 2.) Serbs glorified the use of violence against their enemies.  Their most valued weapon was the knife.  Glorification still takes place in modern novels and the Serbs are always the good guys. 3.) The Orthodox religion is tied so closely to the state that it is nor an effective opposition to the bloody policies of the police state.  In fact, the Orthodox Church often condones and revels in the attrocities against the other religions.  This is an interesting read for the academic reader.  It serves as one theory of why the Serbs did what they did in the 1990s.  I am not sure if the author has an ax to grind with the Serbs, but the justification for what he says is in the book.  A nice read.
