 As a previous reviewer has stated, this is a good short history of Winston Churchill.  Keegan does a competent job of giving us the short version on this great man.  However it is not really inspired writing, and not a page turner.  I found myself plodding through this book and wondering when the tempo would change.  It didn't.  All of the highlights of Churchill's life are there, it just didn't flow well. There are many great books about Winston Churchill.  Some comprise several volumes.  I would rate Manchester the best in terms of biography.  Keegan's book is a good first start for those who don't know much of Churchill.
