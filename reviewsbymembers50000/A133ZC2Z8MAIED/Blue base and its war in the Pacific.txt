 A excellent biography of the carrier U.S.S. Hornet and her one year life.  What she lacked in longevity, she sure made up for in activity.  Her airmen were a deciding factor in robbing the Japanese of their finest pilots.  Once her first line pilots were gone, the Japanese had few replacements and at that point, America was producing its second generation of carriers and another crop of pilots.  The Hornet was indeed the last gift of the pre war U.S. Navy.  Indeed, this carrier at one point was the only active serving carrier in the Pacific.  It was indeed a ship that held the line.  After her loss, no more fleet carriers were lost in the war. The author did a nice job of detailing the life of this carrier. He pointed out her weaknesses and that of the planes she carried. After perhaps the Enterprise, Lexington, and Yorktown, she was one of the famous ships of the war.  A nice read about a famous ship.
