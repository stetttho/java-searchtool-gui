 I was really touched by this book.  This is the story of Bill and his final battle with cancer.  This man survived the battle of Guadalcanal by his wits and bravery.  He was in the signal corps which basically meant he strung telephone wire between different front lines and rear areas.  His story is his experience of life and death on the island of Gaudalcanal.  The book also has commentary from his doctor on his final battle with cancer in 1997.  This is truly a touching story, much like Duty. The veterans of World War II contributed much to the greatness of this country.  Bill and Ben's sacrifices made this country great and that is why I love to read these stories.  It is sad that Bill could not experience the satisfaction of seeing his story published.
