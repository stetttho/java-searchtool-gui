 An excellent summary of the Spanish Civil War.  This is an illustrated book of the war, and Preston is a well regarded historian of this event.   This book is less than two hundred pages, but the summary and photos convey the brutality of this war.  I think Preston gives equal coverage to both the rebels and loyalists.  Also, a good portrait of the major characters in this war, and the politics involved which resulted in the Civil War. For a quick summary of the war, this is good book to start with.
