 A great read about the little known Communist regime in Romania. After watching the Velvet Revolution in person in Prague, I wondered wheather I should travel to Bucharest to see the effects of another Communist regime.  A month later Nicholae Ceausescu and his wife were dead.  For those who don't know much about Romania, this book gives a political overview of the country's history. Ceausescu was a dispictable little man who had an even more wretched wife Elena.  Not only did he run the country into the ground, but his politics destroyed whatever trust Romanians had in their government.  Both Ceausescus were semi literate who had a penchant for collecting honors, degrees, and loot.   This book details how a uneducated man wormed his way into a small Communist party, and eventually ran the country.  It details not only his rise and fall, but also that of the country.  Ceausescu's successors were once his proteges.  For more information on Romania after Ceausescu, read A Hole in the Flag.
