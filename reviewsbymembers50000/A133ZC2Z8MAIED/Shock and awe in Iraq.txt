 This is a picture book on the war that toppled Saddam from his dictatorship.  As one of the previous reviewers have already noted, it is a coffee table book.  The pictures are great as they show the reality of war--innocent civilians including children being wounded and killed.  Not surprisely, I found the book to be pro war and anti Saddam.  The period detailed was the initial invasion and the aftermath.  People were generally pro-American and welcomed the Americans, and this shows in the pictures of U.S. soldiers being kissed.  Much has changed since this book has been published.  At present, it does not demonstrate the true feeling of Iraqis or Americans about the war now. There is not much to read in this book.  There are a few slivers of info, but overall a person will not gain any great insight into why the war was fought. The pictures are great, and this would be the only reason to purchase the book.
