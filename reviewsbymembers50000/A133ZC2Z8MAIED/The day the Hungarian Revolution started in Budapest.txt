 Meray does a good job in detailing the 24 hour period in which Hungarians threw out the dictator Ernoe Geroe and installed Imre Nagy as the Prime Minister.  His book also refutes point by point the claims of the successive government of Janos Kadar that this was a counter revolution backed by capitalist and fascist elements.  The political police(AVO) are shown in their savagery in first trying to contain the conflict and then succumbing to the Revolution. Tibor Meray was a friend of Imre Nagy but his book in written in an unbiased way.  He even quotes sources from the Kadar government and then refutes their falsehoods.  Meray has much to be bitter about since his friend Nagy and others were executed by the Hungarian goverment.  The book does not dwell on this but the history of the event.  Much is written about the first day, but the last hundred pages of the book detail the defeat and aftermath of the revolt.  A fine book about this terrible event.
