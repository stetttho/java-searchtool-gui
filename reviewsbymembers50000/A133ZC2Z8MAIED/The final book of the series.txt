 I have read Burgett's first three books and they are great reads. In comparison with those first three books, this is an average read.  Why?  Very little action.  It almost seems like a travel guide with Burgett saying in essence--I went here and then I went there.  Burgett is a good author, but I think he is trying to capitalize on his combat experience.  His first three books detail the combat experience, but this fourth book could have been cut down to fifty pages, and attached onto his last book.  Because of the publisher, they make Burgett get another book out of very minimal material.  I don't think there is a fifth book here Don, so don't try. That said, Burgett is a great author, so please read his first three books about the Normandy Invasion, Battle of the Bulge, and the Holland Campaign.  For the WWII historian, these show the true experiences of an American soldier.
