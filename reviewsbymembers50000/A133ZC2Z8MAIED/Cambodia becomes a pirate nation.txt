 This is another book where U.S. military personnel were left behind to suffer their fate while the government pursued its own agenda.  Three brave men from a machine gun squad were left behind to suffer their fate at the hands of the Khymer Rouge.  The reason for these Marines being on this small Cambodian island was because of the Cambodians using piracy as a way to harass international shipping.  A U.S. ship called the S.S. Mayaguez was siezed by Khymer Rouge gunboats.  The author does a good job detailing the seizure of the ship and the decision by Ford and the U.S. government to use force to get the ship back and rescue the crew members.  Since these events took all of four days, their was not adequate planning for the military sequence.  The result was 41 military deaths to rescue 40 crew members of the Mayaguez.  More than just people were at stake.  Ford did not want a repeat of the Pueblo incident, when the U.S. was already at a low point for the loss of Indochina.  Ford wanted to show the U.S. could still project power and could not be trifled with.  These four days are well told in the book.  The author then unlocks the fact that three Marines were left behind because of the inadequate pull out.  These men suffered a terrible fate.  One was shot outright and the other two were taken, put in prison and then pummeled to death.  The U.S. military left these guys to die.  This is a good book about a story that needed to be told.  More care should be called for in these emergency situations so we can prevent unnecessary U.S. deaths.  Camdodia was a pirate nation that needed to be dealt with harshly.  Unfornately the U.S. didn't exercise proper care.  The author relates this story well.
