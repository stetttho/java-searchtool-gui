 While Europe was in the dark during the Middle Ages, the Middle East was the center of tolerance, learning, and political development.  Sometime during then and now, the West (Europe and North America) became the leaders with the rest of the world falling behind.  While some areas (Far East Asia) have caught up with the West, the Middle Eastern countries (except Turkey) have stagnated and no longer count in the economy (other than oil extraction).  How did this happen?  Lewis seeks the answers for the stagnation of the Middle East.  The focus is on Islam and how to an extent it has held up the Middle Eastern countries from developing  the society, economy, and political structure.  Lewis details how Turk, Persian, and Arab societies have developed, and what keeps them from moving into modernity.  Not only are these societies stagnating, but real risks are at stake if these countries turn fundamentalist.  These risks will confront the West. I good summary of why the Middle East is failings its own people.  Lewis cites plenty of examples to give his views credence.  A pretty good read.
