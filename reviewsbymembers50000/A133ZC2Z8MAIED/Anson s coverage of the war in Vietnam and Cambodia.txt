 I came close not to buying this book in a second hand book store.  I read Anson's views on Richard Nixon, and found them not very objective, so when I saw this book about the Vietnam War I was not sure.  The book is very readable, and Anson makes sure to detail his own weaknesses in the book, especially his rocky marriage and use of drugs and alcohol.  He details his coverage of the war.  Also details his views on the Cambodian government and their Vietnamese massacres.  He is sypathetic to the NVA, even though several of his friends were killed by them.  His personal stories are the best in detailing the corruption of Cambodian and South Vietnamese governments.
