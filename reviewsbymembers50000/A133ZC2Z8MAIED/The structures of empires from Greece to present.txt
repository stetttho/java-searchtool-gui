 For such a difficult subject, Pagden does a good job of creating a readable book detailing the rise and fall of European Empires.  From Alexander the Great, and the Roman Empire to the decline of the British Empire, Pagden details the rise of these empires and why they fell.  In the end, it was the weakness of the colonizers along with the rise of nationalism which spurred the end of all empires.  Pagden also details that some of the early empires were not racially divided, but with the rise of science and some of the new European nation states, racism along with slavery reared its ugly head.  Commerce and the search for raw materials spurred on the exploitation of these colonies, and reduced the natives to subject status. This is a nice theory book about why empires came about.  It gives a lot of information in a few short pages.
