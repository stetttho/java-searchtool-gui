 Whiting's books are good reads, even though he has written so many of them.  This is a book which describes the rivalry of the Allies in breaking the final barrier into the Thousand Year Reich.  By crossing the Rhine, Germany was exposed to the military spearheads of the Western Allies into the very heart of the Nazi Empire.  Competition was between the English, Americans, Canadians, and the French.  Whiting paints a poor portrait of Montgomery and his competitors of Patton, Bradley, and Hodges.  The American generals are shown as disregarding the orders of the Supreme Commander in order to sabotage the reputation of the "Old Fart" Montgomery.  In the end, Montgomery came in third for the race of bouncing the Rhine.  Hodges and Bradley beat him in crossing the Rhine.  Despite all this, thousands of lives were spent in competition between the Allied Generals. Whiting does an adequate job of describing the various battles before and after the crossings.   This is the fourth book I have read from Whiting and I believe his books inspire a good interest in World War II.
