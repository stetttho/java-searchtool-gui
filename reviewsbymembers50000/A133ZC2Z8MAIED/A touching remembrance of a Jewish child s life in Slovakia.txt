 I liked this book even though I didn't rate it highly. Breznitz did a good job detailing his life in wartime Slovakia and his placement in a Catholic orphanage.  His troubles surviving the war are touching.  No one should be made to feel this sense of tragedy.  What got in the way was Shlomo's rationalizing in the book.  Some of these thoughts confused me because they made it hard to follow the story. This book is a good read detailing the suffering of one person.  However there are better books out there.  If one wants to read about the Holocaust, there are some great books out there such as the Diary of Anne Frank.
