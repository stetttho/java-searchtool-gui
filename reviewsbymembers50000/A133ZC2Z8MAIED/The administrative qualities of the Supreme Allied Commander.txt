 Overall there are several good books about Dwight Eisenhower.  The author who is British paints the administrative qualities of Eisenhower and how his contributions contributed to the Victory in Europe.  Eisenhower was impartial with all the forces under his command-whether they are American, British, Canadian, or French. Sixsmith details the plans to invade North Africa, Sicily, Italy, and France.  With the people under his command, it is a wonder how he managed to get consensus on the goals and push the team toward victory.  Sixsmith does a wonderful job of detailing all of these conflicts with the various generals and Churchill, Roosevelt, and DeGalle.  Eisenhower really was a superior administrative genius and his abilities were as good or better than George Marshall.  It was great we had Eisenhower on our side during WWII. This was a short read which detailed the military aspects of Dwight Eisenhower.  For more detail on his early life or later political life, one has to read elsewhere--perhaps Ambrose.
