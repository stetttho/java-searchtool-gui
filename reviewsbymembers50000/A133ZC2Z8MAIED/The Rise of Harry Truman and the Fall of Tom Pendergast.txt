 This is a good read for those interested in one of our Great Presidents.  It also shows the machine politics which infected Missouri in the 1930-1940s.  Tom Pendergast was the leader of the Kansas City, Missouri machine which put forward its candidates for local, state, and national politics.  The real election was not in November, but during the primary when the Democrats made the choice of who their candidates would be.  During the general election,the Pendergast machine rigged their wards well with only marginal votes for Republican candidates. It was not true democracy.  Pendergast was convicted of income tax evasion after he didn't declare bribes he "earned" in an insurance settlement scheme.  The book details Truman's 1940 Senate election campaign as he attempted to revive his fortunes following the fall of his mentor Tom Pendergast.  Truman did not forsake his mentor (neither did he mention him) but managed to defeat the seating governor and prosecutor for his Senate position. This is a short book.  The first chapter doesn't read correctly and the flow is not there.  The detail and interest are, and the following chapters have more page turning drama in them.  Truman won the campaign and must have impressed FDR since in 1944, Roosevelt gave him the Veep position.  The book also details the duplicity of FDR in his dealings with other Democrats.
