 Hoyt does a good job detailing the political life of the wartime leader of Japan.  As one of the previous reviewers noted, there is little personal information on Tojo here.  What is detailed is the struggle for the control of Japan from 1936-1945.  Tojo came out on top four months prior to Pearl Harbor.  He was not completely to blame for what happened in Japan and her conquered territories, but his guilt was great.  Hoyt does a good job of detailing why Hirohito was less to blame for the outcome of the war. Tojo was basically a spokeman for the Generals of the Army who guided the country from the early thirties.  He was the son of a samarai who made the transition to the Army.  Hirohito's rule was basically like the shogun ruled Japan.  The Generals had the veto power over all decisions of the government.  The Emperor participated very little in the decisions.  Tojo was the spokesman who ultimately pushed all contenders to the side.  In 1944, he was deposed himself. Hoyt tackles some serious issues in this book such as the mistreatment of prisoners of war(POWs) and European civilians, the war of conquest in China, and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity League.  This book may not be the leading authority on Tojo or what happened in military Japan, but it is a great summary of some difficult history.
