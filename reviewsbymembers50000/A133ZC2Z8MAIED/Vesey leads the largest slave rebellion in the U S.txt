 David Robinson attempts to define the life of Denmark Vessey.  Since Vessey is little known, and not much has been written about him, this short book attempts to define what motivated Denmark Vessey to try to lead on of the largest slave rebellions.  Good background material about Barbados and Charlestown's links with the slave island.  One of the previous reviewers called Vessey a Haitan, but his name indicates origin in the Danish Virgin Islands, as Robertson asserts.  Because his origin is so obscure, Robertson puffs up what is known and makes it book length.  More research could have led to a more interesting book.  However Robertson does shed light on an interesting time in U. S. History.
