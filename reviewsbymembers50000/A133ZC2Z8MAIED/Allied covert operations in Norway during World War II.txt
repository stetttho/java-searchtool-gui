 An interesting story of the operation of anti-Nazi forces in Norway during World War II.  Howarth was the Royal Navy officer responsible for coordinating activities with Norwegian fishermen during this time.  The stories represent the resistance Norwegians provided the Nazis and Quislings in Norway.  Howarth was not allowed to go to Norway because of the dangerous activites, but his account is first hand, so I discount the previous reviewers assertion that this book is not truthful enough.  From the previous reviewer's viewpoint, we can't trust any second or third party accounts.  Well, Howarth was there and interacted with these resistance fighters, so that is good enough for most readers. The Shetlands are a remote island group of the United Kingdom.  Howarth provides some details of the history of the region, and the geographic detail.  Then the stories of ferrying supplies and spies to German occupied Norway.  These stories are interesting, but not as interesting as the shoot ups I read about in some other Howarth books (We Die Alone, The Sledge Patrol, D-Day -June 6, 1944).  Howarth is a great author, and I have read eight of his books.  Anybody wanting to read good history should read his books.  It is a shame of his recent passing, because I will soon run out of books written by him.
