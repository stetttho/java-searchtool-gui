 The author Bryan Perrett seeks to give the reader ten unlikely victories which were against great odds.  Most of these victories are little heralded in modern history (with the possible exception of the commando raid on Normandy) and so present the reader with fresh perspectives on ten little known battles.  All of these are land battles, so those interested in naval history will have to look elsewhere.  Such battles described included the taking of the Taku Forts, the march into Palestine by the British, the relieving of Lucknow, a Hill fight in Vietnam.  All very relevant, but all little known. All these victories are relevant, but somehow I lost their relevant importance in the great scheme of history.  The author tries to impart this in some of the ten stories, but fails in others.  I consider this an average read in history.  There are other books out there that cover important battles better.
