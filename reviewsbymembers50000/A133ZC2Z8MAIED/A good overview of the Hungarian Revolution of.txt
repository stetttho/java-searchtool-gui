 Barber does a good job of covering the Hungarian uprising of 1956.  He covers events both inside the capital Budapest and the outlying countryside.  Also acknowledged is the internal power struggle between the various Communist factions prior to the uprising.  I found the explanation of the politics of Nagy, Gero, and Kadar good.  One thing not covered in detail was the Stalinist legacy left by Rakosi.  The book should have detailed both Rakosi and Horthy's legacy in Hungary, and why it led to the Revolution. Book was well written using both what Barber witnessed and other external sources.  Probably one of the better summaries of the Hungarian uprising.
