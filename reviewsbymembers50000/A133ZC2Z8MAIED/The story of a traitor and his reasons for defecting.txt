 I read this book out of an interest for why someone would throw a promising career away for ideological reasons.  Obviously this book was written after the Soviet Union fell apart, and Blake's reasons for defecting have been swept into the dustbin of history.  George Blake was born of a naturalized Englishman and a Dutch mother.  However, he turned against his adapted country because he believed in Communism.  This despite a harsh life in prison during the Korean War when his embassy was overrun by the North Koreans. Blake's reason for spying don't ring true.  He tells of taking photos of all documents that came his way.  This undoubtably led to the death of many agents in the East Bloc.  He says he had a agreement with the Soviets that nobody would be killed because of his unmasking of British agents in the Soviet Bloc.  Gimme a break.  Several British agents were killed because of his spying. Then he complains of his "harsh" sentence of 42 years,  Come on, a spy causes the death of several British spys, and then complains of his hard penalty.  If he was on the other side, the Soviets would have placed him in front of a firing squad.  Blake is just trying to justify his most reprehensible behavior in betraying a country that gave him everything.   This book gives a very personal history of a traitor.  This is an adequate read for someone interested in the spy wars of the Cold War.
