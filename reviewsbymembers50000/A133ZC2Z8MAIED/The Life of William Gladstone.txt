 This is the political life story of the Grand Old Man of British politics (GOM).  William E. Gladstone certainly did influence British politics for over fifty years, and was elected to the Prime Minister position four times.  This short book (or thesis) explained his political development through those fifty years.  He moved from a Conservative on social issues to that of a Liberal or even Radical position.  His championship of Irish Home Rule kept Ireland within the British Empire for thirty more years.  This man and his political position kept the radical left from many popular positions.  The unfortunate part of this book is that it reads like a thesis.  It probably was a thesis and as such will not attract much interest from the general public.  I did learn a great deal about this most influencial of British politicians.
