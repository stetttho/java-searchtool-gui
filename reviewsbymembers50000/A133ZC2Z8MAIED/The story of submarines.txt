 A nice story of the development of the submarine.  I didn't think there was much of a story here until I read the book.  This a nice concise summary of the history of submarines, complete with great illustrations and pictures.  The perspective is British throughout, since this is a BBC book.  It details the development of the submarine from the Revolutionary War to present times.  This book leaves out the exploits of the Hunley, the Confederate submarine which sank a Union frigate.  I found this kind of poor writing, since the Confederate submarine was one of the first to prove its ability as a military weapon.  Other than that, the author does a good job detailing the development of this military weapon.  The author also adds a chapter for the scientific and economic value submarines may hold for the future. If the reader is looking for a book detailing the development of the submarine, this is a great read.  It supports a major television documentary on submarines.  Good reading.
