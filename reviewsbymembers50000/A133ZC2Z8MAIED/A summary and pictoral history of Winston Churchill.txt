 The pictures are great and the summary history is OK for this nice little read about one of the great leaders of the 20th Century.  Humes met Churchill three times and knew many of his advisers, so who better to write a summary history of this great man.  Humes nicely portrays the man and his deep convictions.  Since this is a summary, there is not a lot of meat in this little book, but one can get an essence of this man by reading this book. This is a great picture book, and the writing is adequate about the subject.
