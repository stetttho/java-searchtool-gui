 Indeed the world did fail Rwanda as the author points out in the book about the genocide of the Tutsis in Rwanda.  First off, Egypt and France sell huge quantities of arms to a government in a civil war.  The French even send military advisers to train the Hutu Power militias.  This advisory team has the intials C.R.A.P., something easily indentifiable with the French.  The British and Americans downplay the fact that a genocide is about to occur and even urge no U.N. peacemakers be sent to the country.  Boutros Ghali-U.N. Secretary General and one of those who earlier sold weapons to the Rwandan Hutus downplays the possibility of large scale killings and genocide.  When the genocide does occur, they are in disbelief and don't react for two months while 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus are killed.  Finally when the bankrupt Hutu Power regime is in its last gasp, the French send humanitarian assistance to the Hutus.   As the author shows, there is plenty of blame to go around.  The Americans and British prevented help from being sent to prevent a genocide.  The French supported a genocidal regime, and in my opinion don't even deserve to be on the Security Council.  Hutu Power hopefully has been consigned to the dustbin of history.  The U.N. is a paper tiger with feckless authority.  The world did indeed turn its back on 800,000 Tutsis in Rwanda.  A good read about a tragic event.
