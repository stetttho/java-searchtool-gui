 This is a great adventure story by Edwin Hoyt.  I am glad this book is back in print.  This is the true story of the German light cruiser Emden and its adventures during the first part of World War I.  The Emden was based in the German colony of Tsingtao and was commanded by Von Muller.  This ship broke away from the main German Asiatic fleet and raided Allied shipping in the Indian Ocean.  It shelled the oil refinery in Madras, India and sailed into a Malayan harbor and sunk an Allied cruiser.  It caused so much havoc that the Allied authorities tied down valuable warships hunting for the Emden.  It was eventually caught and destroyed by the Australian heavy cruiser Sydney. The story does not stop there because fifty of the crew escape capture and take a sailing vessel and go to Arabia, and then eventually make their way home to Germany.  This was truly a great story. This is one of Hoyt's early works.  I always enjoy his books and recommend them to anybody who wants to both learn and enjoy a good read.
