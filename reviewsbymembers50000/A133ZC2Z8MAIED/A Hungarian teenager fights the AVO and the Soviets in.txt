 A quick read from a soldier of the Hungarian revolutionaries who overthrew the Russian backed Communist government in 1956.  Tamas talks about his personal experiences in the war, but does not really tell us why he fights.  He should have elaborated on his family's internal exile and the dislike of the Russians and their Hungarian stooges.  If you expect to understand the Hungarian Revolution, read elsewhere.  This is a good and quick read about the personal experiences of a soldier in the Hungarian Revolution.  Tamas was lucky to get out of Hungary alive after the Revolution stalled.
