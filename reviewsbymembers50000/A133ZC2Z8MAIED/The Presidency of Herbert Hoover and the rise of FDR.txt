 Herbert Hoover was probably the smartest and most able of the American Presidents (a distinction he shares with Clinton). His Presidency will go down as one of the worst.  Why?  The Great Depression hit the country soon after Hoover took office, and despite tremedous efforts by the President, extended throughout his term.  Smith details the rise of Hoover and his administration during these four years.  I think he is fair on how Hoover and his administration tried to cope with the Great Depression.  He also details the rise of FDR and gives both positive and negative stories about him.  For instance, Roosevelt failed to cooperate when he was President Elect with Hoover in trying to shore up the banking system when so many banks were failing.  Up to the moment he left office Hoover tried to serve the American people, while Roosevelt played politics and let huge banks fail. This is a good portrait of the Hoover Administration.  Smith details quite a bit about the Hoover Administration and the 1932 Presidential Election, but he is short on early material about Hoover.  Altogether a good read about a well meaning man and the Great Depression.
