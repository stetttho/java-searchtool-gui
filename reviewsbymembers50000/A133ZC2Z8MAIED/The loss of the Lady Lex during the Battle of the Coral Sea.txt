 America had only six carriers at the beginning of World War II.  The oldest was the Lexington, the second carrier in the U.S. Fleet after the Langley.  She was build on the frame of a battle cruiser, had a good crew headed by Sherman, and a good record.  During the Battle of the Coral Sea she was lost after sustaining multiple torpedo and bomb hits which exploded ordinance inside here.  The author details the history of this mighty ship and the last eight hours of her life. I like the insight the author put into this book.  He interviewed a good number of personnel from the Lexington before he wrote this account.  This shows the didication the personnel of the ship had towards saving her after her many hits.  It also shows the death of many while fighting the fires and then abandoning the ship.  It is a great story about a great ship.
