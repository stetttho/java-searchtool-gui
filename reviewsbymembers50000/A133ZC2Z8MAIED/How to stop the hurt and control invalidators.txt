 I picked this book up and read it in two hours.  When someone you know and love uses the principle of invalidating, it hurts.  Sometimes this hurt can destroy personal lives and careers, so it is important to control this behavior by the invalidator and somehow stop it.  Since this book is so relevant to me, I found the principles in this book GREAT.  I now know how to look for this behavior and somewhat how to respond to it.  I would be interested in a revised edition, since Jay Carter has left it up to the reader on a strategy to cope with invalidating.   This is a great book for those who suffer the effects of invalidating.  After experiencing invalidation, I sometimes find myself using it.  This book has helped me to put a stop to this behavior in myself and to try to use Carter's principles (especially mirroring) on that loved one who uses invalidating.
