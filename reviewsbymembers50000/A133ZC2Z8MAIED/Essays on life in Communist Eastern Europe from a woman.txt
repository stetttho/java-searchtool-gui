 I have read Drakulic's later book Balken Express, and thought this book far better.  Drakulic's book is a series of essays about the difficulty of life in Eastern Europe from a woman's perspective.  Communism collasped because it could not satisfy the demands of the population.  Drakulic details many of those shortcomings in her book.  Not only did Communism produce poor paint and bad toilet paper, it did not even produce tampons or other products for women.  That is why Communism failed.  Few history books will detail this perspective, but from a humanistic point of view, it is true. The other perspective Drakulic tries to point out is that of a journalist pointing to the failures of both Communist and Western society.  Drakulic portrays the homeless of NYC with the fact that in Communist society everybody is poor but not homeless.  These perspectives are needed as well, because some aspects of Communism were indeed noble.   A good book about the failure of Communism.  This book was a short informative read about a doomed political system.
