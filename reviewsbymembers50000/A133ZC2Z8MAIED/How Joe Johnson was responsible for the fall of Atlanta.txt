 Most people who follow the Civil War would say that Joe Johnson was a very capable general for the Confederacy.  In Davis's book, Johnson is shown as a general who was cautious and to a certain extent defeatist in his dealings with Sherman.  I think the author makes a good case that Johnson's conservative generalship led to the forordained loss of Atlanta, and that the three weeks of Hood's command was an attempt to change the fate of Atlanta.  Davis makes a good case by examining the records and correspondence of the loss of Atlanta.  Hood's later reckless assault against Unionist forces in Tennessee clouded his capable handling of the forces around Atlanta.  This is revisionist history, but I think the author makes a solid case that Johnson's defense was not good for a nation wanting an active defense of one of their largest cities.  Hood's offensive was much more appreciated by the military and civil authorities in Richmond and Atlanta.  Johnson's own conduct after the war plus the esteem his soldiers held him caused his redemption.  A nice little book about the defense of Atlanta.  Sherman would have won ultimately because of his numbers.  However the theory of Johnson's conservative strategy resulted in the fall of Atlanta.
