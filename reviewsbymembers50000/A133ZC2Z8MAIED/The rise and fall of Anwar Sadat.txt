 Haykal does a good job of detailing the rise and fall of Anwar Sadat.  For those in the know, when Sadat was assassinated, few of the populace mourned the passing of this great man.  He led the Arabs to victory, and he made a great gamble and went to Jerusalem to seek peace.  The peace dividend did not amount to much, and the Israelis used Sadat to some extent. Haykal who is a prominent journalist in Egypt details the conditions in Sadat's Egypt.  They were conditions which were similar to the Shah's Iran.  Both Christians and Muslims were very discontented.  The IMF wanted food subsidies to go down which caused rioting in the streets.  Parliament, journalists, and the bureaucrats were muzzled.  Haykal details this in the majority of the book. The last two sections of the book deal with the unrest and assasination of Sadat.  I was not in full agreement with what the author stated in the summary.  He detailed how Sadat gave in to an imperial Israel who was trying to dominate the region.  I felt like saying give me a break.  He stated that Israel was the main terrorist in the region.  Of course that would explain how Palestinians like to hijack aircraft and blow things up.  This is the typical poor Arab, bad Jew views expressed in most Arab areas.  It is not objective and does not hold up to the available evidence. Sadat was human.  He broke the mode by choosing peace rather than endless war.  He had democratic tendencies, but he was an authoritarian leader.  This book pointed out all Sadat's weaknesses but also gave this man credit for what he did.  Muslim fundamentalist terrorists killed this great man, but Haykal points out that if he was not killed, he might have been overthrown.  I have read Sadat's autobiography In Search of Identity, but reading this book gives a more balanced view of this great man.
