 I believe this to be a unique book about what is going to happen after Germany is conquered and Hitler gone.  Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States all had different thoughts about what needed to be done to Germany.  In the United States there were differences between the State Department and the Treasury Department about what would become of Germany.  The Treasury Department headed by Morgenthau was for a vindicative peace.  Morgenthau was Jewish and wanted Germany to be divided and an agrarian nation.  Hull wanted a generous peace where the U.S. would help the Germans reconstruct, and stay an industrial nation so she could rebuild Europe. I shudder to think if we had heeded Morgenthau on Germany.  The rest of Europe would have become Communist.  Fortunately, Morgenthau failed and Truman got him to resign.  This book details the policy battles between the State, Treasury, and War Departments about the fate of Germany. Beschloss does a good job detailing the policy battles between the departments and differences with the British and Soviets.  This book was very readable, and not difficult to go through.  I have some of Beschloss's other books, which I haven't read and this will spur me to read these.  This was a pretty good read, especially for a policy book.
