 Even though I gave this book only three stars, it is an interesting though tough read.  Simes is a Russian Jew who left the Soviet Union in 1973.  Since the late eighties, he has served the former late President Richard Nixon.  His trips during the late Soviet era and the first years of the Russian Federation show how U.S. policy has not been full of insight and purpose.  Rather he shows the errors of the Bush I and Clinton presidencies.  We supported the leader (Gorbachev and Yeltsin) rather than policies that would have helped Russia. Simes also tells us we support doctrinaire policies rather than ones helpful to the Russian people.  This is good information for our vaulted foreign policy, since Simes showed the West has made things worse rather than better.  He also criticizes democracy in Russia, when at best the government of Russia is a benign authoritarian government. What I dislike about this book is the name invoking nature of the author's writings. His obvious closeness to Nixon and his policies is one thing.  I think the author tries to place himself close to other top Russians.  This tends to get old after the first few chapters.  Also, the writings of an academic are hard on a normal reader.  As one of the previous reviewers has already noted, the chapters move from one topic to another and the reader gets confused following this.  Overall there is alot of good information in this book.
