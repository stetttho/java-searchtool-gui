 This is the story of the attack on our country on 9/11/01.  The story goes all the way back to the late 1980's and originates in Afghanistan.  Berstein does a good job of describing how bin Laden and his group of thugs got their grounding in the basics of terrorism.  Not only bin Laden but some of the other members (Atta) are described in their early life. Along with the story of the terrorists, there are stories of some of the victims of 09/11/01.  Bernstein does a good job in describing their lives, so we know what America lost in this attack.  Unlike other journalists, Berstein gives reasons why the FBI/CIA did not pick up on the attack.   This is a good summary of the attacks and the reasons they originated.  The title sums up the surprise Americans felt when the attack came.
