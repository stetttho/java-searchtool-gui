 I rarely watch television but I have made an exception for this wonderful series of PBS shows about the war in Vietnam.  This series ranks up there with Ken Burns Civil War and the BBC World at War.  This covers the war in Vietnam from all angles.  Not only is the French war included, but the interlude when North and South Vietnam were separated.  Of course, the concentration is where it should be--the American involvement in a difficult and costly war.  The one gripe I have is many of the GIs were from the Boston area (including John Kerry), and so one didn't get a snapshot of the entire country. One moment I remembered is when the story is recounted of Marines storming into a South Vietnamese villiage.  At least one and possibly more villagers were shooting at the Marines and killed some.  When the Marines entered into the village, they tossed grenades into occupied houses, and shot villiagers.  From the Vietnamese perspective, the villagers were just innocents going about their everyday existence, and no one mentions the armed villagers killing Marines.  From the Marines perspective, somebody killed their friends and someone was gong to pay.  This demonstrates the fog of war. I was young when this war was going on, but even now it is a controversial subject to discuss with anybody.  I really did disagree with some of those being interviewed, and can see why the Vietnam War is still difficult to discuss today.  However if one sees the DVD, one has a better idea of the subject and why it was such a hot topic.   After seeing this DVD and reading Karnow's book, I now better understand the Vietnam War.  This is truly a must see, for those wanting to better understand why the United States got itself into such a difficult war.  Highly recommended.
