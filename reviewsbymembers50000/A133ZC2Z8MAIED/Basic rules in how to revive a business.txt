 If you have been to business school, most of these pointers have been learned.  Still books like this are a refreshing read on how to revive a business.  Frank has ten pointers to learn, but most businessmen already know these.  I can summarize some:  work hard, start early, work as a team, recognize employees who perform, and before you leave for the day, make one final effort. This is not brain surgery, but it is amazing the number of businesses that fail in even this. If I had any critique of these principles, it it the author focusing on the sales side.  These principles can be applied to any business.  A simple, refreshing read.
