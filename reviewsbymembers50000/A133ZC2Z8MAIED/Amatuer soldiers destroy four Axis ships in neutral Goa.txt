 As a previous reviewer has also stated, I was introduced to this book by the movie Sea Wolves.  The book is better than the movie.  The movie starred David Niven and Roger Moore, and the producers gave Roger a woman to pursue in romance.  The reality of the situation was three German and one Italian ship were interned in Portuguese Goa for the duration of the war.  The largest and newest of the German ships had a radio transmitter sending signals to several U-Boats in the Indian Ocean.  These U-Boats sank thousands of tons of Allied shipping due to the Germans breaking the neutrality of Goa.  Some amatuer middle aged British businessmen set out to capture these vessels under the guidance of British authorities.  When they board one vessel, the crews of all four think they are about to be captured and scuttle their own ships.  The radio transmitter is silenced and the U-Boats are left to find their own victims. The book reads like a novel, which it isn't.  It is a great read for someone interested in some of the lesser sideshows of World War II.
