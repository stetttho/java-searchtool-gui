 This is an interesting read.  Morris describes how the new political system works.  Since he and his best bud Bill Clinton upset the political formula in the nineties, this was something to behold. This book is chock full of good advice.  I can repeat them here:  have a message, focus that message to the voters, forget about the undecided-they don't vote anyway, stay positive, when the election turns dirty, focus on your opponents misrepresentations, etc.  I don't think Morris actually followed this advice, but hey, what do you expect from a politician.   I think this is sage advice.  The messenger was bad.  Americans don't like dirty campaigns.  They want the message of what a person stands for.  This is a book about how a good campaign should be run.  For those considering running for an elective office, this is a very good read.  It is Politics 101.  I just wish the author was different.
