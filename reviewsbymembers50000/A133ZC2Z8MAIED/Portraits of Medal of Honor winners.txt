 Short biographies of 10 men and 1 woman who won this famous award and the lives they lived.  Mikaelian selected only people who lived through their ordeal, and then reviewed their life stories after their heroic actions.  For the most part, these men went back to living undistinguished lives.  The author also details other MOH winners, along with these 11 individuals. The best story is about a Medal of Honor winner in the Eighth Air Force during WWII.  Snuffy was an interesting character to say the list.  His advocacy of a medicinal cream called Firmo was a real laugh.   This was an OK read, and I got some insight into the military award process.  I am not sure why Mike Wallace needed to contribute anything to this book.  I guess the Publishers wanted a high name person attached to this book to boost sales.  Wallace's contribution was little, and his writing should not have appeared in the book.
