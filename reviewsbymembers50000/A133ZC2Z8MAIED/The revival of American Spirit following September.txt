 Life magazine always produces great pictures and this is no exception in this book.  The book is a compilation of the life of America following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  The personal stories are always the best to read about.  There is a personal background of five people who survived the attacks and this is very poignant.  One detailed a young widow of a NYFD person killed in the attack.  She described the payout which she recieved as a victim as our "sad money".  These people will never be the same as a result of the attack. I find fault with this book because there is so little focus.  It descibes personal stories, then goes off to talk about the ex mayor, then looks at Afghanistan.  There is a series of writings in here about the American spirit, but there is no focus in even this.  This is a hard book to follow, so I rated it low.  The editor should have focused on one trend.
