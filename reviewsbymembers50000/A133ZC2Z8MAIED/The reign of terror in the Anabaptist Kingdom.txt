 This is a good, original story of radicals in the Reformation movement taking a town over and transforming it into a theocracy. Munster had a uneasy alliance of Catholics and Lutherians who tolerated each other.  The radical Anabaptists took over the town and forced Catholics and moderate elements to leave the city.  The Prince Bishop which ruled Munster opposed them.  Two Jans  transformed the city into a Nazi like state.  I agree with the review that the final chapter was a stretch in how it related to modern movements.  Arthur wanted to say that history repeats itself.  The final chapter could have been cut down.  Also in the beginning, more focus could have been given the Anabaptist beliefs.  A good short read.
