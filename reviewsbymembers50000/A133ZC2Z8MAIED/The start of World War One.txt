 First off, let me say that Fromkin's A Peace to End All Peace is one of the best books about why there are still problems in the Middle East.  It should top anybody's list of great historical works.  I really enjoyed it.  I was expecting the same with this work, but unfortunately this book comes up short.  Fromkin's thesis is that there were two wars comprising World War One.  The first one dealt with Serbia and Austria and the second one dealt with Germany versus Russia and France.  It generally paints the Serbs and Russians as peaceful people with just a few bad apples among them.  The Germans are depicted as warmongers and military supremecists.  I am not sure I agree with this depiction.  The Serbs were engaged in some very disturbing activities not just in Bosnia but elsewhere.  Half the Serb population wanted to dissolve Austria-Hungary and pick up pieces to reconstiture a great Serb Empire.  Russia wanted to support its ally in the Balkans after its ruin in the Russian-Japanese War.  Both these nations were not babes in the wood looking for a peaceful solution.  They actively participated in starting the war and that is why I can't accept Fromkin's thesis. I was interested in the politics of the blank check.  It does add color to what is generally understood about the treaty situation in WWI.  Germany needed to back Austria, even though Austria would never back Germany in a similar crisis.  I think that part is believable.  This book gives an interesting theory, but it is the same samo.  Blame the Germans and Austrians because they started it.
