 Melby was a worker in the American Embassy in China during the three year Chinese Civil War.  He gives his perspective along with interesting stories about who lost China.  Who lost China? Well, the Generalissimo and the Kuomintang lost China.  Marshall and the U.S. Ambassador Dr. Stuart tried to get the Nationalists and Communists to form a coalition government, but instead both sides were hell bent on trying to beat the other by military means.  One senses a disgust by Melby for the corrupt Nationalist government and a certain trust in the Communists.  However history will prove him wrong because of the subsequent millions of deaths caused by Mao and his henchmen.  The Kuomintang were certainly corrupt and stupid, but history will record them as less brutal than the Communists. This is a hard book to read.  The reader has to have a certain knowledge of Chinese events and persons in order to understand this narrative.  However one will understand why no Americans lost China, it was the Nationalists who defeated themselves.  Chiang Kai Shek does not come off as a trustworthy person, and he ultimately deserves the responsibility for losing his country to the Communists.
