 Aker has a nice book about the military history of the Yom Kipper War.  The perspective details why the war happened, what took place during the war, and the aftermath in a consise 135 pages with references.  Since the war lasted only 18 days, I found this book about right in how to detail this war. This book was written in 1985, so detailed sources from the Soviet archives were not available at the time.  It also details the war more from an Israeli perspective rather that an Arab one, so it is slightly biased.  Also, at times it was rather dry.  However Aker does a brillant job of boiling down the war to the main points and the big picture.  If one wants to know more about this war, then this is a good book to start with.
