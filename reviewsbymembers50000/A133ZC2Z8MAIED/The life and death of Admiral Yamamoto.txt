 Hoyt does a alright job detailing the life of Admiral Yamamoto. I felt the book dragged at points, but the author does a satisfactory job detailing the life of the person who planned the Pearl Harbor attack.  Hoyt kept strictly to the professional life of the Admiral, and only made passing references to the Admiral's family, passion for geishas, and gambling.  I think you don't get the full story of Yamamoto's success, unless you delve into the personal life. Hoyt doesn't do this, he strictly keeps to the military aspect of the Admiral's life, like his biography of Tojo.  I think you miss something here. Another aspect missing from the Admiral's life in his killing by American flyers.  The killing is briefly detailed in a chapter, so again an interesting aspect of Yamamoto's life is left out. As I stated, the book could have been more interesting if it included more on his life, rather than the focus on the military aspect.
