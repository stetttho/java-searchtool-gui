 A great little story of how two Norwegian-Americans rowed from New York City to Great Britain and France.  I think this story is of interest, but is not as well written as The Perfect Storm  or The Terrrible Hours.  Still the story shows the terrible storms in the Atlantic and the difficulties in baring the elements in the ocean.  They even come across a sea monster, and several Norwegian ships.  I don't believe the sea monster stuff. Once back in New York, there anticipated payback was not to be.  Very few people paid to see their exhibits in either Europe and America.  The success of the crossing did not lead to happy lives.
