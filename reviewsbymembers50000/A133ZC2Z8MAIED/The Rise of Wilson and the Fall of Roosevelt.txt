 Chace does a good job of detailing why the election of 1912 was so important to the United States.  He describes the four participants in the election of 1912: Wilson, Taft, Roosevelt, and Debs.  Bryan was also a factor in the Democratic nomination of Wilson.  The main focus of this book is how these leaders would affect change in America.  Taft was the conservative and Debs was the radical.  Roosevelt and Wilson were the candidates for the Progressive faction of the country.  Chace describes each candidate and all his positives and negatives.  I didn't know Wilson was such a reactionary on race and immigrant relations, while Roosevelt was generally very liberal on these issues.  All in all a good book about the campaign and why the Republican Party veered to the right. For those interested in the politics of America, this is a good read.  The reader would be surprised to find that the red and blue states have actually changed over the years.  In the past, the South was reactionary and the West was Progressive while the East and Midwest favored the conservative (Republican) issues. Not so today.  Hats off to Chace for writing a good read.
