 I give credit to Dick Morris for trying to gauge the future effects of the Internet on politics.  I believe many of the things he proposes will come true, except that it may take extra time for the Internet to have the effect.  Many people are still not hooked up to the Internet, and so what he says may happen could take 20 years.  Still, the Internet will have a dramatic effect on politics.  One thing I disagree on is that political parties will die on the vine.  Somehow, parties will cling to power and influence the public as they have for hundreds of years. This is an interesting read with some very valid points.  I give the author credit for writing about something unique.
