 Davies is a fine historian of Poland and he is at best in describing about this little known war.  Few people know that Poland invaded the Ukraine in 1919 or that Russia invaded Poland in 1920.  Davies describes these see saw battles in this book and how it affected the rest of Europe.  Despite what one reviewer descibed at the saving of Western civilization by Poland, Davies is prettly harsh with his evaluations of the participants in the war.  Lloyd George was fickle in his lack of support of the Polish.  The French were spineless (and still are) in their support of the Polish when the Russians invaded.  Lenin swayed back and forth between building socialism in one country, or causing revolution worldwide.  Pilsudski was a military dictator.  The Germans were disinterested. This is a nice read on a little known war.  Few people know that the Russian Revolution might have been crushed if the Russians had defeated the Polish and invaded Germany.  If this had happened the French and British would have had to stop the Red Menace for good and destroyed the Bolshevik Revolution.  This is a good read for those interested in the aftermath of the First World War.
