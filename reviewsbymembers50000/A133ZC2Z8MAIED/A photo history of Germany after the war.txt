 There is very little writing in this book, so it is a photo history.  The book is in three languages, so two other translations appear along with the English.  Some of these are very touching photos, two dead Germans who appear to be soldiers but are in fact women who fought.  Another picture of a dead soldier with a Christmas card from his family opened up.  Most of the photos are those of the aftermath of the war when soldiers occupy Germany.  These show the devastation of war, and the effects on the population. I rate this as an average read, but in fact there is little to read.  The pictures are great, but it would have been nice to see Vacarro's perspective along with these photos.  The reader (?) is left to make his/her own judgement on what they are seeing.
