 This book reports to be like "A Night to Remember".  I disagree. Lord did a wonderful review of the Titantic Diaster.  The authors modeled their book on Lord's with the WTC twin towers as the disaster.  This book falls far short of Lord's book.  Perhaps the authors tried to include too many people in their writings.  I had problems with what people escaped and who didn't.  For instance, there was one man stuck in the elevator in the lobby, but the book never stated whether this man ever made it out alive.  There are many instances of this in this book. That said, this book sheds some light on why people fell from the top of the towers (many were pushed by others trying to get air) and why so many rescuers died (19th floor North Tower). There were some nice illustrations of what the two planes did in damage to both towers.  Nice stories about the PANYNJ construction guy going from room to room freeing people, and ultimately losing his own life.  Another story about the friend who would not leave his handicapped buddy in the building.  These stories will make a strong impact on any reader.   This is a good read, but not the best one on the market.  It sheds valuable light on those victims who resided in the buildings on the day of the attack.
