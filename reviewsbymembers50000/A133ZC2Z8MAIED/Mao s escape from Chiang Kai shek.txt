 A simplistic book about the 8,000 mile march by Mao and the Communists to escape the clutches of Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists.  This book was written for young people, but the book is too simplistic.  If you read the book, you would believe that Mao was a hero, rather than a bloody dictator.  I hope those who read this book also read something about the crimes Mao committed in the course of his career. This book is not critical enough of Mao.  Edmonds seems charmed by Mao.  I hope readers are not.
