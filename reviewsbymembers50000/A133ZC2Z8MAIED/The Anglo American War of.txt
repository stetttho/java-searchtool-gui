 I think the previous reviewer hit it on the head in regards to this book.  It accurately details the history and nature of this war, but it is so dry and fact based, that it was a difficult read.  This book of 10 chapters and 250 pages is chock full of info, but it does not convey any good reader interest.  It is hardly a page turner.  I have read some books twice the size of this book in half the time.  Other criticisms of this book is that it details the movement of troops and sometimes one cannot figure out whether the author is talking about the British or Americans.  In one instance, it talks of a tactical retreat by the British to Burlington, Vermont when the author meant to say Burlington, Ontario.  That confused this reader. If one whats information on this important war, one should look elsewhere.  This book is full of info, it just not interest the regular lay reader.  Look elsewhere for a better book.
