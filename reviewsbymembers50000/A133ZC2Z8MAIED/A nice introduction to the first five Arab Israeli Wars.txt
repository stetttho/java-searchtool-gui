 This is a surprisely good read on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  At only 180 odd pages, many studded with great pictures, there is a lot of history packed into this tight book.  The writing is really clear, so the reader is able to understand what was at stake in each of these conflicts.  The only unfortunate part of this book is the pro-Israeli slant of some of the writing.  Clearly this book sides with the Israelis when it comes down to the portrait of this conflict.  However, I think the author went out of his way to make sure he was fair.  Another aspect that I liked is the description of the equipment and the geo politics taking place in these conflicts.  Again the material was clearly laid out and the reader could draw his conclusions. This is a nice little introductory read on a conflict which still plagues our world.  Barker details the history of this conflict.  Since this was written in 1980, it is rather dated, and as already stated--somewhat pro Israeli.
