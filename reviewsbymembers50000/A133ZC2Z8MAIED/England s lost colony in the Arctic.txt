 This is an OK read about the Arctic.  There are actually two stories here.  The first revolves around English explorer and pirate  Martin Forbisher and the second about an American Charles Francis Hall.  Forbisher was searching for the northwest passage to China and found what he thought was a passage way and a black stone.  Assayers felt the stone could yield a fortune in gold.  The passage Forbisher found was a bay and the stone contained little in the way of precious metals.  Hall searched for the survivors of an earlier Artic expedition of Franklin.  He was disappointed too.  What he found were the traces of Forbisher's expedition.  Both explorers searched for something that was not there. The book is of interest to those historians who like the explorations of the Arctic and Antarctic.  What is facinating is the life of the Inuit or native peoples who inhabit this inhospital land.  It was interesting to read of how these people adapted to their environment.  The white man may have thought them savages. They were far more civilized than the white man.  As stated an OK read about a little known expedition.
