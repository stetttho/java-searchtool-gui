 This is a nice book of soldiers/sailors recollection of D-Day.  The book explains the outlook of a sample of soldiers for each of the 5 D-Day beaches and reviews the obstacles which they had to overcome.  Along with the written book, you get two fine CDs of the various soldiers relating their experiences on this famous day.  The oral history along with the summary of the battles gives an in depth picture of what these men had to face on this day.  In my viewpoint, all these men were heroes because of what they had to do.   There are other books out there that portray the battle day with more detail (The Longest Day) and some who relate experiences better (most of Ambrose's books).  This is an above average book and the CDs are great material.  The book and CDs are great, but there are better books on this subject.  This book will not disappoint.
