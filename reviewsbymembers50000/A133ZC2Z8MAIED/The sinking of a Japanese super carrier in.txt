 I disgree with some of the previous reviewers.  This is a great read for adventure and it is true.  It competes well with fictional Tom Clancy novels.  A small U.S. submarine under an unlucky Captain sinks the largest ship in the Japanese Navy. Shinano was the sister ship to the battleship Yamato (A Glorious Way to Die) and converted into a carrier, the size of one of our nuclear carriers today.  The Japanese intended to confront the U.S. Navy with the tremendous firepower of the Shinano.  Instead a lowly submarine sinks the Shinano on her maiden voyage.   Regardless of whether the submarine captain Enright or Ryan wrote the story, it is great adventure.  Enright is certainly frank in his views, even about his own shortcomings.  Both the Japanese and American sides are presented here and this makes it good reading.  One understands the fog of battle, after reading about the pursuit of the carrier.  A good quick read which is not fiction.
