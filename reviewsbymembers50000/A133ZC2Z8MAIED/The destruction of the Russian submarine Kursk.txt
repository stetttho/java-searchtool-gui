 A great book about a sad disaster.  The Kursk was the pride of the Russian attack submarine fleet and one of the newest ships in the Navy.  On an exercise in the Arctic Ocean, the submarine blew up and sank.  Twenty six people survived the blast but died on the bottom of the ocean because the Russian Navy did not have adequate rescue facilities or did not want ask foreign governments for help.  This was truly needless death. Moore does a good job of detailing the death of this submarine and the decline of the Russian Navy.  Although the book is great to read, it does start off slowly, and the circumstances of the explosion is still in doubt.  Some say the warheads of one of the torpedoes went off, while Moore states categorically that it was the fuel of the torpedo which caused a flash fire and set the other warheads off.  The reason for the submarine exploding is still in doubt, but the aftermath is all too real in the suffering of the families of the crew members.   I have read another book about this subject--Kursk Down, but this is a superior read.
