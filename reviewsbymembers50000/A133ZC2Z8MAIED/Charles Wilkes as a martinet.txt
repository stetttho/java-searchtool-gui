 Everybody has heard about the Lewis and Clark Expedition.  Few have heard of the U.S. Expeditionary Exploration of the Pacific Ocean and Antartic.  I commend the author writing about the little known expedition that lead to the Smithsonian Institution.  I did know of Wilkes being the captain who authorized the seizing of the two Confederate dipolmats.  This book fills in the period when the United States was coming off the War of 1812 and before the Civil War.  During this time, the United States wanted to make its mark on the world by sending out an expedition which would survey the coasts of the western territories as well as chart the Pacific islands.   The author describes the formation of this expedition of ships and the travels.  The prime focus is the commander of this expedition who was smart and driven, but obviously not a leader of men.  Leaders make people want to go where they don't want to go.  Wilkes was one of those people who just forced people to do what he wanted by blunt force.  This driven man had few leadership skills and alienated most of those who served under him.  This is a good example of how not to lead. This book got off to a slow start, so that is why I rated it only a four star.  This is a good story and a book well worth reading.
