 I think the author brings up some very good information about the poor treatment of German POWs by the French and Americans at the end of WWII.  Not only did the Americans lower the calorie intake of German POWs but after the end of the war classified these prisoners under different status therefore depriving these men of all food.  Then to make matters worse, they turned these prisoners over to the French for slave labor.  The French camps were no better and the result was many deaths.  Not all German forces were subjected to this, only those captured at the end on the Western Front. After doing a good job of describing the motives and way of the Americans and French, the author then describes a vast conspiracy to starve and then cover up the deaths of a million German POWs.  He faults the higher ups in the American military and DeGalle for doing this.  I found his discussion on the arithmetic to be confusing, but he sounds dead serious in his feelings that at least a million died.  After I read his analysis, I came away with the feeling that starvation and deaths did occur, but not a million men.  It sounded to me more like the U.S. Army did not know how many men they had captured. However, the author justs keep pounding away on this vast conspiracy.  Jim, if there were a million dead, where are all the bodies.  Where are all the grieving relatives?  Come on, be realistic, there may have been thousands starved, but a million men.  His arguments and justification did not convince this reader.  He merely confused me with his math. I think this book serves a purpose.  It shows the U.S. military can also be cruel and kill people.  The theory of a vast conspiracy is hard to stomach.  The author is a Canadian and vented his dislike of the U.S. and French governments.  The vast conspiracy portion of the book just showed the venom of the author.  This was not objective analysis of what happened.  He actually equated Eisenhower with Hitler.  What a comparison!
