 With the craze for Ali nowadays, this books points a different perspective on the blood feud between Ali and Frazier.  Ali said some pretty mean things about Smokin Joe, but most were untrue. Frazier comes across as the more admireable of the two fighters, and the one that perhaps Black America should look to as an inspiration.  Ali comes up far short. Frazier came from poor black folks in South Carolina, while Ali had some Irish blood and was raised in a middle class suburb of Nashville.  Frazier worked his way up from the working class, while Ali had a silver spoon placed in his mouth.  Frazier was a law abiding citizen, but Ali evaded the draft laws.  Frazier was near blind in one eye, but continued to fight.  Ali complained when his trainers threw real punches.  Who is the inspiration here.  I say Frazier and not Ali.  Not withstanding Ali's mouth, perhaps more people will give Joe Frazier his rewards. Thanks to Mark Kram for bringing this story to light.
