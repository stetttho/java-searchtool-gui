 A nicely written book about the great Chicago Fire of October, 1871.  This book has some nice illustrations and photographs, along with some human interest stories concerning the fire.  The story is compelling in how it relates the burning of this city.  Only 200-300 people died as a result of this disaster.  The author relates how the fire occurred in Mrs. O'Leary's barn.  With some early mistakes with personnel in the fire detection system, a small fire became large because of the tardy arrival of firefighters and the brisk wind.  Since the city was mostly wood, the fire blew embers over the firefighters and lighted neighborhoods beyond the fire.  The firefighters had fought a fierce fire the night before, and most were very tired as they started to fight this fire.  The result was a burned area one mile wide by four miles deep.  Most of the business district was burned out. This is a nice read for those with only a vague notion of the fire.  Since I live in the suburbs of Chicago, it was with interest when I read the streets where the fire occurred.  The book also has some nice photographs and illustrations.
