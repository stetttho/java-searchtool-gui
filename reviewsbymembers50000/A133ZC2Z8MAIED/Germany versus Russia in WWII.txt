 The main contention of Rees is that there was little difference between Stalin and Hitler.  He is at least partially right.  I believe Stalin was more irrational and murderous than Hilter, and the numbers support Stalin as being worse than Hitler.  Mao was the worst.  Anyway Rees contention is that Hitler waged war against the rest of the world while Stalin waged war against his own countrymen.  The result was millions killed and rivers of blood.  Along with this review of the two dictators, is the war that was waged on the Eastern Front for close to four years.  It was waged against soldiers and civilians on both sides.  The review has a good summary of the war with many great pictures.   This is a good summary history and picture book.  For those who are looking at a review of the war on the Eastern Front, this is a nice starting point.
