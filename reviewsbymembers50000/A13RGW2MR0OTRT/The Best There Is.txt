 Best plunge router on the planet.  Best plunging smoothness by far, best collet system and best construction.  Noticed in one of the other reviews that the author thought that DeWalt made the Elu routers.  The reverse is  true. This router and the DW615 and DW621 are in fact made in Switzerland  by Elu which is now a division of Black and Decker. The only minor  complaint I have is that the router does not project the bit far enough  forward in the maximum plunge position which is a factor in router table  use. The Hitachi TR12 and M12V are superior in this regard and much  cheaper, but they don't have the smoothness of plunge and exquisite quality  of the DW625. For freehand use it's unbeatable, for router table use the  M12V is a better bargain and might be just as useable.
