 Without a doubt this is the best router value on the market. I state this owning 24 routers and I have at least one of nearly every model available. For the price of a PC 690 you get an extremely powerful PLUNGE router with the best balance of any plunger. It is not an accident that nearly every time you see someone in Fine Woodworking cutting a mortise with a plunge router they're are doing it using the TR12. It doesn't have variable speed or a soft start feature which would be nice but unless your doing raised panels the lack of variable speed is inconsequential. This is the best balanced hand held plunge router at the best price in the world.
