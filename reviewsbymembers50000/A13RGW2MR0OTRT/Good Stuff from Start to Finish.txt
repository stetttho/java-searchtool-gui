 When I think of totally solid albums I have to start with Who's Next by the Who and Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd. What made these albums so outstanding was that they had great music from  the first cut to the last: a monumental rarity. Vertical Horizon has  accomplished this Everest like feat with Everything You Want. All too many  times we buy albums for one to two good songs and the rest is filler. Not  here. Yes they do sound somewhat like REM. I consider that high praise.  Another Automatic for the People isn't such a bad thing is it?
