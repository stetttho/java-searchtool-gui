 At face value this seems to be a very nice router but, upon closer inspection, the design has serious flaws.  First the base seems to be too thin of a casting as you can feel it bend if you put side pressure on it.   Base stiffness is critical for precise plunging. This unwanted flexibility  may be due to the dust extraction tunnels cast into the base.  Secondly the  plunge is not nearly as smooth or precise as the DeWalt 621 as there is a  lot of slop between the rods and their linear bearings. Third the plunge  lock works opposite to the way that it should.  Plunge locks should be  normally off and applied to lock.  This, as with all PC plunge routers, is  normally on and worked to release.  This is much harder to use when  mortising than the lock down method used on the DeWalt 625 and on Hitachi's  and Makita's large plungers. A minor point is that the plastic chip shield  is a joke as it falls off easily.  On both the DW621 and this PC turning  the router on and off requires a finger dance with the PC's being slightly  easier.  What's wrong with a simple trigger switch without all of the  clusmy, and in my opinion vastly more unsafe, so called safety switches?  Spindle locks are not a feature as is claimed as when the collet releases  you have a good chance of damaging the rods.  PC did a nice job of giving  you the option of using two wrenches which is a better way to chuck and  unchuck the bit without damaging the rods. Nice handles which is a plus.  This could have been a great router like the DeWalt 625. Instead it's  simply an acceptable one.
