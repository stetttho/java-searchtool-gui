 This is an excellent guide to producing high-end wood finishes. In particular, the section on dye staining, a method often used by pros and underutilized by amateurs is outstanding.  This book ranks with  Understanding Wood Finishes by Bob Flexner as the two premier treatises on  the subject. Flexner focuses on the materials and Jewitt on the  application. The example finishing schedules provided at the end of the  book easily justify its price. Highly recommended.
