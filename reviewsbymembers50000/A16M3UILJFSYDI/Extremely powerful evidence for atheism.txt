 If there is a God, why is his existence not more obvious?  The traditional answer is that God is hidden.  However, as John L. Schellenberg (DPhil, Oxon) points out, an all-good or perfectly loving God would not remain  hidden.  Therefore, he argues, the fact that it is *reasonable* to not  believe in God is *evidence* for the non-existence of God.   What makes  Schellenberg's book so interesting is that Schellenberg was forced to  embrace atheism as a result of his own argument, despite the fact that  Schellenberg has said that he finds atheism quite unpalatable.  In the  conclusion of his book, Schellenberg encourages theists to find a flaw in  his argument so that he can once again believe in God.   Schellenberg's  book has created quite a stir in the philosophy of religion.  Just over a  year ago, I attended a conference of the Society of Christian Philosophers;  one of the themes for that conference was the argument from divine  hiddenness.  Indeed, I was told that Daniel Howard-Snyder and Paul Moser  are editing a forthcoming analogy on the argument, in the spirit of  Howard-Snyder's highly successful anthology, THE EVIDENTIAL ARGUMENT FROM  EVIL.   If you are interested in arguments for and against the existence  of God--whether you are a theist, atheist, or somewhere in between--this is  one book you will want on your bookshelf.
