 The first edition of Rowe's introductory text, PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION, was one of my textbooks as an undergraduate.  Rowe's presentation of the issues is great for beginners.  I was also impressed by the balance in his treatment.  This was nowhere more evident than in his discussion of the problem of evil: although Rowe pioneered the influential 'evidential' form of the argument from evil for atheism, he carefully and fairly lays out the issues in the debate over that argument. I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in the phil. of religion.
