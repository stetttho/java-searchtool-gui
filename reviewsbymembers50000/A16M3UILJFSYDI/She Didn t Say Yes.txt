 The Columbina massacre was a horrible tragedy; I was shocked and outraged by news of the event. My heart goes out to everyone who suffered as a result of the incident, including the parents of Cassie Bernall.     Unfortunately, whatever truths may be found in SHE SAID YES, the story of  Cassie's martyrdom is false. Cassie was not asked at gunpoint if she  believed in God; the Columbine shooters were not targeting Christians in  any way. While I am perfectly willing to grant the authors the benefit of  the doubt, there is now no evidence whatsoever to support the claim that  Cassie was martyred for her beliefs; this book should either be revised or  pulled from publication.    And contrary to what many other reviewers  have written, this DOES matter: the story has been used to slander atheists  and agnostics. Many people who uncritically accept the tale of Cassie's  martyrdom assume that the killers did not believe in God and therefore  believe that everyone who does not believe in God must be like the  Columbine shooters. This is a slander against everyone who does not believe  in God; everyone who cares about the truth should not spread this type of  misinterpretation.
