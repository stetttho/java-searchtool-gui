 I first learned about this text when it was recommended to me by Quentin Smith (Professor of Philosophy, Western Michigan University). I am very grateful for the recommendation, for I have learned much from Professor Ellin's helpful introduction.  Here is the table of contents: Preface 1.  An Introduction to Moral Theory PART I: SUBSTANTIALLY CONCEPTUAL ISSUES 2.  Challenges to Ethics: Relativism 3.  Challenges to Ethics: Egoism 4.  The Foundations of Ethics 5.  Moral Facts PART II: SUBSTIANTIALLY NORMATIVE ISSUES 6.  Lying 7.  Good Character 8.  Utilitarianism 9.  Kant: Evil as Irrationality 10.  The Meaning of Life Glossary List of Abbreviations Index I found chapters 4 and 10 to be helpful discussions of topics that are sometimes, if not often, omitted from texts of this type. In chapter 4, Ellin discusses, among other things, the relationship between religion and ethics. In chapter 10, Ellin discusses the question of the meaning of life, including the implications of death, repetitive pointlessness, ultimate insignificance, absurdity for "big picture" meaning and also for morality. Along with Pojman's _Ethics: Discovering Right and Wrong_ (3rd. ed.), Ellin's text offers an excellent college-level introduction to ethics.
