 Readers familiar with ethical literature will notice that the title of Pojman's book is similar to that of the late J.L. Mackie's book on ethics, _Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong_. The differences in titles reflect the differences in opinion among the two authors: Mackie was a relativist while Pojman is an objectivist.  Despite Pojman's rejection of relativism, though, he does an admirable job of presenting both sides fairly.  He also writes in a clear and conversational way, making this introductory text accessible to everyone.  Finally, his book is comprehensive; it includes a discussion of egoism, self-interest, and altuism; the question, "Why should I be moral?"; religion and ethics; and metaethics.
