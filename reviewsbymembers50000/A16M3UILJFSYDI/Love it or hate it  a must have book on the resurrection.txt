 Written in 1994 while Professor Leudemann was still a Christian,  this book caused such a storm of protest in Germany that the  original publisher declined to publish a second impression.  But  the same honesty which made the book so controversial is also  what makes it so valuable.  Leudemann decided to write this book  because he was dissatisfied with so much of what he read, and  therefore the book is a comprehensive treatment of the resurrection. He systematically surveys all of the passages in the New Testament which pertain to the Resurrection, beginning with 1 Corinthians 15 and ending with the last chapter of John.  In each instance, Leudemann writes like a sober historian, carefully considering each passage from a redactional, traditional, and critical historical perspective.  Leudemann argues that the tomb stories are late--Jesus may have received a dishonorable burial--and likewise the appearance stories are largely legendary.  But *something* did happen.  Leudemann skillfully extracts as much information as possible about that something from Paul's often cryptic statements, in order to formulate his own hypothesis as to how Christianity began.   Whether one one agrees, disagrees, or suspends judgment about  Leudemann's hypothesis, all serious students of the Resurrection  narratives will want to be familiar with this important book.  My only complaint about the book is the lack of a bibliography  and detailed indices (e.g., NT verses, subject, author).
