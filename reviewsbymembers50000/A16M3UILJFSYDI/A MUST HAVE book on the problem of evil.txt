 Anyone interested in the debate over the evidential argument from evil simply must have this book. It includes two influential but distinct formulations of the argument--those by William Rowe and Paul  Draper--followed by a number of essays written in response to one another.   The list of authors who contributed to the anthology is impressive.   Besides Rowe and Draper, the book also contains essays by Richard  Swinburne, Alvin Plantinga, Richard Gale, Bruce Russell, Peter van Inwagen,  and Stephen Wykstra.   Like Cole Mitchell, I was also somewhat  disappointed by the demographics of the book (10 of the book's 16 articles  were theistic).  Despite this flaw, I was still so pleased with the book  that I rated it with 5 stars.  Any serious student of the problem of evil  will want their own copy of this book.
