 Anti-evolutionists have become increasingly sophisticated in their attacks on biology. Phillip Johnson argues that evolution presupposes metaphysical naturalism. Michael Behe argues that evolution cannot explain 'irreducibly  complex' structures. Distinguished biologist Kenneth Miller (Brown  University) refutes these and other misguided attacks on biological  evolution in a delightfully written, fast-paced defense of evolution.  Miller, a practicing Roman Catholic, also has a fascinating section on  evolution's implications for religious belief. Anyone interested in  evolution and 'scientific' creation will want to add this book to their  library.
