 Uta Ranke-Heinemann is living proof that a person can be a theist *and* a freethinker.  According to the back cover of the book, she "was the first woman in the world to hold a chair of Catholic theology (1970) and the first to lose it--because she questioned the virgin birth (1987)."  In PUTTING AWAY CHILDISH THINGS, Ranke-Heinemann systematically refutes many traditional teachings of the Christian church, and she does so in a very readable way.   Here is the table of contents: Foreword  Introduction  1.  Luke's Christmas Fairy Tale  2.  Matthew's Fairy Tale of Jesus' Childhood  3.  The Virgin Mother  4.  The Angels  5.  Jesus' Genealogies  6.  Miraculous Fairy Tales  7.  Good Friday  8.  The Fairy Tale of Judas the Traitor  9.  Easter  10.  The Ascension  11.  Pentecost  12.  The Fairy Tale of Acts  13.  Peter in Rome?  14.  The Apocrypha  15.  Forgeries and False Authors  16.  Hell  17.  Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls  18.  Redemption by Execution  Afterword  Index I agree with the first reviewer's assessment that liberal Christians and skeptics will love the book, while conservatives will hate it. I also agree that Ranke-Heinemann spent very little space actually discussing what "Jesus' real message actually was."  But I would add that she spent even less space discussing WHY we should have faith in Jesus, once we have stripped away so many of the traditional church doctrines as "fairly tales" (p. 296)?  To make an analogy, consider the life of the 'historical Abraham Lincoln.'  Once we strip away the mythology, there are still good, authentic ethical principles left over and I can subjectively find meaning in my life by applying those principles.  But I don't have faith 'in' Abraham Lincoln.  And I certainly don't pray to him!  It is unclear why we should view the Jesus of liberal Christianity any differently. But don't let this objection detract you from reading the book. On the contrary, I highly recommend it!
