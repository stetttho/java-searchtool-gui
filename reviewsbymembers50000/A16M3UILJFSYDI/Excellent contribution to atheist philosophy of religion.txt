 _Nonbelief and Evil_ is a fascinating, thorough, and (in my opinion)  persuasive presentation of two arguments for the non-existence of God:  nonbelief and evil. Drange presents his own unique formulation of the  Argument from Evil, along with rebuttals to virtually every theistic  defense against the argument from evil, including Alvin Plantinga's Free  Will Defense, John Hick's Soul-Making Theodicy, the Unknown Purpose  Defense, and much more. And the Argument from Nonbelief -- the argument  that the mere existence of nonbelievers constitutes evidence for the  non-existence of God -- is an original argument by Drange. I think the book  will serve as a major contribution to the philosophy of religion.  _Nonbelief and Evil_ also includes some interesting appendices on related  issues including  the argument from the Bible, the concept of an afterlife,  and the fine-tuning argument. I enthusiastically endorse Drange's book.
