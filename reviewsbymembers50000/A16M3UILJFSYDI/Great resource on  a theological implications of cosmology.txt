 According to Big Bang cosmology, the universe began to exist about fifteen billion years ago with an explosion called `the Big Bang'.  But was this explosion created by God, or did it occur without cause? In Part I, Christian philosopher William Lane Craig defends the theistic interpretation of Big Bang cosmology.  In Part II, atheist philosopher Quentin Smith defends the atheistic interpretation.  Part III contains Craig's and Smith's interpretations of Stephen Hawking's cosmology, and its implications for the existence of God. An excellent scholarly resource for anyone interested in the debate over Big Bang cosmology.  Readers unfamiliar with Big Bang Theory may wish to consult other works before reading this one.
