 In response to court rulings that the teaching of creationism in public school science classes is unconstitutional, creationists have tried to tone down the religious aspects of creationism. They have even given creationism  a new name: the so-called 'intelligent design' (ID) hypothesis. In TOWER OF  BABEL, Robert T. Pennock refutes ID'ers and shows that creationism still  has no business in a science classroom.  In particular, Pennock provides a  devastating refutation of the misguided arguments of Phillip Johnson, one  of the leaders of the ID movement.  Highly recommended.
