 Although this is not the only topic Smith addresses in the book, I really appreciate the work he did on atheistic moral realism.  Smith reviews all of the relevant literature--including that by J.L. Mackie, Robert Adams,  and David O. Brink--and demonstrates the inherent plausibility of an  atheistic moral realism.   Smith also has occasion to defend a logical  argument from evil.  While I am skeptical of such arguments, Smith's book  should serve as a reminder to theists who wish to proclaim the death of  logical arguments from evil.     If you've ever wondered how an objective  morality could exist if God does not, and you've wanted a really thorough  treatment of the issue, this book is for you. Although Smith's book can be  difficult reading (especially for nonphilosophers), it is well worth the  effort.
