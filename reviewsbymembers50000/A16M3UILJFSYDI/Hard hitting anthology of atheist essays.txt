 _Critiques of God_ is a hard-hitting, comprehensive anthology of essays by leading atheist philosophers.  My only complaint is that Prometheus Books should have updated this book to reflect recent developments in the philosophy of religion since the book's original publication in 1976 (e.g., the kalam cosmological argument, the fine-tuning argument, the evidential argument from evil, etc.).
