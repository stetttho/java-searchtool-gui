 I once took a tour of Prometheus Books in Buffalo, NY in which I was told that George Smith's ATHEISM: THE CASE AGAINST GOD is one of their most popular selections.  Having read the book, it's easy to see why.  Smith's  book is an excellent introduction to nontheism.     My only criticism of  the book is that it is somewhat outdated.  Since Smith originally wrote the  book, theists have developed sophisticated new versions of the old  arguments for the existence of God (e.g., the kalam cosmological argument,  the fine-tuning argument, etc.).  While some of what Smith writes is  applicable to these 'new' arguments, the book was not written with these  arguments in mind and therefore does not directly clash with them.  I think  it would be great if Smith were to revise his book to reflect these recent  developments; it would not take much work at all to once again make  ATHEISM: THE CASE AGAINST GOD a state-of-the-art critique of reasons for  believing that God exists.
