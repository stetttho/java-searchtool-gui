 Sagi and Statman distinguish and discuss three different approaches to the relationship between religion and morality: (1) the strong dependence of morality on religion, (2) the weak dependence of morality on religion, and  (3) conflict between religion and morality.  This book is an excellent,  balanced, and refreshing contribution to the ongoing conversation about the  relationship between religion and morality.  I highly recommend it.
