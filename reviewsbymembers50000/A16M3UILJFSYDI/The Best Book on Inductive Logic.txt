 This is book is the best book on inductive logic I have seen. It's unfortunate, therefore, that it has gone out of print. Salmon describes the many different types of inductive arguments, including induction by enumeration, statistical syllogism, analogy, and the hypothetico-deductive method. He also provides a good introduction to inductive fallacies, including insufficient statistics, biased statistics, the fallacy of incomplete evidence, misuses of the argument from authority, and causal fallacies. If you read only one book on inductive logic, read this book!
