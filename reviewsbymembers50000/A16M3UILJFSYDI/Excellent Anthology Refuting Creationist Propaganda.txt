 This book, along with Douglas Futuyma's SCIENCE ON TRIAL and Richard Dawkins' THE BLIND WATCHMAKER, was one of my first books on creationism and evolution.  Overall, I think the book is excellent; however, I found the  individual essays to be of varying quality.  In my opinion, Ken Miller's  essay, "Scientific Creationism versus Evolution: The Mislabeled  Debate," is probably the most useful essay in the entire volume.  Ken  Miller, a Catholic biologist, is arguably the  best pro-evolution debater  today.  (See his recent book, FINDING DARWIN'S GOD.)  Also of value were  Robert Root-Bernstein's essay on demarcation criteria for distinguishing  science from pseudoscience, both of Stephen Jay Gould's chapters, Isaac  Asimov's illuminating chapter on the "threat" of creationism, and  the text of Federal Judge William Overton's decision in the historic  Arkansas case.  However, other chapters were lass valuable.  In particular,  I think Roger Cuffey's bibliographic essay, "Paleontologic Evidence  and Organic Evolution," will be worthless to almost everyone except  specialists.  Similarly, I was also disapppointed by the contributions of  Sidney Fox and L. Beverly Halstead; I was left wishing they had each  written essays more accessible to laymen.  But despite these flaws I think  the book is an important one.  Creationists, evolutionists, and anyone else  interested in the creation/evolution controversy will want to be familiar  with this important book.
