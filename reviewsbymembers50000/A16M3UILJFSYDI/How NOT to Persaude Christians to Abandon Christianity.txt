 Douglas A. Rankin, a linguist and freethinker, has modified the King James Version of the Bible so that all the sex, scatology, violence, and so forth therein is stated in plain, unambiguous, and uncensored language. The book  also includes a system of well-drawn icons that mark for the reader those  portions of the text that involve the types of content Rankin wishes to  highlight (a snoozing moon for the boring parts, a urinating child for  scatology, a Dracula face for canibalism, a copulating heterosexual couple  for heterosexual sex passages, and so forth). Yet _Queen Jane's Version_ is  much more than a translation of the King James Version into contemporary  English.  The book is designed to be "an iconoclastic, biting, often  shocking satire that mocks religious hypocrisy and the gullibility of  hard-core believers."  According to Rankin, the purpose of such an  approach is to inspire people to live life for life rather than for death,  for reality rather than for mind-crippling myth."  Yet, given the  book's antagonistic approach, I think it is highly unlikely that the book  will accomplish anything besides alienating Christians. In marketing terms,  this book is a "high negative."
