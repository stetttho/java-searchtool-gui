 Kai Nielsen is well-known for his work in the field of ethics. WHY BE MORAL? is a collection of some of Nielsen's most influential and useful essays on the basis or grounding of morality itself.  One word of caution, though: contrary to what the back cover says, this book is not written in a "nontechnical style." Nielsen uses A LOT of philosophical jargon; this book is probably inaccessible by anyone who has not completed a college-level course on ethics.
