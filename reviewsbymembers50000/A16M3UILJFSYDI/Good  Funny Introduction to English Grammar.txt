 This book was recommended to me a few years ago by an English professor. I wish I had bought the book back then. O'Conner provides an introduction to English grammar that is not only useful, but often funny. Moreover, unlike many books on English grammar, O'Conner manages to avoid using technical jargon. I highly recommend O'Conner's book.
