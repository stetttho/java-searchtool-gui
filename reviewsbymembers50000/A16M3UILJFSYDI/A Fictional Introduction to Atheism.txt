 For years, Christians have promoted the fictional works of C.S. Lewis (e.g., "The Chronicles of Narnia", "The Screwtape Letters", etc.) as an entertaining and insightful presentation of the Christian worldview. Thanks to respected philosopher Michael Martin, atheists finally have a fictional book of their own. The Big Domino in the Sky and Other Atheistic Tales is a fun and thought-provoking collection of short stories in the form of science fiction, historical fiction, and fantasy.
