 THE MEANING OF JESUS is an excellent introduction to the historical Jesus debate written by two respected Christian New Testament scholars.  The conservative position is defended by N.T. Wright while the liberal position by Marcus Borg.  The book itself consists of a series mini-debates on specific historical topics like historical methodology, the sayings of Jesus, the crucifixion, the resurrection, the incarnation, the virgin birth, the second coming, etc.  Unfortunately, because the format of the book only allowed each scholar to write one statement (chapter) on each topic, there was no opportunity for each scholar to respond to the other's arguments.  Still, I thought this book was an excellent introduction to the disagreements in NT scholarship between conservatives and liberals.   One other comment: as someone interested in the historicity of the resurrection, I found N.T. Wright's chapter on the resurrection very helpful.  Although other conservatives have often argued that no first-century Jew could have believed that Jesus was risen from the dead and yet suppose that his corpse rotted in the grave, no other writer has explained that argument as clearly as N.T. Wright.  I'm not sure if I agree with Wright's conclusion, but I appreciated the clarity Wright brought to the discussion.
