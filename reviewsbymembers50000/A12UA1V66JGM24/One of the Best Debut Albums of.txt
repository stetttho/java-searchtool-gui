 I must admit that I was a little hesitant to pick this up after hearing "Turn me on, Mr. Deadman," which is a great song, but sounds, note-for-note, almost exactly like PM5K. But hey, with such a discounted price tag, I figured what the hell, I'll give it a shot. I fully expected to be disappointed, but I was absolutely floored by the rest of the album!!  Very few of the other songs sound anything like PM5K.  There is definitely a heavier Alice In Chains vibe throughout, especially on the choruses and some  of the obvious influences range from Pantera to Disturbed (my other pick for best debut album of 2000). THE album highlight for me is "South Texas Death Ride." (ya motherf*&k!!) - a great song to crank up while sitting at a stoplight next to a family of four returning from church...  "Natural High," "Killing the Fly," "Trip with Jesus," and especially "Bitter" all have huge mainstream rock radio potential with killer power chords and some of the catchiest vocals I've heard in recent years. Granted, the overall sound is a lot like a conglomeration of numerous already popular alternative metal bands (a record company's wet dream and probably the only reason they got signed to a major US label), but these guys do it far better than many of the bands that have influenced their sound and the substandard "filler material" you generally find is virtually non-existent here.  I would easily put this on my list of the top 5 releases of 2000!  If you like to rock and rock hard, these guys are one of the more worthy listens you'll find in the US market!...
