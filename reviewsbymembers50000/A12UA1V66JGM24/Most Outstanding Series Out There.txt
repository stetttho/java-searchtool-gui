 Bob Mayer (AKA Robert Doherty AKA Greg Donegan AKA Joe Dalton AKA Bob McGuire) is truly one of the more masterful newcomers to the sci-fi genre in many, many years.  Intermingling sci-fi with edgy military techo-thriller action, Mayer weaves some of the most enjoyable and imaginative fiction I've ever read with each novel.  I look forward to every book he writes and have yet to be disappointed.  The Area 51 series has been one of the most exciting I've ever read and just when I thought it couldn't get any better, along came the Atlantis series, which is equally as good, if not better. For those in the know about government secrecy on UFOs and the various black projects and secret operations that they have undertaken over the years, you'll find that Mayer truly did his homework on this series. Mayer name-drops numerous actual military projects from Operation: Paperclip to Project Aquarius as bits and pieces of a puzzle that the government has been piecing together since the accidental discovery of an alien mothership hidden in the Nevada mountains so many years ago. From clues hidden in the most remote locations on Earth for thousands of years to new discoveries on the Martian landscape, the complex story continues to unravel the true origin of humankind and each subsequent saga is more fascinating than the last.  Being a special forces trainer himself, the attention to detail as far as the military aspect in Mayer's stories is phenomenal as well.  Bob Mayer is very quickly making a name for himself as one of the finest action authors of the modern age. If the Area 51 series intriques you, be sure not to miss his Atlantis series (under the Donegan pen name) and his military thrillers such as The Omega Missile (Dalton pen name), The Gate (McGuire pen name) and Psychic Warrior (Doherty pen name).  All smashingly good reads!!
