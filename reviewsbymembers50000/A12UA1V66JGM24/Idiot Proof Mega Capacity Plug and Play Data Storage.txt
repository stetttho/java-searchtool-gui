 This product delivered exactly what I was looking for:  a compact, inexpensive, quiet, easy-to-connect external drive with mega capacity that's ready to go with very little installation or hassle.  If you're running Windows 98 SE, you'll need to load some drivers from the CD, but if you have Windows 2000, ME or XP, it's truly a plug and play device and you'll need little more than basic file management skills to start using it (and let's face it, if Windows Explorer is too complicated for you, you should immediately surrender your mousepad to the nearest computer store and hang it up).  With XP, you just plug it in, jack it into your system's USB port, flip the power switch on and Windows immediately recognizes it.  It's that simple - 30 seconds of your time and you're ready to start transferring or backing up files.  A child could install this thing! And whisper quiet is an understatement - I had to put my ear within a foot of the drive to even hear it doing anything.  I transferred about 10 GB worth of vital files via USB port in little over an hour and if you need speed, it's Firewire capable as well.  This drive is also very compact (about the size of most people's hand) and extremely lightweight, so if portability is an issue, this is the product for you and considering the plug and play capability, you can connect to any computer in seconds, so this is the ultimate device for transferring files from computer to computer with speed and ease.  About the only complaint I could possibly come up with is that this is one of the few drives that does not come bundled with any kind of backup software (Norton Ghost, etc.), but for general ease of use, it's still well worth it. I'd recommend this drive to anyone looking for a quick and easy way to plug in and back up huge amounts of data in a snap.  It doesn't get much easier than this!
