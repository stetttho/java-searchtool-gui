 Needless to say, this is one of my most anticipated games in 2003. The beginning of SH3 isn't Silent Hill according to the director. It's a completely different town at first. But they said 'Since its Silent Hill, I guess its safe to say there will be a connection to the town.". Now my speculation on it? The town you start out in is actually Silent Hill. The difference is that its not actually 'formed' yet. If you remember back to SH1, Silent Hill really got created when Allesa wouldn't agree to the demands of Dahlia and the member of her cult to do the ritual that rises Samael. So to get back at her they locked her in a room and set in on fire. The result was that half the town burned down, and that created Silent Hill. So what I think is that Heather is Allesas mum. You start playing as her and the game goes on a longer time period than the previous SH games till the point that Allesa is born. So we basically get to see what started SH from the beginning. The woman we've seen in the trailers, Claudia (she's the real white woman), is a younger version of Dahlia. SH3 seems like it's really going to start showing some answers to the series, and the entire plot should be very interesting. The visulas have also been vastly improved from SH2, and the monster design is extremely wicked. Suffice it to say, if you thought SH2 was scary, then SH3 will downright frighten you. Can't wait for this one.
