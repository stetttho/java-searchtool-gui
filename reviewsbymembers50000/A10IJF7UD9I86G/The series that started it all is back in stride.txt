 My goodness! This has to best of the series edging out TM2 in my opinion. Very fast, handles great and has a *really* fun 4 man multiplayer. There are about 15 different characters(including Sweet Tooth!) and about 11 levels for single player and 18 for multiplayer, so there is alot variety. Some levels are compact and some aremassive, like the Suburbia level for example. Dont ask me how they did it, but they made this game run at an almost perfect 60fps at all times, even with realtime weather conditions on some levels with pouring rain and heavy snow. Thats unbelievable considering all the particle explosion effects, players and landscape this title shows all on screen at once, with no noticeable fog in the background......amazing. The Soundtrack is sweet. Its very dyanamic as well. For example, when there is alot of action on screen, the music will get louder and play more riffs, but for those couple quiet moments, the music will dim down a bit and make things peaceful. It adds so much to the game, espescially i you have a Dolby Surround sound system. The destruction and speed of this game compliments this series really well, taken to the next level with the better technology obviously. The particle effects are amazing and the maneuvers, handling and physics are extremely polished. It is a little difficult but not enough to get frustrated, well maybe sometimes, but definitely challenging. Thankfully there are cheats you can use if its gets too hard. The multiplayer is also a blast. 2 or 4 player splitscreen and stil runs at 60 fps most of the time, even in 4 player! I mean it, this is the most enjoyable multiplayer game I've played in a while. Lot of unlockables, CG stories for each character, short load times, very slick menus and sweet music. There's really nothing I can gripe about. This is THE best car combat game on the market. Again, welcome back Incognito, you made the TM series great once again. Buy it!
