 Got the Toshiba 2700 early last year and I must say, I'm quite impressed. So far it has played everything I put in it, including all the so-called 'problem discs' such as the Matrix. And the picture and sound are top notch. Plays audio cd's, hdcd's, cd-r, cd-rw's and for all you VCD disc collectors, it plays them as well. Has s-vid, composite and component imputs and is DD 5.1/DTS compatable. Has a plethora of options including zoom, slow-mo, 3 audio modes and many other handy features. Plays scratched discs very well, a very durable system that has to be the best in its price range. [...]. Highly recommended.
