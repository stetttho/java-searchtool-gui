 It was either this or the more expensive Sony Wega. Well after 20 minutes of side by side comparisons, I had to go with the Toshiba. The picture is amazing for this size screen. The flat screen puts out super sharp display with very vibrant colors. The sound is also decent for this size range and putting BBE on is a must for quality sound. Whats special about it too, is it has component and s-video inputs. Component(the best possible image connection)are rare for these size screens. But the tv puts out amazing image quality when connected to component or even s-vid. After receiving a PlayStation 2 this holiday season, I really needed something to complement it for its games and dvd movies. So after alot research and side by side comparisons, I made the decision on the Toshiba and I dont regret it a bit. The only gripe I have with it is its remote. A tv of this calibur deserves better and they put a reset button the remote. Thats silly becuase if you accidently press it once it resets all the settings of the tv. I just bought another universal remote for the tv and its alot better. But I recommend this tv to anybody who wants a 20' set. Cant be beat.
