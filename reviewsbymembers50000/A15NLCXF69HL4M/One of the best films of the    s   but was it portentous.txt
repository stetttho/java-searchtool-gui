 So-called reality TV (actually very contrived TV but with non-professionals in front of the camera - some might add also behind the camera) is a very sad and uninspired entertainment cycle which relies upon the exploitation of all that is unpleasant and unattractive in humanity.  The film "Series Seven" brilliantly captures this sadistic aspect of voyeurism, but in 1976 "Network" predicted it all. This is truly one of the very best films of the 1970s.  Every performance is flawless, the script is fascinating, the direction sure-footed enough to contain what could in lesser hands become a campy hysteria.  Every character except Holden's and Finch's is ruthless to the point of inhumanity - especially the cold Dunaway (whose evil delivery of her final line in the film is one of the most shocking and even chilling moments in cinema history). I've always believed that comedy - especially when it is this black - can provide the most cutting insight into human nature.   This is a perfect film.
