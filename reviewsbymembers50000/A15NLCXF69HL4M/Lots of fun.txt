 Why so few of Ralf Konig's wonderfully entertaining gay comics have been translated into English is a mystery to me, but those that are available are a must for any gay man.   This book is a follow-up to "Maybe...maybe not", which I think is also still available in English.  Konig has a very witty insight not just into gay relationships and culture, but also into gay/straight relationships and relationships in general (too many relationships in this sentence?) I never would have thought a comic book could be as sexy as these books are (although the best one I've seen so far is Konig's "Bull's Balls" - v. sexy book!)  It is just so refreshing to see an adult comic presented to and for a gay audience. Konig is a force in Germany and continues to have a very productive output.  Some of his books have been made into films.  In fact, when I was in Germany just a few months back one of the biggest German films that had just been released was based on one of his comics.   Hopefully some day we'll see more of his work translated, but in the meantime, snap up what you can for a fun and sometimes very touching read.
