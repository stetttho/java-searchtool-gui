 Quick summary: don't waste your money on this dull flick, unless you are really keen to see the very attractive actors frolicking topless, and even then beware that there is only one (brief) sex scene - although it is quite a hot one.  It is interesting that the last few years has seen an explosion in gay films on DVD. Not sure what has caused this, but rest assured quantity is not related to quality.  This film is the story of two very handsome young man - a lean, long-limbed, very French looking guy and his boyfriend - a hunkier, very sexy number who many of us will recall from the excellent film "Wild Reeds". They meet in summer when both are very tanned and spending a lot of time on the beach.  They kiss and make love in very poorly lit scenes, and have one rather sexy romp in the sand dunes. Mostly off-camera, it all goes pear-shaped and the skinnier guy goes sort of crazy, develops pale skin and has a lot of very long Meaningful Close-Ups and other long pointless scenes to illustrate his unexplained and uninteresting depression.    This is not a very good film, despite the appeal of the lead actors. It is just another disappointing film that has been attractively packaged to cash in on the obviously thriving "gay genre" DVD. Hardly anything happens in this movie, which is fine if the characters are interesting (and they are not). What does happen occurs mostly off-camera. The support actors are dull (especially the sour-faced anorexic sister). There are a couple of good scenes but they are so infrequent and hidden amongst such a huge amount of boring, pretentious filler that they lose their impact. The script is rambling, the editing  poor. In the hands of a good editor this could have been a good short film maybe, but as a feature it is a dull, overblown failure with delusions of artistic importance.  Get "Wild Reeds" instead - a truly excellent film and starring the sexier half of the dup trying valiantly to save "Come Undone."
