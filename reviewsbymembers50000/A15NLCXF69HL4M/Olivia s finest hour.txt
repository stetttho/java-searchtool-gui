 I recently re-discovered this excellent CD. This album marks the first (and so far only) time Olivia wrote all of the songs on one of her albums. Written during and after her battle with breast cancer, it is an incredibly personal and life affirming album - a total joy to listen to. The lyrics are personal, the music is fresh and exciting.  This is a must have for any fan - and if you have never really been a fan but are curious this is the album to buy.
