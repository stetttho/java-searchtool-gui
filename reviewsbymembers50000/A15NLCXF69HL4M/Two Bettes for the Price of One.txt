 I love Bette Davis, who could turn even the most dull films into pure excitement with her pure energy. This luckily is not a dull film. Bette plays twin sisters, one good the other bad (isn't that always the case with these things?) The bad one steals the good one's lover, and the good one rather uncharacteristically steals the bad one's life when she is killed in an exciting boating accident. The photogrpahy is excellent, there being only a few scenes where it is obvious one of the two Bettes is on a rear projection. The story starts slowly but really takes off after a while. One wonders just how it is she is going to get out of this mess when she discovers her sister's life was not all it had seemed. This is also a fascinating film from a feminist perspective. At first I thought it was all very racy and immoral, what with the heroine allowing her family to think she is dead and then impersonating her sister, and all that extra-marital sex going on. Then I realised that in fact it is a very moral film: the good sister is sexually repressed, yearns for a man who dumped her for her raunchier sister, and allows herself to be insulted by a deadbeat painter.  The bad sister by contrast is sexually liberated and is punished with divorce and death. It's all highly enjoyable fare.
