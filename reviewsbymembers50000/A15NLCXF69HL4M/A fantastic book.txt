 I wanted to buy a really good book about London after returning from a recent visit there.  I was a little wary buying a book such as this over the 'net, but I have to say I was not disappointed with this gem. It is a classy, beautiful book, packed with slighlty off-beat information that is more than just a summary of what you read in your travel guides.  The pictures are just gorgeous, not only capturing what I discovered of London during my all-too-brief trip, but also uncovering so much more. If you want a great book about London, then this is the one for you.
