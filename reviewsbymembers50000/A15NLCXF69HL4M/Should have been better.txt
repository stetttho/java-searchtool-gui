 This film starts promisingly, with an attractive cast, a great story premise, good production values and a good soundtrack. I really wanted to like this film. Sadly, it soon went off the rails and never really recovered. I hated the entire last third of the film and the awful ending.  The lead actor (not the one on the cover, the other guy) is a total hunk and quite a good actor too. The rest of the cast is also very good, but, in the main, the supporting actors (such as the wonderful Deborah Harry, whose impressive musical career always seems to overshadow the fact that she is actually a very talented actor who always chooses edgy and interesting material) are wasted and totally under-developed. The story focuses only on the two male leads, and since one of those characters is very unappealing, self-absorbed and, sorry to sound harsh, but basically just boring, that does not lead the film too many places to slide but downhill. I wanted to like this film, and I would say that if you're interested you should watch it, but don't bother buying it.
