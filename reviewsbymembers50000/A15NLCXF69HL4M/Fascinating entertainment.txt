 Douglas Sirk's films are enjoying a renaissance of sorts thanks to Todd Haynes and the excellent "Far From Heaven".  1959's "Imitation of Life" was, I believe, Sirk's last film and it certainly is a cracker. The story is ostensibly about Turner, who not only looks radiant throughout but delivers a top-rate performance as a self-centred actress who neglects her loving daughter (Dee), and her relationship with her black housekeeper and friend  (Moore, who is fabulous).  Moore's troubled and resentful daughter (Kohner, also fabulous) passes for white, and it is this aspect of the story that is most powerful.   Visually, the film has all the trappings of a glossy Ross Hunter production from the '50s (trappings which were revitalised so well in the '80s primetime soap operas): beautiful people, beautiful clothes and settings, high levels  of drama.  What makes this film so special, and prevents it from descending anywhere into the territory of camp, is the grittiness beneath that glossy surface, the very interesting and multi-faceted quartet of female characters, and the great performances by the 4 actresses.   Worth watching again and again.
