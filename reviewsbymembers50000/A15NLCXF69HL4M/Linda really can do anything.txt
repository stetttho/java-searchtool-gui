 Linda Ronstadt is a genius.  Few other artists have successfully explored as many genres as she, from here very popular though perhaps slightly pedestrian rock hits in the '70s and early '802, through bluegrass, Mexican, Cajun and Latin jazz, kids lullabies, big ballads, bid band, the woman can not only master anything but - although she chooses to record very infrequently these days, she also improves indisputably with age. So, my bias is, I am a fan. That aside, this 1980 album was a major change of pace for Linda and one which still sounds incredibly fresh today.  I really like her working of Neil Young's "Look Out For My Love", and the songs "Cost of Love" and "Can't Let Go".  You don't need to be a student or even particularly a fan of New Wave to enjoy this great little album.   I know Linda has definitely moved away from this type of music now, and who can begrude such a talented lady wanting to constantly progress and evolve artistically (particularly when that evolution includes gems such as the uptempo "Frenesi" album, the first of the two Trio albums, and the wonderfully moving '99 duo album with Emmylou Harris), but still it seems a shame that she didn't make at least one more New Wave album like "Mad Love".
