 Olivia Newton John has been quiet since her '70s and '80s heyday, but this album proves that true talent only grows stronger as years pass. This album is truly a delightful surprise - the arrangements are understated, the vocals confident, mature and self-assured.  This is an excellent album for any Olivia fan or for anyone seeking to discover why so many people are so fond of Ms Newton John's beuatiful velvet voice.
