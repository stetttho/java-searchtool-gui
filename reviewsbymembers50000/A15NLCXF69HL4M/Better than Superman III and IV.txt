 When I first saw this film on TV in the late '80s, I was of course struck by the wonderful comedy of Dunaway, Vacarro and Peter Cook, but otherwise thought it was awful.   In a second viewing years later I can appreciate this film much more.  The special effects are good; the flying sequences are actually beautiful.  Slater is better than I remembered her too.   Supergirl lacks the sense of wonder that Superman and Superman II had, but it really is a very fun film and in all honesty, it is vastly superior to the last two Superman films.  Sure, this one has camp elements to it, but I really think it adds to the enjoyment.   I find it hard to really hate any film with Faye Dunaway, but even putting that bias aside Supergirl does not deserve its stinker reputation - as other reviewers here have obviously also discovered. The DVD edition is great, but I find it a little sad watching the making of documentary in which cast and crew prematurely discuss the film's imminent blockbuster status and Helen Slater's imminent superstar status.  Perhaps they jinxed it?
