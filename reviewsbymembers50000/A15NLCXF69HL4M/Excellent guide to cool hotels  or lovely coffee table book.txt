 This book has lovely photographs and useful descriptions of some very trendy hotels all over the world. I have found the book a very useful guide for finding cool hotels to stay in - it can be so hard to find a really good hotel and this book really helps in that regard. Of course, you need not use it as a guide and there are many cities in this book that I have yet to visit - the pictures are lovely and you can enjoy the book as a visual feast whether you are looking for a place to stay or not.
