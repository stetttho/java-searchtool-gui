 This is a great little book (actually, two books in one).  I laughed put loud throughout it and hoped that it would never end.  "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is rightly considered a classic, its sharp and bitingly witty insight is something one never seems to see in a book today (indeed, humour in a book today seems to be rare - sometimes it seems that all new fiction books are depressing and morbid; and if you feel this way too then you should read Loos' clever and refreshing novels).  This is a classuc that you will want to read over and over.
