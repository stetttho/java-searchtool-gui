 Beautiful scenery, an involving story and a lovely score, a fantastic and very attractive cast - this movie has everything to recommend it. Generally, it is hard for any film with Maggie Smith not to be fantastic ("Tea with Mussolini" an exception I suppose), and she gives a remarkably restrained performance here that is perfect for her character Charlotte. One can't help but wonder what a mess would have been made of the film had another actor had this pivotal part that could so easily have been overplayed. Helena Bonham Carter gives a lovely performance and is stunningly beautiful, and it is interesting to watch this film and compare it to the performance she would give many years later in "The Wings of the Dove" (which I personally consider her acting masterpiece to date, and a film which is criminally under-acknowledged). Julian Sands is also just right as her suitor, and it is sad to think that, of all the actors in this film, his is the only career which probably peaked with this film. The locations in Italy and England are breathtaking.
