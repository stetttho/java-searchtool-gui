 I love Joan Van Ark as I love all of the former Knots Landing ladies, but this film was really awful and unworthy of her talents. The story becomes increasingly implausible as it progresses to its stupid finale. I hate suspense films that revolve around female protagonists being stupid, and this sadly is one of them.
