 This is one of "those" made-for-cable thrillers that seemed so popular during the '90s in which great 1940s film plots were ripped off, mixed with a bit of sex, and acted out by not quite a-list actors such as Andrew Stevens.   The plot of Rubdown, whilst a little bit implausible (washed up sports star becomes massuer and is lured into murderous plot with scheming wife of passive rich guy) is sufficiently complicated, and the cast, headed by the always interesting and rather sexy Michelle Phillips, is unusual to say the least: there's Phillips' former "Knots Landing" husband Bill Devane in a small but pivotal role, former "Dynasty" siblings Jack Coleman and Catherine Oxenberg playing lovers, and even that earnest father from "Growing Pains" Alan Thicke. It's not exactly a sensational mystery film, but it is diverting and interesting, and the relationship between Phillips and Coleman is also unusual given that she is, dare I point out, quite a bit older than him, so I think it is brave (and applaudable) casting.
