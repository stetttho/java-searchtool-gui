 This is a beautiful album.  Not all of the songs are perfect, sure, and some are notably deficient in comparison with the others, but as for those others - boy!   The title track is an achingly honest song, beautiful and painful at once and more moving with each listen.  The ballads with Linda Ronstandt are not of the same standard as those they shared on her excellent '89 album "Cry Like a Rainstorm...", but they are still head and shoulders above most pop ballads you will hear. Although some of the songs are not stand-outs for me personally, it must be said that the entire album does have a lovely, almost dreamlike sound to it which is actually very effective in its flow from track to track, and that is something that, I think, is becoming ever rarer these days in pop albums. Buy this album, give it several listens, and I challenge you not to become seduced by it.
