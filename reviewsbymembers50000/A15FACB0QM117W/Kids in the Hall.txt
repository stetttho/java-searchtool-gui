 If you ever watched the old Kids in the Hall show, the theme song was written by these guys.  It's on this album known as "Having an Average Weekend".  Savvy Show Stoppers is a great collection of surf guitar instrumentals all in the spirit of "Having an Average Weekend. Orginal rhythms permeate the album, but there isn't a lot variation on the songs.  They're all about the same pace.  Think of this as a surf guitar jam album.  It's just the band jamming away on slightly different rhythms.  Somehow it doesn't detract from the album's appeal though.
