 I've been subscribing for a couple of years now.  The quick laundry list: 1. My favorite bit is there tends to be a diverse selection of guitar players and lessons.  One month may be jazz heavy, another may be blues heavy, and sometimes there is even some punk/metal stuff thrown in.  As a player I enjoy blues and metal, but I enjoy the diversity as it spawns ideas.  Also note that while there are main stream guitarists covered there are also a lot of more obscure folks covered as well. 2. Yes there are a lot of ads.  Show me a magazine that isn't loaded with ads these days tho'. 3. Yes there are a lot of gear reviews.  Great if you're a gear head - not so good if you could care less.  Usually at least 50% reviews 50% lessons, sometimes more on the review side. 4. I've been playing for a few years now and find most of the lessons are generally intermediate to advanced and assume you are fairly well versed in music theory.  I don't count myself as an extraordinary guitar player though.  I ended up buying a few music theory books to help me understand the lessons after a few issues.  Frustrating but a great challenge! 5. No there are no tabs of the latest or oldest hits out there. Everything in this magazine revolves around learning to make music, not copy somebody else note for note. All in all a decent enough magazine.  I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 just because I'm a bit against all the gear reviews and the lessons are sometimes too brief or vague to be useful for me.
