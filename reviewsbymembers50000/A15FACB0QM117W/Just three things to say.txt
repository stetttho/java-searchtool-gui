 1. I love metal as much as the next metal head but this is NOT a metal album - get over it!  If your sole review comprises 3 stars because this isn't metal you really need to consider broadening your horizons.  2. Apart from metal I also love all other kinds of music including classical, blues, folk, jazz, fusion, flamenco, etc. etc.  This IS some really good acoustic guitar and piano music.  Buy it! You won't regret it!  3. If you liked this album check out Zakk with Black Label Society - Hangover Music Vol 6.  More of the same though there are a few heavier tunes mixed in.  Not quite the normal full on BLS heavy but a little heavier.
