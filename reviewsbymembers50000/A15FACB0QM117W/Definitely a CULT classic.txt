 Ok...throw in Gary Busey, Mr. T (remember him?), Paul Rodriguez, Mr. Rhythm, Bill Maher (way early days!), and you've got one really bad movie! However if you like insane mindless fun this is definitely a great flick. The acting is terrible, the story is predictable, but the general mindless humor is too much. Frankly this is a complete love/hate kind of movie, with a cult classic status! Quick synopsis.  A cab company is swiftly being driven out of business by it's competition.  The cabbies all have bad attitudes and are content to await the inevitable.  Along comes junior who brings purpose and pride back to the cabbies, eventually booting their competition out of town and saving the day. Along the way great character development occurs as you explore the personal tragedies and problems of some of the cabbies and see them overcome their fears, problems, and issues.  How many guys do you know that yell at their wife trying to find their flamethrower??? The humor in this movie is much along the lines of old Saturday Night Live.  It doesn't take itself seriously, which is why it works.
