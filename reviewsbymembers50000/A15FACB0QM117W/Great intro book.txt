 This book is a great introduction to DSP.  It provides solid mathematical background along with verbage to explain what the math means, pseudo-code algorithms for actually applying the concepts to software, and TONS of worked design examples and figures to aid understanding.   Also lots of references to where in the real-world the topics are used. Particularly in the area of audio processing.
