 This book presents a nice overview of the primary components of J2EE architecture.  If you're looking for gory details on J2EE technologies this isn't your text. As with any multi-author book the writing style varies wildly.  All the examples are extremely trivial.  The important part is you get explanation about how all the fundamental pieces of J2EE work together and what they do.  Everything from Java Server Pages, to EJBs, JNDI, JMS, Web Servers (no real coverage on Web Services), different app servers, JAAS, JTA, etc. Nice reference book for high level or simple questions when you're trying to learn the ropes.  Basically useless for any hard core implementation efforts.
