 If you enjoy Stevie Ray Vaughn and Chris Duarte you'll love this album.  While not quite the virtuoso SRV is, Monti does a great job laying down classic blues/rock. At first listen I actually thought this was Chris Duarte.  Monti's voice and style are almost identical.  The guitar work is solid and clean and the backing band is tight.  Monti's effects chain is a dead ringer for SRV or Chris Duarte.  Most of the rhythms are pretty canned, reminiscent of Chuck Berry, SRV, and Chris Duarte.  I particularly enjoyed Shake a Leg Meg, and Purple Heart though.  Each had hints of aforementioned influence with a slight twist. If you like the southern blues style this album is a great buy!
