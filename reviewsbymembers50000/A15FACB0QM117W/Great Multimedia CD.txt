 This is my first Maiden enhanced CD.  Unbelievable extras!!  The multimedia studio did a top notch job.  The menu system and layout are extremely well done and the graphics are everything you'd expect from a Maiden production.  Derek Riggs would be proud! I particularly enjoyed the video clips, though the resolution was a little low.  Phantom has always been a personal favorite. I also really appreciated that they included everything you need to view the multimedia portion of the disk, right on the disk.  I only have dial-up access so it's painful when you have to wait a while to see something because the download takes forever. Otherwise all the audio trimmings you'd expect from the original Iron Maiden album. My only complaint, and thus the 4 stars instead of 5, is my old Sony Discman refuses to recognize this as an audio CD.  So I can't listen to it outside of my computer.  I haven't experimented further with that yet to see if it's the disk or my player, but I would guess it's my player.  It's only 7 years old...
