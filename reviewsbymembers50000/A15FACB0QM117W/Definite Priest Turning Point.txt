 Everything Sad Wings of Destiny is, this album is not.  JP begins delving into more of a speed metal/industrial feel with this album.  A little more techno sounding in nature with more predictable canned rhythms. Rob Halford is, as always, over the top with vocals, and the rest of the band keeps him aloft.  I've been a Priest fan for years, and I can safely say this isn't their best work.  Still this album isn't without merit.  Blood Red Skies has got some great riffs and some catchy if not too repetitive drums, and Hard As Iron just plain rocks (drive fast tune if I ever heard one). A good album if you're more into industrial music, but if you're expecting the same old JP from Defenders of the Faith or Screaming for Vengeance days skip it.
