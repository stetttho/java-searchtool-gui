 I can't speak to the code examples, since I'm usually more interested in the "how to" theory, rather than trying to find mistakes in the book so I can whine about them.  My only complaint would be that some of the early code samples are  a little too trivial if you already have heavy programming experience.  Perfect if you're a complete novice. The book begins with a general overview of .NET and how C# fits into .NET including a little history, and an introduction to the basic tools you'll be using.  I was a little disappointed that the text didn't cover too many details on setting up the .NET environment and tool suite, so I can only hope that Microsoft has provided the usual setup packages to make this easy.  The book start by breaking up the .NET/C# architecture and tool suite into small pieces and each piece is reviewed showing how the piece fits into the global whole and how it all works together.  There are enough gory details to satisfy your curiosity but not so many you get bored. From there the basic architecture is built up in detail, with progressively more complex topics and code samples; including coverage of some of the most commonly used namespaces for building programs such as general I/O, constructing GUIs etc. This book covers the language fundamentals of C# and talks about some of the more commonly used namespaces for building web services, GUI's, etc.  It is not a comprehensive API documentation guide!  Look elsewhere if you want a reference guide! While computer books tend to be extremely dry I found this book paced such that it was actually an enjoyable read and I got a lot out of it.  Certainly a worthy introductory text to get your feet wet and get you started on C# and .NET.
