 I had given up on WASP until a friend turned me onto this album for "one last try".  If you don't have any other WASP album, at least get this one! If you've followed WASP from the early days you'll hear that somewhere in the making of this album they grew up.  Gone are the shallow lyrics saturated with sexual innuendos, non-innuendos, and jabber about boozing yourself to death. You know, lyrics easily grasped by your average 13 year old?  Instead thoughful musings about life and the world we live in abound.  Ok, they digress a little bit, but not in near the fashion of the old days.  Blackie Lawless still sings like he's got a bunch of those old saw blades stuck in his throat.  A signature of the WASP sound remains, fear not. The music matured with the band too.  Gone are 100% pre-canned, tired, metal riffs strummed with some idea that rhythm may exist, and a sort of catchy melody thrown on top.  Instead?  Solid, fat, rhythms, with interesting melodies and counter-melodies have taken their place.  The bass drives harder than a Harley on a dirt road, and the drums are rock solid!  Together they are solid metal worth listening to!
