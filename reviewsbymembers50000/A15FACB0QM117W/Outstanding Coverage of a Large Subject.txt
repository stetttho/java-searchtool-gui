 I started out knowing very little about EJB's when I picked up this book.  I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed! The first three chapters give a 10,000 foot view about the role of EJB's in J2EE.  Bean lifecycles are covered, container interaction, deploytment processes, etc. is all covered in a general and friendly manner.  A little bit of code is presented to illustrate key points and help you start thinking about how to write code. The chapters following really drill down into the guts of entity, session (state and stateless), and message driven EJBs. Simple code examples are presented and taken apart, with detailed explanation about why certain things are the way they are, and how things work.  Outstanding theory here!  You get down into the nitty gritty about deployment descriptors, state diagrams, the works. There are also nice reference Appendices providing state transition diagrams, API references, etc. What impressed me most about this book is the author's careful distinction between EJB 1.1 and EJB2.0 specifications, including code samples of each, and the raw level of detail about how beans work. The bad part about this book is it assumes you know a lot of other fundamental technologies such as XML, JNDI, and JMS.  I highly recommend you have references available on these technologies during reading if you're trying to learn the big picture at the same time.  People who are really into code examples and not theory may also be a little disappointed by the simplicity of the examples given. All in all a great buy!
