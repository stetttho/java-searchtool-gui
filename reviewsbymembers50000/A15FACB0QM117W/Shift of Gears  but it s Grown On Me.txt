 I was stoked to see a new KMFDM album!  KMFDM is by far one of my favorite bands, largely because I can listen to their albums literally dozens of times in a row and hear something different every time.  Their music is so interwoven with different rhythms and sounds it takes a long time to sort them all out. At first listen I felt kind of ripped off.  A commercialized metal album was coming out of my speakers!  Not the typical mass of tangled sound.  Had I written this review after my first listen this album would have received 2 stars for being such a let down. First thing you will notice is a lot of heavy distorted guitar and a more regular drum kit in your face.  This is where my commercial rip-off came in.  Has KMFDM lost their mind and gone commercial metal?  Fortunately I continued listening to the album in the background while I did some other stuff and I began to mentally throw away the in your face guitar and drums and see more of the old school KMFDM riding the background. The alluring female vocals are still there, and the synthesizer work is still there.  Yeah, some of the songs are a little too repetitive, but after I got used to the more commercial feel that's in your face I started to like this album a lot!  It's got enough good tunes to make a worthy buy.
