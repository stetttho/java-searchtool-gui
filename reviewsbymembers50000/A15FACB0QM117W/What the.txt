 I know a lot of old school bands are trying to "re-create" themselves and connect with the younger generation, but this is one of the most radical and dismal departures I've heard to date.  Metallica has shed almost everything that is their trademark sound. Lars sounds like he's playing on cooking pots in his Mom's kitchen or something. James is just wallowing in a sea of less than thought provoking lyrics, trying to hold some sort of rhythm, and lamely attempts to really sing between screams. Kirk just sounds bored - if you can pick him out at all. I can't fault Rob because he just signed on to this mess.  Rob, you should have stayed with Ozzy. There isn't a single guitar solo - not one on the whole album.  What is Metallica without those blistering solos? There is relatively little melody or harmony in any of the songs.  The guitar tone is nice and hard, reniniscent of Kill Em All, but the overall music comes out sounding like a train wrecking.  I used to like Metallica because they had these heavy, precise rhythms with all kinds of cool stuff going on over the top.  That's gone. Worst of all the songs are LONG LONG LONG and seem to just go on forever with no real direction or purpose. I would've given this album 1 star, but the bonus DVD was a pretty cool idea and pretty well done so I'm throwing in a sympathy star despite the "music".  I hope to see other bands taking the lead with DVDs, but skip the music lead.
