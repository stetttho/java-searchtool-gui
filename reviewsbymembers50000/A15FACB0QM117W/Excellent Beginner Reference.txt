 A catalog of problem-solution patterns that pertain to J2EE.  A great reference for beginners, instructing in some of the do's and don'ts of J2EE development.  Much of the material presented has appeared on the Server Side, or in the J2EE core patterns from Sun, but this book presents the material in a concise easy to read format. General Topics include:  1. use of data transfer objects (DTOs) 2. architecture mechanisms to help promote team development 3. transaction and persistance patterns 4. key generation 5. code interaction patterns to help allevite performance bottlenecks. 6. multi-tier architectures and how to optimize them. There is also a short chapter on using JUnit and Ant to automate your environment, but they are so brief they really serve as more of a sales point to investigate these technologies rather than giving any real info on how to use them. Probably the most useful chapter was the last one which covered a number of tips and tricks to make EJB development easier. All in all as a beginner I got a lot of useful information out of this book.  A seasoned developer will probably find a few things of interest, but will likely already know much of the material from the J2EE core patterns and personal experience.
