 Ok now.  These people reviewing on 21 and 22 July have got me going now.  I suppose they think that Duke Ellington, Robert Johnson, Sinatra, Streisand, Mozart, Beethoven, Dylan, Greenday, Pink Floyd, Oasis, Hendrix, Metallica, Arlen, Armstrong, Glenn Miller, Haydn, Stones, Richard Rodgers, Rachmaninoff, Verdi, Puccini, Bon Jovi, Foo Fighters ETC. ETC. ETC. are all worthless. Think again.  The one person is a youngster and too young to know. The other person (as Shakespeare says) "Thou art a very ragged wart."  Sorry, but this album is a favorite along with many thousands that are in my mind and heart.
