 She is so gifted.  Almost any of her albums will inspire "if" you have an open mind.  Rock, theatre, light opera, fantasy, inspiring, and I could go on and on.  Her stage presance is flawless.  The voice of pure excitement.  I have seen a few stage productions and now if I could just see Streisand my world would almost be complete.  Simply an extraordinary talent.
