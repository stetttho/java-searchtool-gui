 This is not metal.  This is some of the most exciting, beautful rock that I have heard in a long, long time.  In fact, I have nothing to compare it to.  How can one explain an adventure with each note.  You must experience this.  Track five takes off on Albinoni's Adaigo and weaves sounds never heard before by my ears.  Sounds that ....well...sounds of life.  Please listen more than once and experience this extraordinary beauty.
