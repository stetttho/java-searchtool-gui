 Get a life out there in Bakersfield.    Get a handle on different music.  Get a hint on the rest of the world.  Take on some Peruvian tunes.  I love Greenday as well as the next person but they aren't the only fish in the sea.  Open up.  Take on - oh may I dare say - A BROADWAY MUSICAL. Take on "MUSIC."  Not just what's popular.  Enjoy some MELODY.  Enjoy life more.  Enjoy Ellington, Mozart, Inxs, Sarah Brightman, IQ, Spanky and Our Gang, Bowie, Coldplay, Dido, ETC. Please open up to an entire world of wonderous music.  A toast to your new musical adventures.
