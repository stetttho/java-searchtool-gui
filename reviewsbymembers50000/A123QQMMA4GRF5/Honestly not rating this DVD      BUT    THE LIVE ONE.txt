 I wish Amazon would give us more information on this.  In the meantime, I have the Alan Parsons Live from Madrid which is what every Alan Parsons fan wants.  Click on alanparsonsmusic.com and you should find this nice DVD.  The band on this live dvd is well orchestrated and pretty much everything you would want (could have had a sax player and a few more tunes but that's ok.)  I will take anything I can get with great pleasure.  Enjoy.
