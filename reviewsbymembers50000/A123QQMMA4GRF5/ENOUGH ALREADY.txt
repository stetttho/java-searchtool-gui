 I FINALLY BOUGHT A BOOTLEG VERSION DVD.  I HAVE NEVER BOUGHT ANYTHING BOOTLEGGED TO MY KNOWLEDGE ANYWAY.  I ALWAYS SUPPORT THE ARTS.  BUT ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH.  FOR GOD SAKES I COULD BE DEAD BY THE TIME THIS COMES OUT.  MY BOOTLEGGED DVD IS JUST PERFECT. 5 STARS FOR THE BOOTLEGGED VERSION. I HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE "PRODUCED PACKAGE" ANYMORE.
