 in the early seventies, my father and I went to Las Vegas.  "Dad, I will go to Pete Fountain if you will go to Elvis."  He smiled because he knew I wanted to see Pete as much as he wanted to see Elvis.  My father, a self taught musician, was in music heaven that night (so was I) Pete's music is meant to "breath in."  Life doesn't get much better than this.
