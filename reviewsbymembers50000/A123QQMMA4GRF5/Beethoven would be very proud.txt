 This Hogwood series is simply beautiful.  Never "rushed" like Karajan. I grew up listening to Bernstein's Youth Concerts so there was always a certain fondness for Lenny.  But this Hogwood series to me is far better than Bernstein, Sir Solti or even Abbado.  Period instruments that take you to another time.  Beethoven's time.
