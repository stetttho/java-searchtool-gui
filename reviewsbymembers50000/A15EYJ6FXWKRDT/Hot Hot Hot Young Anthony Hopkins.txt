 Okay, that was a joke,  'Hot, hot..." is a line from the movie...But he was quite dashing.  C'mon! That's why I bought it!  Otherwise,  this super-creepy film doesn't really merit a second glance.  Once is enough.  Marsha Mason plays frazzled again- and she is good at it.  Tony Hopkins makes a nice father figure.  (But then you see glimpses of Hannibal coming through). This is a film best given to the local psychic  for seance material, or as a Halloween Party Door Prize.  Or just watch it for fun.  I did say it was Creepy...
