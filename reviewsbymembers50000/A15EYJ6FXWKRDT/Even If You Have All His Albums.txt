 There is the beautiful book cover in purple, there are the lyrics printed in verse format...but mostly , there are the scrawling, handwritten notations of a [pick your adjective]  madman/poet/devout/philosopher/philanderer. And the drawings Nick Cave makes...oh my, he seems to be at war with himself and that is Really interesting.  You will enjoy seeing different lyric versions, and his writing in progress as things get crossed out and then re-written.  This book is definitely a must have for the Nick Cave devotee.
