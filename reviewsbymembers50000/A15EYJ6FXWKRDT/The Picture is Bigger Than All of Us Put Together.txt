 I got the message right away...Jimmy Little is gifted with a voice that is so lilting and unique, it's unreal.  He was the first Aboriginal musician to break into the limelight in the 60's and brings an interesting twist to these mellow cover songs.   Many of the songs are delicate productions that are  reminiscent of a dance hall balladeer singing the final song of the night as the janitor sweeps the floor around that last couple still swaying...  There are themes here of love, loss, and society that are universal. And there is also a merging of musical styles that is hard to pin down. You then realize that trying to stick Jimmy Little into the limiting nature of a category would make you miss the point all together. He is who he is, and that is what makes his music beautiful.  That is the message.
