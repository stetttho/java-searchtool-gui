 While travelling in Athens, Greece, I passed up the chance to buy a hand -hammered, copper milk frother. Oh, the sleep lost over this moment of "misplaced, stupid cheapness" was adding up...Then, serendipity! I saw this stainless steel pitcher for sale here. At the very same price they wanted for the handmade one in Athens! (told you I was cheap.) I would not let THIS one get away.  First of all, the pitcher is beautiful with its mirror-like finish. It will never rust. Alas! On the first use, I burned the milk! It washed right away after soaking for 5 minutes. The bottom is flat, doesn't rock on the burner, the handle is plenty long to keep your hands out of the flames, and the feel is heavy duty- very important. A hole at the end of the handle has allowed for useful hanging over the stove. Looks good on display. Maybe it was the spell cast on me in Greece, it might be the cocoa, who knows? Make your loved one feel very special/fancy/loved. Make them something warm on a winter night!
