 This TV show won all those Emmy Awards for a very good reason. It was simply the most entertaining, artistic, challenging, captivating program on the box in years. Nothing has topped it yet in pure escapist value. Inventive magic! The dynamics between all the characters makes the viewer yearn to belong to a Utopian Cicely of their own. Even though you can see the actors in their new roles trying to get their bearings, feeling out who they are going to be,  this pilot episode features a smooth ensemble cast.  They seemed to sense they'd be together for quite  awhile.  5 years in fact!  Joel provides constant City Mouse/Country Mouse contrast. This is the thinking person's TV.
