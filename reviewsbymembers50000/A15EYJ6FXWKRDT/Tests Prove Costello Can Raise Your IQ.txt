 One of the greatest lyricists of our time, Costello continues to challenge the listener with articulate lines that stick out from each of his albums.  On this one, it's "she slaps your face like a tambourine..."    This  timeless album does not disappoint lyrically, or musically.    If you worried that Elvis had wandered far ever since the Brodsky Quartet collaboration, fear not.  "When I Was Cruel" proves in every song that E.C. never went away at all.  He was just compiling material for us.  Bringing back sounds from "Imperial  Bedroom" and "Spike",  "All This Useless Beauty" and "Mighty Like A Rose", his new album places you in several eras at once.  "How can this be?" you ask...well,   the nature of the album asks the listener to be introspective, and it involves some time travel on your part.   Upon listening, it makes you feel as though his whole life has culminated to this- this perfect album that tells it all and integrates all of E.C.'s multiple personalities into one.  The man knows how to say things like no other,  and his timing couldn't be more perfect.  Who else could make us feel nostalgic and futuristic at the same time? Forget labels, forget status,  "When I Was Cruel" simply perpetuates Elvis Costello as this - a  Brilliant Rock -n- Roller.
