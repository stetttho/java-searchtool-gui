 This film is watchable a hundred times over.  It is one of the Most Romantic stories ever told.  If you cherish the written word and find unrequited love unbearable but  intriguing,  then this Anthony Hopkins/Anne Bancroft movie is for you!   As you watch two strangers fall in love through letters (and over twenty years of time),  you will realize that the epistolary relationship these two had was incredibly special and bittersweet as they never got to meet face to face.  A heartbreakingly true story,  let us hope that Helene and Frank have now met on the "other side" as both of them have passed on.  Beautifully acted,  well directed,  and as a nice touch, the occasional speaking to the audience makes you feel privaleged to know them.
