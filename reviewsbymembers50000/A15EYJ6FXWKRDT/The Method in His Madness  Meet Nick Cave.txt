 Artist? Hedonist? Rock n Roller? This book reveals Nick as all of these, and yet with his integrity intact. The book places him on his deserved pedestal but still manages to dish up dirt, as told by Nick's detractors from the fickle media circus of the '80s. After reading of his battles and struggles - artistically and with his own demons, I enjoyed his music even more knowing he worked damn hard to be heard. The book sheds light on what he was up against. Filled with intimate photo portraits and quotes from Nick's friends, "Life and Music..." is a lovely biography that leaves you informed, but wanting much more. A lot of the copy is dedicated to disography. I wished for more insight into his personal life, psychologically. Physically, the book is huge and loosely bound, feeling unstable,ready to spill. Much like The Cavester himself perhaps. 4 stars for lack of much interview with Cave personally. But 4 stars for a satisfying peek into his world.
