 I did it, and so can you.  Right down to going to the fabulous New York Cake and Bakery Dist. store in NYC, I followed all her easy instructions.  The pearlized, powder for painting the icing made my cake shimmer like nothing I'd created before.  People gave me compliments on a party cake I made for 3 days straight!  I  felt almost guilty for plagarizing,  but Margaret Braun shares her secrets with such generosity!  Reading more like a diary than a cookbook,  "Cakewalk..." is a love letter from her to the cake decorating enthusiast.  If you are ready to take your art one step further,  then this inspiring book is absolutely for you.
