 "The universe is shaped exactly like the earth/if you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were," Modest Mouse lead vocalist and guitarist Isaac Brock muses in "3rd Planet," which opens the group's compelling new release.  Propelled magically by Brock's quavering, unsteady voice and eerie, interstellar visions, "3rd Planet" brilliantly sets the tone for what follows: a strange, allusive indie-music journey into an often bleak landscape of yearning souls, agitated minds and oddly hopeful hearts.   The Moon and Antarctica is startling not simply in its own right, but for the distance Modest Mouse travels beyond the angular sound and dislocated territory previously charted in The Lonesome Crowded West and This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About. Brock, drummer Jeremiah Green and bassist Eric Judy bass tamp down the abrasive guitar attacks, trading raw industrial strength for a dense but ethereal sound that perfectly echoes the recording's existential underpinnings.  The juxtaposition of "The Starts Are Projectors" and "Wild Packs of Family Dogs" best captures Mouse's thematic and structural ambitions. "Stars" is a dreamy, unsettling projection of one's life from a spatial distance that dissolves into a haunting haze of violin and electronica. Brock then opens "Dogs" with some folksy guitar strumming while matter-of-factly narrating how "a wild pack of family dogs came running through the yard as my little sister played/The dogs took her away and I guess she was eaten ok." Imagine the vans carrying Pavement and Radiohead involved in a violent collision on a sidestreet named after the Pixies; then you can begin to appreciate that Modest Mouse has created a shimmering musical architecture with its own internal rules and logic. Working on the level of meditation and fugue, The Moon and Antarctica achieves a captivating edginess that is tribute to Brock's warped but fully-formed view of the world.
