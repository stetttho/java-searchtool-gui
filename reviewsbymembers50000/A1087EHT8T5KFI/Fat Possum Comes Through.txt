 I'm not sure what to make of the Fat Possum label -- Exploiters? Archivists? Precious signifiers? All of the above? -- but this release is full-throttle and full-throated. The high-octane interplay between McDowell and Woods has an almost primal ferocity; you can tell each note matters deeply, as if it were the musicians' last. A rousing listen, from start to finish.
