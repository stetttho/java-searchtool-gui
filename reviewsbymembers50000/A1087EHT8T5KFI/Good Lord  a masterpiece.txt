 "Being way too tall for any self regulation/I'd invite the devil in and his entire nation/What in tarnation?" So asks frontman Howe Gelb in "Raw," one of the seemingly countless American Beauties he's  created in the service of examing yourself, lacerating yourself and  laughing at yourself whilst whistling by the old graveyard. (Helpful hint:  the devil and his nation are the guests that never leave.) By turns  funky, psychedelic and folksy, "Chore of Enchantment" touches so  many emotional rails over the course of its languorous sojourn that you  can't quite tell what's jolting you.  Its truths are harsh, humorous,  ironic and frighteningly on target, from gum drop stains revealing an  absent heart on "Astonished" to a drunken binge that reconnects  lost nights with fearful days on "Way to end the day."  When Gelb  whisper-croaks, "Reinventing the unending day/in high isolation,"  you feel his protagonist's buzz of happy futility. Sure, think Tom Waits.  Think Yo La Tengo. Think Lou Reed. Hell, think Leonard Cohen or Neil Young  (circa "On the Beach.")if you want. Think all of them, then  throw it all away, because Giant Sand practically reinvents pop minimalism.  Just let the beauty, sadness and mystery of "Chore" envelop you.  (I'm not much for serendipity, but how else do you attribute the nearly  coincidental arrival of "Chore of Enchantment" with the Mekon's  equally forlorn but illuminating "Journey to the End of  Night"?) Gelb and his crew have endowed us with something special  and something stunning -- spiritual desolation has rarely sounded so lush  and so damn true to the heart.
