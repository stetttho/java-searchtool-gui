 Uncle Tupelo occupies a special place in my heart, with a strange and intoxicating songbook that owes to seemingly every source that came before it -- from punk and grunge to roots and folk -- and yet somehow foretells  our future. March 16-20 has the sound,smell and feel of the great  Appalachian artists unearthed by Harry Smith in the 1950s and rightfully  characterized by Greil Marcus as part of "the other, weird  America." It was Marcus who posited "The Basement Tapes" as  a stunning, timeless consequence of roots music that has cast a long shadow  on our native musical vernacular. I feel the same way today about Uncle  Tupelo in general, and March 16-20 in particular. UT mines the same  territory that Dylan and the Band did, albeit in an infinitely more somber  and stripped down fashion that often trades the mystery and ambiguity of  "The Basement Tapes" for flat-out fear and loathing. Tweedy's  near apocalyptic interpretation of "Satan Your Kingdom Must Come  Down" strikes the most explicit sense of Biblical doom in a cd that  merges the political, religious and personal, but the whole of March 16-20  seems shrouded in shadows and spookiness. The songs range from poignant UT  originals like "Grindstone" -- a poison dart aimed at brutal  American capitalism --  to traditonal ballads like "Coalminers"  -- another anti-capitalist screed -- to a reworking of the Louivin  Brothers' "Atomic Power." The spare,simple power of March 16-20  is best captured by its title. It seems to me a truly remarkable testament  to the talents of Farrar, Tweedy and the rest of UT that they produced a  document of musical timelessness where guitars, mandolins, banjos,  tambourines and even feedback tell us where we've come from, and scare the  hell out of us for where we might be going.
