 If you like power chords and working class anthems, buy this CD.  If you don't, well...go read some insipid biography of Shrub Bush, who's sticking it to the very people from whence DKM has sprung.   "Sing Loud, Sing Proud" pulsates with punk energy and a huge heart.  Leave it to DKM to breathe startling new life into the old union fight song "Which Side Are You On?"  Pete Seeger it ain't, but take it from this union man: "Sing Loud, Sing Proud!" is some of the best money you will spend this year.
