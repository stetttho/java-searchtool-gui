 Homeworld is the best space sim I've seen. The interface is pretty straight forward, the tutorials are very well done, the plot is excellent, and the playability is awesome. The only reason I gave it 4 stars (4 1/2 really) are the graphics are not "up to par" with today's graphics but this was released in 99 so no big deal. It's not that the graphics are BAD, they are awesome. But compared to today's quake engine, it's not as good. But you will hardly notice because the game play is EXCELLENT! You really feel like you are in space and commanding your own fleet. And I haven't even tried the multiplayer game yet which has got to be wild! The Game of the Year edition comes with the Prima Guide and the music CD so you basically get the game for FREE!!! You can't lose!
