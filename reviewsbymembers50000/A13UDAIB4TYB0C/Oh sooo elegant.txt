 ...like everything else Apple develops. This is simply the best MP3 player out there. One reviewer (and only one) suggested it sounded horrible. I submit, judging by the comments, the user is probably using 48k MP3s ;) The sound of my 128K (or higher) MP3s is nothing short of incredible. Another reviewer stated this was the best MP3 player a Mac user could own. Although I feel sorry for peecee users there is some relief here: There is free software out there that allows a peecee to use an iPod. But Windoze owners beware: you won't find the familiar crashes or confusing interfaces that you are accustomed to. What you will find is an MP3 so simple to use that the instruction manual was a brochure! And I was using the device intuitively w/o the manual. And if you think the iPod is easy to use and elegant, try a Mac with OS X!!!
