 Up to this album I have absolutely loved Iona's music. They had a perfect mix of Rock and Celtic. On this album, almost every song has a screeching lead guitar overwhelming the rest of the music. I finally had to shut it off as it was like fingernails on a chalkboard! I hope they return to their roots. They are wonderfully talented musicians.
