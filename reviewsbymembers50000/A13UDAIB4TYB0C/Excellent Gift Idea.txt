 I wonder if the other reviewer actually read the agreement with the gift card: Apple does not take an extra 15 cents. It stays in your account and as you acquire more gift cards it accumulates. Up to two years if memory serves.  Anyway my daughter LOVES getting the cards. In fact she came to me to ask about doing chores to get iTunes. I gave her a list of chores and before she finished them I had her gift certificate printed out.  And gift shopping doesn't get any easier than this when you have a music lover recipient! You can email a gift certificate as well so you don't even have to pay for shipping!
