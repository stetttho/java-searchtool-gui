 I recently discovered The Corrs when a friend gave me the "Talk On Corners" CD. I liked it so much I immediately ordered everything they've produced. "Forgiven, Not Forgotten" is my favorite. The album has a well-balanced mix of ballad, instrumental, and rock songs. The Corrs have perfected the integration of traditional Celtic music with Pop/Rock. This is the kind of album that you can use the Repeat function on your CD player and not get burnt out. It is that good. If you decide to buy only one album by The Corrs, this is the one you want!  :)
