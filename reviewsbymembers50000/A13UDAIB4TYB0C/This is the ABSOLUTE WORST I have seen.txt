 This is the poorest design I have seen in 20 years of gaming. The interface is extremely confusing. You are moving in one direction until the cut scene then you are moving in the opposite direction. So until you get the hang of it, you're running back and forth between scenes. Most of the attractions will not allow you in until you accumulate enough points for either a cap or an E pass. How do you accumulate points? By picking up garbage and throwing it in trash cans! Wow this is fun! Or collecting letters that make up the name Universal Studios Theme Park. My daughter and I played for about half and hour and finally gave up. It was dull, boring, and frustrating. We had more fun making fun of the game than playing it. I can't believe they actually make you pay for this!!! STAY AWAY unless you want a lesson in how BAD a game can be.
