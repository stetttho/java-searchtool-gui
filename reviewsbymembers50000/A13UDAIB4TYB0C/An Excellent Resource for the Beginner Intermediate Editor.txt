 I'm not sure what book a couple of reviewers were reading but to say this book is not good for beginners seems odd to me. I am an absolute beginner and I thought the book did a fantastic job! It is easy to read and has great examples. One reveiwer said "notice how often he uses the word 'I' and that his way was the only way". Well guess what? The author is one of the designers of the software so I think he qualifies to use the word 'I' and probably knows a lot more about the subject than the reviewer. This insinuation that the author was an ego maniac was insulting. He was very helpful and gave lots of tips and advice to beginners that allows us to avoid some of the common pitfalls and mistakes that most beginners go through. He shows several ways of doing each task but recommends using his technique because that's the way the software was designed to be used! If you want to learn the ins and outs of editing and the most efficient way to use FCP, this is the book for you.
