 I will not recap plot or storyline. I will simply agree with the other reviewers. Sir Anthony Hopkins is very deserving of his title. He is undoubtedly the finest actor today. Emma Thompson is magnificent in this  film. The story, the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the score  are all perfect. This movie demonstrates the ability to thoroughly  entertain without violence or vulgarity.
