 I won't recap all the other reviews. I just wanted to say this DVD is wonderful entertainment. This is one of those movies you want to see at least once a year as a family tradition. Like a Saturday in mid-winter with hot chocolate, freshly-baked chocolate chip cookies and the 10th Kingdom. Doesn't get any better!
