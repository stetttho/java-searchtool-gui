 ...I mean come on: "no crashes in 10 months"? The power of NT is a joke. Oh yeah you don't get the blue screen of death anymore: now you get this cute little dialogue box that says the system is going to shutdown in xx seconds and gives you the opportunity to close your programs. Yeah that's real power alright. I work for IBM and I fight with Windows all day. Nothing CPU-intensive mind you, just IE, Excel, etc. But it's a constant struggle to get anything done because of the lockups and crashes. Macs cost a little more but geez if you consider all the downtime and rework from struggling with Windows, Macs are a bargain. When I get home, I sit down at my Mac (which I never turn off) and enjoy a clean, no-hassle experience. I do videography on the side and am using Final Cut Pro to render movie edits (a real test of how powerful a computer is) while simultaneously checking email, browsing the web, and working in Studio Artist (another CPU workhorse). All without a hiccup. You know why? The Mac OS is built on UNIX, the most powerful and reliable OS in the world.  If Windows users only knew what a wonderful experience Mac offers they would ditch their peecees for good. And now with the latest Mac OS, you can network with a Windows machine and exchange files and data WITHOUT KNOWING A THING ABOUT NETWORKING! Try THAT with a Windows machine. Hey peecees can't even play nice with other Windows machines. When Apple released its latest version of OS X, there were parties and celebrations all over the world. People lining up for hours to get the latest version. Ever seen that with M$ Windows??? The only one I remember was Win95 and Bill Gates paid for the hoopla.  Get a Mac and enjoy yourself or buy XP and kick yourself...
