 Unlike Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers this game actually makes you think. In other words it's not just a button mashing game to get from level to level. Excellent game play. Just the right mix of combat, puzzle-solving and exploring. Great graphics and decent voice acting and nicely follows the book though it does take some liberties. Also I loved the music: very much fits the theme of the game.   Overall a wonderful purchase. The only RPG for the Cube that was better was Zelda: Ocarina of Time.
