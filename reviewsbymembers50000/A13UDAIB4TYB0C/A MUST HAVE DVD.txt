 This DVD demonstrates the effectiveness of the medium for concerts. The audio mix was outstanding and the visuals were stunning. I have never seen Sarah M. in concert but this really felt like being there, especially in  5.1. I really enjoyed the multiangle of Into the Fire focused on Ash the  drummer. I hope this is utilized more often in other concert DVDs. I have  an extensive DVD collection and this is by far the best music DVD to date.  Previously my favorite was Fleetwood Mac but this one is an order of  magnitude better! Wow!
