 San Juan Suite II is Michael Gettel's best album. It captures his style beautifully because it is piano and bass...that's it and that is all it needs. Sandin Wilson provides bass lines that complement rather than detracts from Michael's keyboards. The opening moments of the album on The Calling set the stage for 50+ minutes of pure bliss. Michael begins with a simple piano theme set against the ocean waves and seagulls. Then Sandin joins in and the first notes of his bass will send chills down your spine. Whisper on the Tide is another song that blends the two instruments in a way that tingles the senses. Tale of the Whales is hauntingly beautiful with Michael and Sandin's melodies blended with whale song. Moonrise Over Orcas is mixed with a loon in this quiet and peaceful end to a wonderful album...Buy used if you have to but don't miss this album!  Michael and Sandin, please: Encore!
