 I loved this game! It was thoroughly engaging from beginning to end. It has just the right combination of strategy, action, and humor. I have to laugh at the  earlier reviewer knocking the nudity: the only way to get the nudity is to download a hack that specifically says what it does. Besides it is only partial nudity and was only in the 'mermaid' section of the game and it is tastefully done.
