 The book's back cover states (about the website) " Threaded Discussion List - A forum for you and fellow students to discuss technical topics, WITH ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE FROM AN EXPERT MENTOR."  DON'T BELIEVE IT! The "mentor" rarely checks in. I had a straight  forward question and still have not received an answer 3 days later. And I  saw answers to other questions by students that were obviously wrong yet  were not corrected by the "mentor". The Discussion List is full  of msgs from upset students who were expecting SAMS to deliver what they  promised. The msgs are simply ignored. And the book is full of typos and  errors. Others have reviewed this book and said the same things so how can  they rate it 4 stars?  I highly recommend Just Java 2 by Peter van der  Linden or Beginning Java 2 by Ivar Horton.
