 At first glance I was so mad that Ms. Woods would start another trilogy before releasing the final installment of The Dutch trilogy.  So I was a little hesitant to go there with this book.  But I'm glad that I did.  The Reigns family is like no other found in urban novels.  Damian, Dante, Princess and Dajon didn't grow up deprived in the ghetto then turning to hustling as a means to survive.  The Reigns children grew up with silver spoons in their mouths constantly able to afford the finer things in life.   But what can be worse than Ivy League Criminals????   The Reigns family runs and empire that's controlling the drug trade throughout most of the U.S.  And they run it with an iron grip!!! Deadly Reigns is truly an appropriate title for this family. The effort in which they go after their enemies including each other is shocking. The bodies are quickly pililng up!!!  Including bodies of federal agents who were sent in to bring down the Reigns Empire.  But after several agents turn up missing the FBI turns up the heat by throwing in agent Grace Moore to infiltrate the family.  But agent Moore quickly finds herself in way too deep.   The jaw dropping ending as with all Teri Woods book is not really an ending but the begining of another trilogy that will leave the reader begging for more.  The only question I have is how could you do your fans like this again Ms. Woods????
