 Brandon McCalla is definately taking the urban literary field into a new direction and I'm coming along for the entire ride.  Diamond Drought is a classic that should be catagorized with Coldest Winter Ever, BMore Careful and True to The Game.  Diamond Drought actually transcends urban fiction.   Brandon wrote a Jackie Collins type novel with characters from the Hood.  Even his acknowledgements are blazing when he opened it up with that quote from Foxy Brown..(Let me tell you where I grew up at/sip mo, threw up at/flip coke, blew up at...) I knew then that he was a brother on his grind.   Brandon I'm a fan for life.  Diamond Dynasty, the literary field will never be the same!!!
