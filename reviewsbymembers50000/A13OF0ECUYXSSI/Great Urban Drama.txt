 For a first time author Ms. Santiago definately shines.  Her characters come to life and absorb you into their lives from page 1.  I really enjoyed this book from start to finish and can't wait to read her upcoming release.  (there's an excerpt in the end of this book for it that will have you wide open!) Now I know why Little Ghetto Girl skyrocketed to the top of the Essence Best Seller's list.
