 I read Episode I in this series (PayBack's A Bitch) a while ago, I had the original cover.  Although I liked the book I felt that Mr. Spears didn't give us enough of The Woman Hood.  But I guess episode I provided the background information because in episode II Mr. Spears has stepped his game up with the grimiest caucasian character found between the pages of an urban book, Mende.  Mende's desires for black men are so strong that she's altered her lips, booty and breasts in order to compete with the sistahs and ensure that she'll be able to snare her some thug love.  But when Mende decides to hook up with Riva to steal The Woman Hood's stash she's bitten off way more than she can chew.    Mende was sooooo off the hook that I forgot all about the characters from episode I that I wanted updates on and even forgot all about The Woman Hood clique.   Mr. Spears even turned up the temperature with this one because the sex scenes are like .......WHOA!!!!  Behold A Pale Whore has guaranteed that I'll purchase all the books in this series.
