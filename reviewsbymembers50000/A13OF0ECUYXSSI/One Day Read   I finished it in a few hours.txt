 Ebony Stroman takes you on an enjoyable ride through the hood with characters that you're gonna love.  I was amazed that this was her debut novel, she writes like an established author.  And the excerpt for her upcoming release (The Game Chose Me)had me on the edge of my seat.  I'm looking forward to that book and many many more from Ms. Stroman
