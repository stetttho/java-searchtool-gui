 I picked up this book at the Harlem Book Fair where I had the pleasure of meeting the authors.  I never imagined two innocent looking people could write a tale so grimey.   Ashley & JaQuavis really put it down in their debut novel.  Although I knew that it was two authors writing I could never tell who was writing what or where they switched off at.  The writing flow was just that tight.  I loved the story but the ending had me hotttt!!!!  I'm not going to ruin it for anyone but I know a sequel must be in the works.  Big-ups to Ashley and JaQuavis the streets were buzzing about Dirty Money for a good reason.
