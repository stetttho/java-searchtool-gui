 Allison Hobbs' novel Insatiable centers around two totally opposite women's obsessive love for one man. Marquise Whittset has had his baby mamma Terelle wrapped around his finger since middle school. While incarcerated Marquise and Terelle grow even closer while she plans their future together. In an attempt to keep Marquise from returning to his former lifestyle Terelle gets him a job in the housekeeping department of the nursing home that she works in.   However upon gaining his freedom will Marquise be able to keep all the promises he made to Terelle of a better life for themselves and their young daughter? Not if Kai Montgomery, the psychotic social worker, who is also employed at the nursing home has anything to do with it. Kai Montgomery is beautiful, wealthy and mentally unstable. Some of the book's most memorable moments comes while Kai dispels misery upon anyone who crosses her path.   It was very clear as to why Kai became so obsessed with Marquise but I was truly disappointed to see Terelle lose her sanity behind Marquise as well. Terelle was so blinded by her hopes for a family life with Marquise that she chose to ignore the obvious signs of his infidelity. But when Marquise starts sleeping with Kai the ensuing love triangle becomes deadly.  Insatiable was an excellent read providing the perfect reasons as to why you should never love another more than you love yourself
