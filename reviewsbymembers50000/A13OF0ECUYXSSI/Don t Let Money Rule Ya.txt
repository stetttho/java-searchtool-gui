 Portia Lane is tired of using what she got to get what she wants.  At 25 she's ready to give up stripping and become a regular 9 to 5 girl like her friends Lalia, Simone and Fatima.  She has a degree in accounting and a good head on her shoulders so it shouldn't be too hard.  But life is always hard especially when trying to win the heart of a man who met you while dancing as Mystique.  In the begining of this book I detested Portia's character for a costly mistake that she made while chasing that almighty dollar.  Giving full credit to Caroline McGill's writing style she made me do a full 360 and root for a character that I swore I'd hate.  This book is simply remarkable!!!  It's African- American Contemporary Fiction at it's best and it's difficult to believe that this is Ms. McGill's first book.  A Dollar Outta Fifteen Cents made me laugh out loud and shed plenty of tears.  When I got 20 pages from the end of the book I actually closed it because I didn't want the story to end.  After I picked it back up and read the final pages I decided not to pick up another book for a couple of days so I could remain a little longer in the environment that Ms. McGill so skillfully crafted.
