 Thomas Long takes readers into a look into the life of Dayvon a young hustler who finally realizes he wants out of the game.  But there is no easy way out when you are the sole head of DFL Baltimore's most notorious drug orginization. Dayvon's partner Ty is currently incarcerated and he doesn't take Dayvon's impeding departure well. What ensues next will have readers flipping the pages untill they reach the climatic end.  I don't want to give anything away but my favorite part of the book is the way in which Mr. Long deals with Dayvon's promiscuity.  Very few authors like to address the realities of unprotected sex with multiple partners. But this book has this and much much more.  They are many unexpected twists and turns you'll be hooked from the start.  Mr. Long has made me a believer with this novel and has made his way into my top 5 male authors with the likes of Al Saadiq Banks & K'wan Foye.
