 In her debut novel Amaleka McCall spins a tale that most seasoned authors couldn't re-create.  Both Myra & Milton have horrific childhoods that leave them both emotionally scarred.  When meeting at St. John's College you would think that two tortured souls could really share something special.  Unfortunately the past haunts the present through Milton which only continues the suffering for young Myra.  Ms. McCall snatches you in from the opening page and never lets go.  The book alternates back and forth from the past to the present leaving readers anxious to find out how things went so horribly wrong.  There were an abundance of antagonists that readers will love to hate in this one Vidal, Bertha, Quincy, Scriggy and Knowledge.  Ms. McCall even had me hating on the handicapped with Cisco.  Ms. McCall you did your thing with this book.  A Twisted Tale of Karma has made a fan out of me!!!!!
