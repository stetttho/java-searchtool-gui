 As everyone can see I'm still playing catch up with Mr. Jones' books and even though I'm reading them out of order I'm nonetheless still enjoying every minute of it.  In Ride or Die, Mr. Jones introduces us to Keisha and Jamal two lovers on the run from their fathers, who are sworn enemies and from the police who somehow think that Jamal is responsible for the Police Commissioner's murder.    This story jumps right off the pages as Jamal attempts to elude the entire Philadelphia police force with only the help of his boo Keisha who proves that she knows the true definition of Ride or Die.    Ride or Die is full of unexpected plot twists which really drives this story and will keep readers on the edge of their seats until it reaches it's shocking conclusion.
