 While reading the review posted by Radiah Hubbert from Urban-Reviews.com, I just had to say that I co-sign 100% with everything you posted.  I couldn't put it any better but I just had to post so I could give Mr. Foye that other 1/2 star you left off.  It's no secret that I'm a fan of K'wan's work.  But he just keeps getting better and better.  He kicked down the door with Gangsta.  You would think it couldn't get much better than that hood classic but he has shown nothing but growth since then.  Road Dawgs, Street Dreams and now Hoodlum is providing a legacy that will remain for years to come.    I know all the K'wan fans like myself have already read this one.  But for all of you who haven't read anything by K'wan please pick up this book and afterwards I promise that you'll purchase everything ever written by him. Kwan Foye is like fine wine he just keeps getting better with time!!!!!!
