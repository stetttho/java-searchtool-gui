 Mr. McCalla's hip-hop soap opera picks right up where it left off. Shantel is disguising herself as Toya in an effort to get closer to Rich's girl Leaya.   Major who is now cohabitating with Sparkles is busting shots off at Afta while making the ave red hot for Red October.  If none of these characters sound familiar than you obviously missed out on one of the hottest boooks of 2004, Diamond Drought.  Part II Diamond Dynasty does not disapoint. Finally a sequel that answers all the unanswered questions of it's predecessor.  Not only are secrets revealed but loyalties are crossed.    Mr. McCalla also expands the roles of some of the smaller cast members from book one.  The block hugger Red October and my personal favorite Afta's gun wielding baby-momma Destiny both have more time to shine in part II.    Books one and two alone of the Diamond Series prove that this author is destined for greatness.  I wouldn't be surprised to see this book on a big screen in the near future.  It definitely jumps off the pages in true cinematic form.
