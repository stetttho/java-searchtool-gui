 Around The Way Girls 2 easily surpasses it's predecessor.  I'm not a fan of short stories but when I saw which authors contributed to this book, my prefrences quickly took a back seat.  Kashamba Williams, Thomas Long and Lajill Hunt all have novels that I've enjoyed so I knew that this combination could not dissapoint.  Each short story contained characters that will not easily be forgotten.    Juicy Brown ~ Juicy easily wins the Ghetto Queen Crown.  Which she wears with no shame.  Juicy will stop at nothing to keep her family together and achieve Hood Rich status.    Prescious Payne ~ Can a young girl escape a tragic childhood without being permanently scarred? Prescious has a chip on her shoulder and revenge in her heart as she attempts to do so.   Lyric Crenshaw ~ Lyric has game which she freely shares with her co-worker Alicia.  Unfortunately Alicia learns the lesson a little to well.  When Lyric falls for Alicia's brother Jeremiah can she convince Alicia to change her game in the 9th inning?   Each story was well written leaving me wishing that they each could have been full legnth novels. Now I remember why I didn't like short stories in the 1rst place.
