 Treasure Blues' writing is very reminiscent of Doanld Goines. I read the book and was suprised that Treasure was a male.  Especially the way he was able to capture the female experience.  I also loved the image he portrayed of Silver's mother. He displayed a new level of understanding for people addicted to drugs and their struugle to overcome their demons.
