 Solomon Jones delivers big time in his crime drama Pipe Dream.  Four innocent crack heads suspected of killing a politician attempt to outrun their demons along with the Philadelphia Police Department.  Solomon Jones spins a crime novel reminiscent of James Patterson with characters from the hood that urban readers will enjoy rooting for.  I'm sorry that it took me this long to discover Mr. Jones' talent but I plan on making up for lost time.   Mr. Jones you just gained a new fan!!!!
