 With Block Party being my all time favorite urban book my expectations for Block Party 2 were extremely high. But leave it to Al Saadiq Banks to actually surpass my expectations. My entire desire for Block Party 2 was based on my need for Cashmere's real killer to be revealed to his loved ones. In Sincerely Yours readers learned that everyone including the police thought that the Mayor was responsible for Cashmere's murder. This was the wrong that I so desperately needed to be righted in Block Party 2!  In Block Party 2 readers get to see just how Cashmere's death effected everyone but especially the loss felt by his two sons Ahmir and Ahmad. Ahmad has heeded his father's advice and is focused on school and basketball however Ahmir's only focus is the streets and by 17 he has definitely earned his street name "Young Cash". Young Cash is truly living reckless in his mind he's even surpassed his father's hustling status. But at what cost?  A very high cost when you take into effect that Young Cash evolves into the top lieutenant of his own father's killer. Will Young Cash forsake his freedom, family and even his own life by unknowingly aligning himself with the man who murdered his father? The answer to that question can only be found between the pages of Block Party 2.   All sequels should be this good!!!! All the familiar characters are here (Slim, Desire, Love, Nephew The Mayor & Suave) along with a few new ones that readers will grow to love (The Bookkeeper, Bucky & Mu-Mit) But what makes Block Party 2 a winner is what's found in all True2Life publications, realism. And what Al Saadiq Banks proves in this his 5th novel is the same thing that makes him my favorite author, consistency!!!
