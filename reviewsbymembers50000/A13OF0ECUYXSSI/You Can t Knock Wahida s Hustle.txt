    Wahida Clark is back with a banger!!! All Wahida's fans know that Payback is a Mutha was originally titled Don't Knock The Hustle but it's release took so long that another author utilized that title. But please believe that even with a different title Payback is still All That!!!!   Payback follows two best friends Brianna and Shan whose attitudes on life are totally different. Both women are dime pieces but Brianna manipulates men to get ahead while Shan would rather earn an honest living. Through it all their friendship remain strong until one of Brianna's hustles places both girl's backs up against the wall.   Brianna's trickery causes a domino effect that not even she can withstand, forcing Shan to become a player in a game she usually watched from the side lines. While Brianna finally sees the wrong in her actions but not before having to deal with Payback in it's most brutal form.   Payback is a Mutha is full of deceit, treachery, sex, murder and mayhem and is sure to place Ms. Clark back on The Essence Best Seller's List where she belongs!!!
