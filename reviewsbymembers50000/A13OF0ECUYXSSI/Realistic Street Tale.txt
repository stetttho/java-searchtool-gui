 With some many author's glamorizing the life of a hustler it was refreshing to read Kwan's latest book Street Dreams.  His characters were honest people put in difficult situations that were forced to make difficult, life altering choices.  I loved the way he didn't glorify the drug game.  His characters weren't flossing in expensive cars they were just surviving their day to day struggles.  Which is much far more realistic image of people involved in drug dealing.  This book is a MUST read for anyone who loves reading "realistic" urban fiction.  And the ending is mind blowing, I'm still in shock.  Excellent work Kwan you never dissapoint!
