 Knockin' Boots chronicles the lives of Kevin Lawson and Emile Pinchback two foster brothers who are both stationed at Fort Dix in New Jersey. Both brothers suffer from serious problems due to the abuse of their foster mother Dirty Sue and her two daughters Lil Mama and Teesha.  Dirty Sue and her daughters ridiculed young Emile about his weight and the color of his skin and turned him into their personal slave. But their abuse of Kevin who was a pretty boy was far worse. They used him as a sex slave giving him two cases of the drips and one dose of chlamydia all by the time he was in the 7th grade. Needless to say both Emile and Kevin have serious issues by the time they reach adulthood.  Emile has a hatred of black women and of his own dark skin and now as an adult he can only find beauty in white women (Becky Ann). Kevin has become an sex addict who manipulates his wife (Fancy) into participating in his dirty little games to satisfy his perverted urges.  Fancy has been painted as the base whore because of all the traffic leading in & out of her house but unbeknownst to everyone she's just soliciting partners for her husband. Once Fancy finally decides that enough is enough the book spirals to an explosive conclusion. Kudos to Mrs. Price-Thompson for delving into the taboo subject of sexual addiction and all of it's consequences.
