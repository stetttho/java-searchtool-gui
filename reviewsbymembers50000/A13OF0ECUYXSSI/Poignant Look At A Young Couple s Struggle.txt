 Natasha and Antoinio's words will speak to you long after you close the final page of this book.  I never thought that a story told in the form of letters could be so enthralling but I couldn't go to sleep until I found out the outcome of this story.  The lives of these characters evolve in the letters as they endure heartache, disappointment and struggle.  A sixteen year old boy incarcerated with grown men while his fifteen year old girlfriend struggles to stand by him.  Can young love survive such adversity?    After finishing this book I felt as if I did the bid with Antonio and I was more than happy to have seen him through his darkest hours and trust me you will be too. Upstate is the best book I've read since I cracked open The Color Purple.  Ms. Buckhanon has a true gem on her hands.
