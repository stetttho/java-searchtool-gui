 While reading the reviews I see that a lot of people didn't enjoy Candy Licker stating that the plot was too similar to G-Spot.  My advice to Noire is to keep doing what you do best Ma-Ma. If Stephen King can be the king of Horror then Noire can be the Queen of Urban Erotica.  And she's wearing her title well!!!  If you loved G-Spot then please believe your gonna love Candy Licker.  Noire is back giving her fans exactly what they want and need !!!!
