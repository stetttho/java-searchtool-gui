 All the Nay Sayers who believe that urban lit has nothing to offer the literary world need only to pick up this book to find out why urban lit is here to stay.  All those who are convinced that only stereotypical images of sex and violence is all that's to be found inside of an urban book needs to be introduced to author Leo Sullivan and immersed in the masterful tale he penned with his debut novel Life.  Life is no ordinary urban tale even though it contains all the necessary elements.   A thugged out main character (Life Thugstin), a brainy heroine (Hope Evans), a murderous drug lieutenant (Blazack), a dirty cop (Spitler) and a crew of dangerous females (Trina, Evette & Tomica) whom readers will be kept guessing as to with whom their loyalties lie.   One of the many reasons that Life resonates above the rest of urban lit is the character development.  Every character contained in the novel even minor characters like strung out Nina Brown get blessed with Mr. Sullivan's descriptive flair of storytelling.   A flair so great that Mr. Sullivan easily brings to life the fear of a hustler trying to survive a game where there are no winners, or the desperation of a woman determined to pull her man out of a game that she introduces him to and the desperation of yet another woman frantically trying to save all black men in the court room from the injustice of a corrupt legal system.  Including a drug kingpin who's facing a life sentence.  A man whose child she bore years ago without his knowledge.    Leo Sullivan delivers a clear message to the doubters of urban lit but better than that his book Life delivers to fans of the genre a new urban masterpiece!!!!!!  Congratulations Mr. Sullivan excellent work!!
