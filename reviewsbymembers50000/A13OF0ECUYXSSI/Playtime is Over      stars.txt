 To be totally honest the cover almost kept me away from this book and once I purchased it I thought it did start off kind of slow.  But then new author Brandie picked up the ball that I thought she was about to fumble and marched this book down field and right into scoring position.    Four friends (Chocolate, Money, Taeko & Luvly) graduate High School and all lead successful lives.  Two professional athletes, one male model and a business owner.  But the success doesn't come without the drama and that's what kept me turning the pages of this book.   The Luvly, Money & Diamond love triangle will keep readers glued to the pages.  Diamond was a true S.O.B that was so brutal that he deserves his own book just to see what made him do the foul things that he did (Hint-Hint@Brandie).   But the ending of the book is what will leave readers mouths hanging wide open.  I know there must be a part II in the works because I refuse to believe the conclusion to this one.  But all in all Brandie definitely scores with Don't Hate The Player...Hate The Game.
