 Honey Sinclair has just made detective at the 47th precinct in the Bronx.  Which wasn't an easy feat as a sexy, sassy black woman working within the NYPD.  But what makes it even harder than her looks or her mouth is the fact that her father was one of the Bronx's largest Cocaine Kingpins.  Since her father's fall from grace and incarceration Honey decides to go on the straight and narrow and against the grain by becoming 5-0.  But with a sister (Ginger) who's still married to the game can Honey keep work and home separate???    That's not so easy when Honey's first case is a homicide, with a serial killer who has a thing for murdering fly girls.  Fly girls that are looking for ballers to sponsor them.  Fly girls like Honey's sister Ginger and members of her crew.    Author Alan Cramer has shown his duplicity by proving that he can master more than just one genre.  A hood murder mystery, which provides an excellent reprieve from the norm.  The Life is definitely that and much more!!!
