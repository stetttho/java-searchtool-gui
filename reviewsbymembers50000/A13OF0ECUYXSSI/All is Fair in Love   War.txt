 I don't want to ruin the suspense for everyone that has been waiting patiently for the conclusion to Triangle of Sins, but I just have to say that Nat is still a mess.  So many readers were so caught up in Shawn in the first installment of this series that they didn't see all of Natalia's obvious faults.  But I did.   With that said I have to give Nurit credit because I couldn't stand Natalia throughout book one yet I was dying for book two to be released.  Natalia's problem was that she was spoiled and she wanted to have her cake and eat it too.   Marrying Mark while longing for Shawn caused the dilemma that we find all three main characters dealing with at the onset of Rectangle of Sins.   In Rectangle of Sins Natalia finally gets to be with her prince charming but is forced to deal with his infidelity and decides that two can play that game.  As they go tit for tat readers will realize that these two really belong together but can Shawn and Natalia realize it before too much damage is done.  That depends on what your idea of too much damage is.  I enjoyed Triangle of Sins more but Rectangle of Sins is a must read for anyone that read the first book.  Rectangle of Sins  manages to answers all the questions from it's predecessor and proves that not all endings are happy ones.
