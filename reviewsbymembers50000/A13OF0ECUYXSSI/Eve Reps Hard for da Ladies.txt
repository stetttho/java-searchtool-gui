 K'wan fans know exactly how he puts it down with his pen especially with so many hard hitting novels like Gangsta, Road Dawgz, Street Dreams and Hoodlum all under his belt.  Almost all of K'wan books contain a strong female character but with his newest book Eve the main character (Eve Panelli) is female and she's holding it down!!!     Eve's parents were killed when she was just 9 and by 17 Eve is the leader of the all girl Twenty-Gang.  After serving an 18 month sentence Eve hits the streets hard determined to get hers.  With stick-up skills obtained through none other than Harlem's finest, Bullet, Eve is ready to get back on her grind.  But when her best friend Cassidy is murdered Eve is forced to go up against a powerful mob family to avenge her friend's death.  With Eve K'wan masterfully pens a tale about a crafty, street smart female who's totally able to hold her own when her back is against the wall.
