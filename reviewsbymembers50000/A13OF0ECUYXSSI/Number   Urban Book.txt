 I'm almost at a loss for words to describe just how good this book is.  I've read all of Mr. Banks books but this one is my personal favorite. I have to say that it actually surpassed The Coldest Winter Ever which had been my all time favorite urban novel.  Mr. Banks never dissapoints and none of his book endings are ever predictable.  Mr. Banks is a sure bet!! I would read a cookbook if he wrote it. He's just that good...Need I say AnyMore?
