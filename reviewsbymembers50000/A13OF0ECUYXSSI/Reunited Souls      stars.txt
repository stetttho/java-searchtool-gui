 Joylynn Jossel has finally returned to give her fans the conclusion to The Root of All Evil with it's long anticipated sequel When Souls Mates. Readers of the first book will remember that the main character Klarke made the ultimate sacrifice confessing to a crime she didn't commit to protect her daughter. Now that the truth comes out Klarke is released from prison four years later and attempts to put the pieces of her life back together.   Joylynn masterly weaves the story together so that even if you hadn't read the first book you could still follow along and be truly entertained. I especially loved the growth of the characters, Breezy and Jeva in particular. But all through the book readers will be rooting for Klarke and Reo to re-unite, the title suggests that they will but a lot has happened in four years and nothing worth having is ever easily attained.  When Souls Mate is a drama filled roller coaster ride. The only reason I took away a 1/2 star is that I did wish that more time was spent with Klarke and Reo once they finally reconciled. And there was a major secret revealed to readers and the book ended without it coming out. But all that withstanding When Souls Mate is an excellent read and an extraordinary sequel.
