 It was truly a refreshing experience to read an urban tale with a new twist. Sidi chronicles the life of an innocent African girl (Fatou) who's American dream turns into an American nightmare. 12 year old Fatou an African immigrant believes that she's being sent to America to further her education but unbeknownst to her she was sent to America to be the wife of a man almost 4 times her age.   Upon arriving to America Fatou was kept in a Harlem Brownstone forced to submit herself to a man she detested. Afterwards she was let out only to braid hair in an African Hair Braiding store for pennies. But upon meeting David a young Jamaican drug lord will Fatou's life change for the better?  Only if a life of crime could be considered better. David boosts Fatou's self esteem and creates an individual too strong for even him to control. The mean streets of N.Y. only further destroys the innocence of Fatou as she takes back her life and begins a new life of crime with David by her side.   The urban part of this book was very predictable but seeing America from the eyes of a frightened young girl with no voice made Fatou: An African Girl in Harlem an above average read.
