 With so many urban love stories in today's market this book was a refreshing stray from the norm.  Instead of the typical girl meets boy, boy become incarcerated and girl struggles without him this book delves into the story in a totaly different fashion. Ms. Brown's portrayal of a young girl's family life from the opening pages is like no other.    This is a book that I happily recommended to my 16 year old sister for there were many positive messages to be gained.  Messages that usually get lost in todays urban books that sensationalize street life. Black is a great read. Trust me you won't be dissapointed and you will need to have the kleanex near by.
