 Mr. Imes introduces us to Second the youngest of 4 brothers who just suffered the death of his mother.  Second has a prison record, a young daughter, a baby mother, a possible baby mother, a wild best friend named Allen and enough drama in his life to keep you turning the pages.  I truly enjoyed Mr. Imes portrayal of a young black man struggling to do the right thing .  I look forward to reading more from this up & coming literary talent.
