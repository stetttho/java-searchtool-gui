 Ok by now you know the premise four friends take swinging to a new level by throwing a key party. Even the most conservative reader like myself will be curious to see what happens when four couples voluntarily decide to swap mates for one night of passion. And what ensues was much much more than what I expected so kudos to the authors for providing an entirely new spin to a seemingly predictable tale.   But what took away from my enjoyment was the way in which the ends to this story were left loose. All the couples experience a dramatic change after partaking in the key party but the two couples who I was most caught up in, fates were left blowing in the wind. I don't want to ruin the read for anyone but I need closure and I'm going to patiently wait for it. Until then where do I leave my key????
