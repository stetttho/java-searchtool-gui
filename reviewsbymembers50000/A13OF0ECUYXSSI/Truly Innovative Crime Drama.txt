 Kudos to Kaven L. Brown for his debut novel Two Face.  A gritty portrayal of drugs, crime and the mafia.  Mr. Brown holds no punches in this fast paced novel which chronichles the attempt of one female attorney (Sam Sharky) and two ruthless cubans ( Cache & Eto) to go against one of New York's most notorious crime families.   This novel stretches form New York, through Miami and on to Cuba as readers will be pulled into rooting for the underdog.  I especially loved the way Mr. Brown was unafraid to kill off main characters.  I'm still mourning the death of two of my personal favorites.  I'm eagerly anticipating the sequel, Two Face: Vengeance. And any other novels from this new literary talent.
