 When I initially saw the cover of this book I thought that this was Christian Literature.  Not that I have a problem with christian lit but I tend to enjoy urban and contemporary African American Lit.  So with that being said the cover and the book title lead me to believe that this might not be the book for me.  However I was in for a pleasant surprise. I'm usually reading urban books told from the standpoint of the drug dealer.  This time I was able to view the story from the viewpoint of the addict with Marcus Dupree.  Marcus was no regualr drug addict this was a college educated black man with a law degree who was bringing in big dollars to his company.  This was a young man with a good head on his shoulders who's only bad habit was smoking weed.  However when Marcus tries his first blunt with a little freebase in it his entire world begins to spiral downwards.  He's able to kep up appearances but his struggle will keep readers glued to the pages.  Not to mention that he gets his wife strung out as well.  And Monique is chasing those pipe dreams much much harder than Marcus.    I took this book to the doctor's office as a way to pass time and was quickly caught up and had to find out the outcome before I went to bed that night.  Alan Cramer did an excellent job of providing readers insight into a world they usually only see from one standpoint.  Excellent work Mr. Cramer and I can't wait to read Good Bless The Child and the continuing struggle of the Dupree family.
