 In the acknowledgements for Mr. Banks fourth novel (Caught 'Em Slippin') he states that a few people thought he went soft with the release of Sincerely Yours?  I'm happy to say that I wasn't one of those few.  Sincerely Yours was written for his female fan base but as one of Mr. Banks' most vocal female fans I have to say that Caught 'Em Slippin' appeals much more to my feminine side. My feminine side demands grittiness from my favorite urban author and Mr. Banks delivers that and much much more.  In Caught "Em Slippin' Mr. Banks introduces readers to Miranda Benderas who is one of the most ride or die chicks found in between the pages of a book.  Miranda's love for Sha-Rock leads her into a world filled with both glamour and murder.  After an incarceration Sha-Rock has big plans for a come up and Miranda is the star player on his team.  Another unforgettable character on his team is Killer Cal, whose name speaks for itself. But even with an unstoppable team how long can the run last?  Long enough to have readers up all night while the book unravels into it's mind-blowing conclusion.    Mr. Banks has even managed to out-do himself with this novel which I thought was impossible.  But nothing is impossible when it's coming from the mind of urban fiction's most talented author.    Excellent work Mr. Banks, From a Fan 4 Life.
