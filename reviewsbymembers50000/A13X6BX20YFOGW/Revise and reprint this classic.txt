 This was Dr. Friedman's first commercially published book.  Compared to some later works it is more concise, has a broader focus, but it is one of the most valuable works ever published.  It gives the explanations and reasons for why battleships were built the way they were -what drove the design tradeoffs - and how different navies emphasized different parameters.  It also has an excellent photo selection that well illustrates each section, and a set of useful data tables.  The only flaw is that as Friedman's earliest commercial work, it is less thoroughly footnoted than some of his later productions.  This is one of the most highly recommended books possible for those seriously interested in the technology of the XXth century 'dreadnought' battleship.
