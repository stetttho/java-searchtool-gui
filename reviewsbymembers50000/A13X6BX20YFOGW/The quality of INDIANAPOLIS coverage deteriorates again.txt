 This book has only one strength - interviews.  Other than that the research quality leaves a lot to be desired.  I leafed through it and discovered only very minimal coverage of Captain McVay's court-martial, with no analysis of the validity, such as is offered in _All the Drowned Sailors_ or _Fatal Voyage_; and I slammed the book down in disgust when I read that the Japanese submarine which sank the INDIANAPOLIS had a seaplane (although built with one, the seaplane, catapult and hangar were removed early in 1945 when the submarine was given the capacity to carry two more "kaiten" weapons) and even worse, a statement that the submarine was armed with a machine guns "to rake survivors on the surface".   How about for anti-air defense and for use against weak surface targets - the same reasons US subs carried them?  Go buy _Abandon Ship_, recently re-issued, Richard Newcomb's book on the sinking of the INDIANAPOLIS - it is the one the survivors I have talked to, think is still best - and don't waste your money on this sub-par volume.  And quit advertising this as "coverage of a nearly forgotten event" - with a made-for-TV movie a few years ago, and the recent efforts to clear McVay's record, and mention in _Jaws_, this is one of the few WWII events most people might remember when asked!
