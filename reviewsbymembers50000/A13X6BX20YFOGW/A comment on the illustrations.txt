 It has been pointed out that one of the illustrations shows a vessel with a ring above the pilot house that looks for all the world like an old fashioned radio direction finding aerial - in a world where radio was still 3 decades in the future.  An actual photo of the vessel has been found and it was discovered that the actual item in that location was a pair of decorative antlers.... Caveat emptor!
