 This book is very disturbing, because of the implied claims contained therein.  It appears that Cussler is attempting to give his organization NUMA credit for the discovery of several wrecks (viz. the table in the  back) whose location has actually been known for years, or likewise to  claim NUMA conducted wreck surveys that were actually done by governments  or other organizations  not related to NUMA.  Glaring examples are the  mention and photos of the wreck of INVINCIBLE, sunk in the battle of  Jutland.  In fact the Royal Navy located the wreck within two years after  the end of WWI in order to reconcile the British and German navigational  logs and track charts of the battle; the British and German governments  commissioned the 1991 wreck survey.  Even more intriguing, the table at the  back asserts that the wreck of the WARATAH, which disappeared off South  Africa in 1909 has been found, but this find, which would solve one of the  greatest mysteries of the sea, has received almost no publicity despite a  recent update release that says exploration has confirmed the identity of a  suspected wreck as the WARATAH.  But why include the wreck in the list as  if it was confirmed, when the confirmation only came two years after  publication of the book?  Misleading, to say the least.
