 There was a lot of flak about _U-571_ because that movie fictionalizes the seizure of an ENIGMA machine from a U-boat... combining two real events involving BRITISH sailors and ships (the capture of the U-505 being almost irrelevant to the ENIGMA story).  No (previous) reviewer had mentioned that _The Enemy Below_ is based on a novel of the same name ... involving a BRITISH destroyer hunting a U-boat.  The movie tracks very well with that novel, other than some cultural changes for the US crew of the US ship. Therefore I think that Leonard Maltin may have it wrong when he says this is essentially a remake of a 1930's movie.  I believe it really is an Americanization of the (early 1950s) British novel.   Yes, the  (original) _Star Trek_ episode "Balance of Terror" is based on this movie.  Both are gripping and suspenseful, and have memorable moments.
