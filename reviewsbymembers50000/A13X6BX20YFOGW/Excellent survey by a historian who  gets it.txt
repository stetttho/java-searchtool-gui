 This is the book later republished under the title _Big Fleet Actions_.  It is an excellent overview of the naval battles of Tsushima, Jutland and the Philippine Sea.  While the Jutland section may have been overtaken by new analyses published later, the Philippine Sea section is a major account of this battle which is somewhat neglected in comparison with Leyte Gulf, 4 months later.  Particularly illuminating is Grove's use of the battle to effectively demolish criticisms of aircraft carriers as "having half their aircraft devoted to self defense" by pointing out that the success of the US fighters in destroying the rebuilt Japanese carrier air force was a decisive victory in and of itself.  Much better than Keegan's foray into naval history.
