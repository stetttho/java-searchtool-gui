 _Roads_ is the best Christmas story since the original one.  Had I been the first reviewer, I would have only given clues toward the ending, where Klaus the Barbarian becomes Claus the good, because it is meant as a surprise ending.  But this is a book I wish I could read in a church Christmas festival to show doubters how "Santa" - St Nicholas, who even if he wasn't real, should have been - is a symbol of Christ, and good; loving, giving and caring, not an anagram of "Satan". Even if you cannot afford the Arkham edition, it was republished in a paperback collection of the _Best of Weird Tales_, and may be again someday.  This story deserves the same kind of wide renown and affection as  Richard Paul Evans' _The Christmas Box_ and O. Henry's "The Gift of the Magi".  Rankin-Bass's animation is cute, but this is the kind of fiction that ought to be true.... Santa SHOULD be real, and this SHOULD be his story.
