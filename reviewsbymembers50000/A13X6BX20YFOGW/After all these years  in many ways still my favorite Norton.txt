 This book combines some of the great SF/Fantasy themes in a way that works and flows.  It is the Norton that I would most frequently check out of the library to re-read as a young adult.  Some of the mental images I developed in reading this story, can still bubble up in my memory today.  The sense of alienation - of not belonging  - felt by the main character echoes the feelings of all unpopular-due-to-nerdiness kids - many of whom were SF fans in the making.  That alone should explain part of its appeal. We also get -  *a cold wintry planet with a Forerunner-like mystery *one of the friendliest and most interesting of Norton's Zacathan characters [a wise, peaceful lizard-evolved race (in sharp contrast to most authors' intelligent-lizards-are-savage depictions (although see Norton's *Eye of the Monster*)] *a hidden, "furry" race *Norton's trademarked handling of telepathy, with her concept since copied by many other authors *and a plot that , while a classic hero's journey, has many particular 'vignettes' that have also been copied since - including by Norton herself - but rarely as well done. All in all, my sentimental favorite of early Nortons, and still fondly remembered. -Brooks A Rowlett
