 For a book rich in trivia, as other reviewers write, there are some surprising errors. MUTSU blew up in Hiroshima Bay, not in Hong Kong!  I buy everything by Dunnigan, even though I acknowledge that his stuff is sometimes flawed. This book, however, I got rid of.  Likely to have reliability problems and errors that I cannot spot as easily as that one. Also, too much re-hashing of things that were in others of Dunnigan's books.
