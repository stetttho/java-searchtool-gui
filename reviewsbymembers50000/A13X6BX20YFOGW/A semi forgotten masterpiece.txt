 The Face in the Frost is a semi-forgotten masterpiece of fantasy/magic.  It is, as the other reviewers have noted, a novel of slowly building creepiness and suspense - skilfully done without going for the gross-out.   There are many fascinating subtleties worked into descriptions, as well -  clever enough that you often go past them, and only on re-reading do you  catch the skill in construction.  A fine sense of tension and danger is  steadily built up, and the climax is  most interesting for being something  of a mental duel versus some action-packed "magic-wand-  fireball-blasting-shoot'em-up". It has been claimed (by the  designers!) that the magic system of the Dungeons & Dragons (TM)  Roleplaying Game is based on use of magic in this book's universe, but that  is far from obvious.  This book clearly can stand on its own, and deserves  reprinting and publicity as an adult fantasy masterpiece.  Other authors,  such as Diane Duane, have also commented on the strengths of this book and  its influence on their own work, and have incorporated subtle references to  it in some of their published books. This is a book to read slowly and  savor.
