 Geez!  Who let this kid out?!  His music is horrible, and he sings songs that he shouldn't even be singing at his age!  He's singing about girls and throwing "wild parties"!  He's still really young and his songs are completely not suited for him...although there are a few that you can tell his age by, but it's just a waste of money.  He should leave the singing for older bro Nick (of the Backstreet Boys).  He also does covers of "I Want Candy" and "Iko Iko" and as an older person, I prefer the originals that to hear them sound terrible sung by Aaron.  His voice hasn't quite matured yet, and he just sounds like the little kid he is, so he should stick to more kiddie songs than songs about girls.
