 It seems that nowadays, there are more and more boy bands, but not too many girl groups.  Atomic Kitten is a fantastic girl group, who don't get enough credit for being awesome and talented.  I loved this album and the songs on it are very poppy and danceable.  My favourite song on it is follow me just because it's mello-like yet poppy at the same time.  It's worth buying if you like pop and are getting sick of the boy bands!
