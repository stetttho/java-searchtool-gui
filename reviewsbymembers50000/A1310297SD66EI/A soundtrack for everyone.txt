 After seeing the movie, I became obsessed with anything having to do with it.  The soundtrack is absolutely amazing-- they gathered so many talented artists and compiled it into one fabulous soundtrack.  I love listening to it.   These Songs... ...will have you getting up and grooving: Blair's "Have Fun Go Mad", Jamiroquai's "Use the Force", Space Monkey's "Drug Soup" ...will have you tapping your feet: Dodgy's "Good Enough", Peach Union's "On My Own", Elton John's "Honky Cat" (no one can have enough Elton), Brand New Heavies' "More Love" ...will have you swaying to the melody:  Amiee Mann's "Amateur"  ...will have you tapping your feet and swaying: Aqua's "Turn Back Time", Dido's "Thank You" (my favourite on the album), Abra Moore's "Don't Feel Like Cryin", Those Magnificent Men's "Call Me A Fool" (an upbeat swaying with a lil' bit of head bobbing) This is a really good album and I totally recommend it cause it's got songs for every mood.
