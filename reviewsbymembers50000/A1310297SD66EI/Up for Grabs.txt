 My favourite songs on this album were definitely the "dance" songs, such as "Bye Bye Bye" (although so much airplay made me tired of it after a while), "It's Gonna Be Me", "Space Cowboy" (feat. TLC's Lisa Lopes), "No Strings Attached", and "Digital Getdown".  Although I don't think 'N Sync should be into the ballads, I have to admit that "This I Promise You" is a very beautiful song.  Once reason why I'm not into this album all that much is cause the songs like "Just Got Paid" and "Makes Me Ill" are just stupid songs.  "I Thought She Knew" was a really bad attempt at a capella.  They can't do it, that's that and they should learn to deal with.  "Digital Get Down" although it was one of my faves, I have to say that I look down on 'N Sync for putting it on their album.  They have fans who are really young and the lyrics to that song and what it talks about isn't something for teeny boppers to listen to.  Even as an older fan, I don't want to listen to them sing about it.  It's not a good message to be giving to the younger fans.  The fast songs with the beats are worth it, but it's really up to you, if you a fan, to decide whether or not to get it.
