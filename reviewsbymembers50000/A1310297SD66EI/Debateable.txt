 I just got this album the other day and I must say, I was a lil' disappointed with it.  I had heard "When You Say Nothing At All" "Life is a Roller Coaster", and "If I don't Tell you Now" and I was expecting the songs to sound more like those.  I'm also a huge Boyzone fan.  This album includes the 3 songs I mention above, but the other tracks aren't too much to boast about.  They're good for backgroud music, but in terms of really getting into it, I found it a tad bit hard.
