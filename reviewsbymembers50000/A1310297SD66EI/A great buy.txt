 I am an absolute fan of Westlife.  You will hear nothing except praise from me about these Irish lads.  Most of their songs are ballads, but what we need nowadays are boy bands who aren't all just dance moves and beats.  These guys sing and your heart goes out to them.  My favourite track on the album is "fool again" because although it's a ballad, it's got a tempo to it that makes you want to sway.  What's great about this CD is that it's got the track "My Private Movie" that's not on the UK version of the album.  It's a really good song because it kinda breaks from their mold of ballad boys to up tempo boys.  it's got an awesome beat, but it's still easy listening.  A worthwhile buy.  You won't regret it!
