 I've been a Celine fan for a while, but this album wasn't as great as I expected it to be.  I really like all the "hits" that she put on the album, but I couldn't find myself enjoying the new 7 songs that she put on it.  It just wasn't my cup of tea, although it was Celine style.  If you like Celine's hits, but not all of her songs, I wouls say that this is a good pick, because I got it only because I wanted all her hits on one album.
