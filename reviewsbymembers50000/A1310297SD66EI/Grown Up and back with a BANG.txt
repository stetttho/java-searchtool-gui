 Hanson's back and they're better than ever.  Switching from their famous "bubble gum pop", they've adapted wider range of genre's.  There's a lil' bit of rock, blues, and everything in between.  My favourite song is track 7, "Can't Stop".  It's fast and up tempo and just fun sounding.  There are slow songs and fast songs.  A more mellow song that I love on this album is track 6 "Dying to Be Alive" which is peaceful and just a good song.  I've always been a Hanson fan, but I started drifting when they didn't release anything, but now I'm back and ready for more dose of Hanson!
