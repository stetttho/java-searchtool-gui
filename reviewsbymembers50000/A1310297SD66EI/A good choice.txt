 This was the first Brit complaition CD that I got and I was overwhelemed by how cool it was.  I found favourites from artists that I love and I even discovered new artists that should be made known about here in the States.  I really love Lene Marlin's "Sitting Down Here" becuase she sounds a lil' like Natalie Imbruglia, but more mellow.  This CD can be pretty surprising.
