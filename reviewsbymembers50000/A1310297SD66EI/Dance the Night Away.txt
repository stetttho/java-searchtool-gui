 If you're a huge fan of SASH! this is THE album to get.  It contains (as it says in the title) his greatest hits.  And the great thing is that it doesn't just have one version of the songs.  It's got some songs that have many different mixes of the same song.  You can never get enough of SASH!  He is just the greates trance DJ of all time, and his songs are fabulous and awesome to bob your head, dance, tap your feet, and just move to.  My favourite songs from the album are "Just Around the Hill", "Mysterious Times" (both a duet with Tina Cousins), and "Adelante" which has an acordian or some thing of that sort in the background.  Awesome album.
