 S Club 7 is back and better than before.  If you enjoyed "S Club 7", then hopefully you'll love "7".  They work in different styles such as R&B and the such.  Brad does quite a bit of rapping, which is a pleasant change.  I really enjoy the song "Natural" cause Rachel sings it, and she's an absolute beauty and her voice is wonderous.  "Stand by You" is done with Hannah and Tina with the lead vocals, and Hannah is my favourite, so I really enjoy this song.  Also, it's got the tune that will stick in your head.  "Reach" is one brilliant song that I've used for many different purposes.  The lyrics really stand out and the message is quite simple...reach for your goals...at least that's the message that I've gotten.  "Love Train" and "Bring the House down" pretty much have the same melody and stuff, but they're both happy-go-lucky songs and "Love Train" has Paul singing the lead, so that's cool.  The other songs are amazing, but the best ones are the ones I mentioned.  I've already owned this album for a few months, but it's still a predominant CD in my player!  Fantastic, and well worth your money!
