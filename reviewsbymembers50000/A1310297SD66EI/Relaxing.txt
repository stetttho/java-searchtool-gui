 This is one of those slow sweet ballads.  These boys sound young and innocent and their voices are just beautiful.  Harmonizing really well, they make it that any girl would want them serenading her.  It's just really sweet and I love listening to it when I'm in a mellow mood or I just feel like listening to a love song.
