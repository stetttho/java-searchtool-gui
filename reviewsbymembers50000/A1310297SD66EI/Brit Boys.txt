 Beginning with a guitar intro, "Set Me Free" is capable of capturing your attention.  The boys harmonize well and this is an up tempo song that will make you want to do a lil' dance in your seat.  It's not the manufactured pop, but rather, it's pure pop that's very real and not synthetic.  These are skilled boys and I can't get enough of this song!
