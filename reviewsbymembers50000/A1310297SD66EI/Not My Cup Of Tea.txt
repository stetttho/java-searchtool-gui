 My motivation to watch this flick was the fact that Joseph Fiennes was in it.  I'm not a huge history buff, so this just couldn't capture my attention.  After the first 30 minutes or so, even the fact that Joseph Fiennes was in it couldn't keep my attention.  My advice: For the history buffs, or those interested in Elizabeth.  Otherwise, it's a snore.
