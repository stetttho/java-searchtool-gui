 And yet comes another album from yet another boy band.  America can't seem to get enough of them, eh?  Well, I must say, that this album sounds much better than their first album.  Kudos.  The songs are all the same, however.  Ballads, dance, it's all the same from boy band to boy band.  "Give Me Just One Night (Una Noche)" was good, the first 10 times I heard it, but now it's just a lil' redundant. "The Way You Want Me To"...I heard a 2gether version that sounds just like it, and it's not a bad song...all the other songs really aren't that great.  If you're debating which 98 degrees album to get, I would get this.  If you're just a boy band lover, I'd say get this.  If you're kinda into 98 degrees, but not really, don't worry if you don't get this...you're not missin' out on much
