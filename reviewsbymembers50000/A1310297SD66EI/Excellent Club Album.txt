 It took me forever to get a hold of this album and I was glad that I made the effort!  G-A-Y is a club in the UK that I've heard much about and this complaition CD of artists that have performed there over the last 8 years is awesome.  The songs range from Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive" to Vengaboys' "Boom, Boom, Boom".  I can't think of any other complaition album that would have such a wide range of artists and music.  It's a must have if you really enjoy all genres of music from different time periods.  Don't let the title fool you!
