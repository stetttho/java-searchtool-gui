 My favourite song on this cd is Sash!'s "Just Around the Hill" feat. Tina Cousins.  On this Cd, you have a touch of American pop as well as Europop and Eurodance.  The songs range from differnt genres, but all popular in the UK.  I really couldn't stand Daphne and Celeste's "Ugly" becuase it's a cheer that they sang.  It's very chipmunky voiced and not worth the torture.  There are a lot of songs to choose from, so even if you don't like some of them, you may surprise yourself and find others that you do.
