 I must say, I had heard of Boyzone and I thought that they were okay, but then I got this album and I was blown away.  These lads from Ireland are v. talented.  They know how to sing and their songs really stay on your mind.  My favourite song is the Ronan Keating solo, "When You Say nothing At All", which was featured on the Notting Hill soundtrack.  I love that song, because it's so sweet and tender.  I also really enjoy "Words" which was originally sung by the BeeGees, I believe.  It's a great song, becuase the lyrics really say how I feel sometimes.  "Father and Son" was also a really good song.  Originally done by Cat Stevens (I think), it's a really good ballad to listen to.  My favourite up tempo songs are "Key to My Life" and "Love Me For a Reaon".  They're very catchy.  If you like any Boyzone...any at all, I def recommend this album, cause it's got the best of Boyzone.  It's a mix bag of ballads and pop songs.  Enjoy
