 Natural is one of the best songs on the new S Club Album "7".  It has the R&B flavour, but at the same time, it's also able to sound like S Club 7.  Rachel sings lead, which is a break from Jo (not to say she doesn't sound good!).  The snippets on the album are wicked as well.  (The full version sounds better!)  This single is a must get, as well as the album.  S Club works on incorporating new types of music, a more mature sound, to say the least.  The variety of genres of music on the CD make it never tiring for the listener.  A must have (as well as the CD when it's out.)
