 After listening to the first album, my mentality was that these were pretty cool artists, but not the best that there is.  After purchasing this album while I was in England, it was then that I realised that these people were FANTASTIC!  If you were skeptic about the first album, this album will definitely change your mind.  The songs are more mature and they're more fun to listen to.  "Chekkah Bow Bow (The Computer Song)" is hilarious.  You have to pay attention to the lyrics, but it's really funny when you realise what they're saying.  "24/7 in my 911" is a definite party song.  The beat is really great and when the stereo is pumped up...need I say more?  It also features their hits "Shalala Lala", "Kiss (When the Sun Don't Shine)", and Uncle John From Jamaica".  It's far better than "The Party Album" cause this is THE Party Album!
