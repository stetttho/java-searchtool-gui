 A mix bag of an album.  I really enjoy a majority of the songs such as Tom Jones' "Sex Bomb", Robbie Williams' "Rock DJ", Lene Marlin's "Sitting Down Here", Five's "We Will Rock You" and many more.  It's a great complaition CD from the UK and I enjoyed it, but there are some songs that are popular there that I'm not really into.  There are some good dance songs on it, though, which was cool cause the beats are really rockin', especially if you've got a good stereo system.
