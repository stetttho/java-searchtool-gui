 Northern Line may seem like all the other boy bands...and they are.  However, they have a more "bad boy" image and their music is a lil' more tough sounding.  Especially "Run for Your Life."  There's really hard percussion and it sounds really tough, but it's fun to listen to.  The bass is also to a really good beat.  I enjoyed this song and the remixes are awesome, as all UK remixes are. :)
