 The Brits have done it again.  Christian, Mark, and Ste are doing their own thing and doing a fine job of it.  Although they may be squished into the title of "boy band", they have talent and they can really sing.  They play some of their own instruments and their songs are catchy and relaxing.  I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this CD.  Track 4, "Unpredictable" is the best track on the CD, I think because it speaks the truth and it's catchy.  It should be their next single.
