 Despite what I've been reading on some of the review, I think this movie was amazingly done, with awesome choreography, beautiful girls for the guys, and a hot guy with a cute accent for the girls.  Piper Perabo plays Violet, a girl who's dream is to move to New York to become a Song writer.  While she's trying to get people to listen to her demos, she meets a charming fellow named Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia).  Lacking cash, Violet gets a job at a bar called Coyote Ugly, where the girls dress sexy and dance on the bar for the entertainment of the bar goers.  There are so many different stories weaved into this movie, that it would take forever to describe them all.  That and the fact that I don't want to be a spoiler for those who haven't seen the movie.  But let me say this...like any teeny bopper flick, it goes along the story line.  Girl meets guy, they fall in love, they break up, but in the end they end up back together.  However, I wouldn't limit this movie only to teeny boppers.  When I went to the theater, I saw people of all ages sitting and enjoying the movie.  Personally, I loved it so much that after watching it twice in the theater, I ran out and bought the soundtrack (which is incredible) and waited, anticipating the release of this really great movie.  When it was released, I found out that it was only coming out on DVD, which is a real shame, because not everyone has a DVD player, but since I am a devoted fan, I will anticipate the release of this video on VHS.  One more comment, if you're a guy and you're not sure you want to see this becuase it seems like a "chick flick"...one picture...Tyra Banks dancing on the bar.
