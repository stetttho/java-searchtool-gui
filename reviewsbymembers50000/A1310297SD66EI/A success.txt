 Stephen Gately, formerly of Ireland's Boyzone starts a solo career.  This song is one of his single's and it's such a great song.  I love it.  It starts off slow, making you believe that it's a ballad, but then it becomes up-tempo with a really good beat that makes you want to tap your feet or even get up and dance.  What I've gotten from this song is that it's kinda his way of letting the public that he's ready for a "new beginning" away from Boyzone.  Two thumbs up!
