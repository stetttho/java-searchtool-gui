 OMG! This is one SPECTACULAR album! If you're a huge Savage Garden fan, it's a must get. It's different from their first album, in a good way. There are more mellow songs, which relax you, and the up tempo ones are ones that you'll enjoy tapping your feet to. The first single off the album was "I Knew I Loved You" which I thought sounded a lot like "Truly Madly Deeply" from their first album. That was my favourite song, so it was a good reminder to how great Savage Gargen is. I went and got the album and then I listend to "Affirmation". What a brilliant song! I didn't listen to the rest of the album, cause I kept repeating "Affirmation". It's THAT good. I finally decided that I should listen to more of the songs, and my next favourite song is "Crash and Burn" just cause it's a really cool ballad with a beat. And my ALL TIME FAVOURITE song off the album was "The Animal Song", which was found on "The Other Sister" soundtrack. That is one heck of a song. I love listening to the beats and Darren Hayes just has a voice that mesmerizes you...for all we know, he could be singing the phone book, but he's incredible. A definite must for your CD collection.
