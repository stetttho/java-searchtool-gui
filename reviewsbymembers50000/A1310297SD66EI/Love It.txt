 S Club 7 is the next best thing to come out of Britain since Steps.  These quirky 7 members, Hannah, Rachel, Paul, Jon, Jo, Bradley, and Tina, are loads of fun.  Their attempt at a first album is the best I've heard from pop in a long time.  My favourite song is "Gonna Change the World" which is sung by the boys, and it shows a different side to their music.  They have a guitar intro and it's just a really mellow song without a bunch of that pop stuff that they're known for.  Rachel's solo, "I Really Miss You" is really sweet mellow yet up tempo-ish song.  She's got a beautiful voice that can mesmerize.  "You're My Number One" makes you want to get up and dance, cause it's so poppy.  "Viva La Fiesta", "Friday Night", and "It's A Feel Good Thing" have that salsa sound to it, which will make you wanna shake your bum.  "Two in A million" is the best ballad (after "gonna change the world") because it's just really relaxing to listen to.  I love all the songs on the album.  Look out for their sophomore album, which is even better!
