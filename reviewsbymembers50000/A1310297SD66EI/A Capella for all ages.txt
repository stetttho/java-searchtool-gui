 I absolutely LOVE BiTH.  They have a unique sound to them and the best part is that they use only their voices.  No back up or anything.  Like they say "Six guys, six mouths, that's it".  The talented part about them is that they write their own music.  It's amazing how they put everything together.  It takes a lot of patience and coordination.  They perform beautifully on stage and it gets the crowd going.  The best songs on this CD are Helen becuase Mike (the bass) sings it and his voice is absolutely mesmerizing, Home because it just sounds really nice.  I've met these guys and they are awesome and they really care about their fans.  They're trying to make it and share their love of music...especially a capella which is often overlooked.  Two thumbs up!  Something for everyone to enjoy!
