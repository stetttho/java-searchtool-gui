 I'm a fan of Mariah Carey, and I'm a HUGE fan of Westlife, but I can't say that this was the best for either of them.  Mariah's getting old...Westlife is just starting out...it's a good collarboration to get them someplace, but to duet with Mariah Carey...  This is a good song.  I like it, but Mariah could pass this song on her own.  She doesn't need to add a boy band, cause it's mostly her anyway.  Get it if you're a die hard fan, but I wouldn't really recommend it.
