 What a weird weird movie.  The chemistry between Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz really works, but the movie's plot line is just horrid.  It's pointless and I couldn't keep myself glued to the t.v. for however long this movie is.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless they don't have something better to do.
