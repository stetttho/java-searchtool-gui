 The "tough guys" release a ballad.  It doesn't really sound like them.  I love Point Break, but I like their "bad boy" tough attitude and type of music.  The ballad doesn't work for them.  If you like them for being "tough", then I wouldn't reccomend this single, but if you're up to seeing what it's like for them to actually sing instead of their rap, then give it a whirl.
