 A1's attempt to cover Aha's "Take On Me" is absolute genius.  I've heard both versions and all I can say is that you can't tell the difference.  This has a disco-ish sound to it, and a lot of computer sounds.  A1 can really harmonize and they sound terrific in this song.  I definitely recommend it to A1 fans.
