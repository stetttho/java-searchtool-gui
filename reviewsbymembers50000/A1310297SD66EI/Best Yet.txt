 As a huge Mariah Carey fan, I absolutely love this album.  For years, I have been collecting her albums for these songs.  Had I known that eventually they were all gonna be compiled onto one CD, I would've saved my money (although she has had other good songs that were never singles).  There were also songs on here that were new, such as "Sweetheart" with JD, which I found exceptional becuase she works with rap and this song just has me pumpin' up the volume and tappin' my feet.  Another favourite is "I'll Be There".  I first heard the Jackson 5 sing it, but Mariah makes it sound beautiful and it was a nicely done song.  Too bad it was only on her MTV Unplugged album.  "Hero" is a favourite.  I remember hearing that song when I was younger and it's such a sweet ballad that givees a positive message.  It's very inspiring, which is what I think Mariah is.  "One Sweet Day" with Boyz II Men, I think, was the best duet she's ever done.  It was such a great song, and I can remember the first time I heard it and what I was doing.  It's sad, but again, it's an inspiring song.  I wish she had more songs like that.  On the lighter side of things, I really love "Always be my baby" and "Dreamlover" because those are happy songs, and the reason why I remember them are because I really loved Mariah's outfits for them in her vid's.  This is a great CD becuase it's all her #1's (hence the title), and it's a great CD to listen to.  I love it.
