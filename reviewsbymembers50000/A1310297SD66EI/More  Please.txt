 Wow!  I can't say I've been a huge Sting fan.  I've liked his work with the song "All for Love" and stuff, but this was impressive.  I love all the songs.  My attention was first caught with "Desert Rose", which I liked, because he had Cheb Mami on it.  The sound was distinct and you could remember the song.  It gives us a different flavour that's not widely heard around the States.  "Brand New Day" was also a really good song, becuase there's a harmonica and it's just one of those blues-ish songs that's fun to listen.  "A Thousand Years" kinda had an Arabian sound to it, I think.  I can't really place the sound, but it could go in the same category as "Desert Rose".  "Perfect Love...Gone Wrong" wasn't such a great song, however.  It sounded like a jazz song gone bad.  There's rap bits done by a female that's not even understandable.  A song you might want to skip.  This album actually sounds like a mix between many differnt genre's of music, the ones standing out the most are Blues, Jazz, and Arabian-ish.  An album worth getting.
