 I thouht that this movie was a delight to watch.  Not only does it do quite a job presenting what it was like in the 20's, it also showed a (what I thought was a hearfelt story) of how brothers stick together.  The Newton Boys (Willis, Dock, Jess, and Joe) go through years of robbing banks, until they're caught after robbing a train.  Without giving away any of the plot, all I can say is that the Newton Boys bring you through a whole bunch of interesting and entertaining ordeals that will leave you feeling satisfied with the movie.
