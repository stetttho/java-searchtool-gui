 I can say that I was a lil' wary to listen to this song becuase it featured a Spice Girl, but after listening to the song, I was very surprised.  Victoria can actually sing!  I like how they have the computerized voices, which make it sound different.  Dane Bowers is absolutely awesome with Victoria.  The computerized sound is becoming big in British music, and this song helps it get off the ground.  Don't let the fact that it's a Spice Girl turn you off to this song, because this is a fabulous song!
