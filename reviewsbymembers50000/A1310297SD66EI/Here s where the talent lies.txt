 This is an absolute MUST GET album if you're a true hanson fan!  This was the ablum that the boys wrote before they were even signed by a record company!  They were really young, probably ranging between the ages of 8-13 and they were already working on becoming famous!  The boys sound much younger and their voices are much higher, but you have to remember this is before Middle of Nowhere was released.  The song "Soldier" is their song version of Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale about the tin soldier and his balerina...or whatever that tale is.  It's really cute, becuase they have their sibs talking on it.  "The Day Has Come" and "Pictures" sound more like their rock style.  They're really cool, becuase it sounds more mature than their ages.  There's not a single song that I hate on this album.  It was in my CD player everyday when I first got it.  I love all of them.  Fast and slow tempo songs, makes a great mix bag.
