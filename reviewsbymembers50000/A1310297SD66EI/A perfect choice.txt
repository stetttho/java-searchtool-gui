 I absoultely LOVE Mero! I just wish that they had more than one single out, because I can't get enough of them! I listen to this single over and over again without getting tired of it. It's a group of two guys, but it's not entirely pop sounding. It's just fun loving music to relax and enjoy.  The remix is awesome, as all remixes usually are.  They enable you to listen to songs in a whole new perspective.
