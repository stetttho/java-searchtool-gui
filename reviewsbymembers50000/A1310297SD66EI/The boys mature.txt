 Five is an excellent boy band from Britain.  They have this aura that they're bad boys with sweet sensitive sides.  Their first five songs are the rock sounding songs.  "Keep on movin'" is one of my favourites because it's the first song i heard from the album and because it's not totally rock, with a swingin' melody.  "We Will Rock You" is the cover of Queen's original and it's so cool to hear Rich belt it out with all his energy.  He's always been the more quiet one, so that was really cool.  "Don't Fight It Baby" wasn't a real favourite with me...it just doesn't sound like the boys.  It sounds more like the American boy bands that we've been exposed to.  There isn't the five vibe in the song.  Another favourite is "Two Sides to every story" just because the beats are wicked and it's fun to listen to.  It's especially fun to up the volume in your car when listening to this!  The ballad "You Make Me A Better Man" wasn't my cup of tea.  I prefer listening to the boys upbeat songs, so I usually skip over it.  It's a good song, though, but you have to be in the mood to switch from fast tempo to slow.
