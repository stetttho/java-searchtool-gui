 This is my favourite movie of all time.  I must've seen it at least 50 times, and I never tire of it.  The chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey has never been captured by any other onscreen duo, in my opnion.  The music from the movie takes you back in time, and the dancing is such a pleasure to watch.  You see romance unfold as Baby learns how to dance from Johnny.  Patrick Swayze plays the "bad boy" with a soft center and Jennifer Grey plays the naive rich girl.  It's a must see for die hard romance lovers.
