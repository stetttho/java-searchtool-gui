 A great addition to the timeless classic.  I love all the songs on this soundtrack, because it takes me back in time.  These are the songs that will never get old.  This CD is constantly finding it's way back into my CD player, despite all the new CD's I'm constantly getting.  You just can't get enough of it...especially the song "(I've Had) The Time Of My Life" because that's the song that sticks with you, from the movie AND the soundtrack.  I also really love the song "Hungry Eyes" because everytime I hear that song, I can picture the scene from the movie, where Johnny is working on teaching Baby how to dance in preparation for their first show.  That's when you first see the attraction building.  It's a wonderful soundtrack and I highly recommend it.
