 The CD-ROM edition of the American Heritage Dictionary is a good companion  to the book edition. It is far easier to look up a word on the CD-ROM  than to thumb through the pages of the book.  The fonts on the CD-ROM are  much easier on the eyes than the small print of the printed  dictionary. Because the American Heritage Dictionary is interesting to  browze through, most readers will also want to purchase the book.  Regrettably, the CD-ROM does not include most of the excellent color  illustrations which are found in the print edition. One other note --  while the vastly inferior Encarta World English Dictionary allows users to  download the dictionary onto their hard disk so they can use it without  having the CD-ROM in their drive, I have not been able to find a way to do  this with the American Heritage Dictionary CD-ROM.  But it is well  worthwhile to keep the AHD CD-ROM in the drive in order to use it.
