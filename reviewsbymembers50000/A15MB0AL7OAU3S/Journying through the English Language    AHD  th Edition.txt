 The Fourth Edition of the American Heritage Dictionary has preserved all  the best features of the Third Edition -- and the illustrations are now in  color!  While it is easier to look up words on a CD-ROM, it is worth buying  the book, too, because readers can find much interesting information  browsing through it.  Everywhere, there are interesting word histories,  usage notes, notes on regional usages and notes on recent changes in the  English language. An appendix with Indo-European roots, while somewhat  technical, provides a wealth of interesting information.  Readers can  learn, for instance, that a commonly-used obscenity is derived from the  same Indo-European root as the word "science." The new edition  has added an index of roots from the Semitic languages which have found  their way into English, including in the names of people in the  Bible. The many features of this dictionary make it more than just an  ordinary reference book.  It can provide many hours of pleasure wandering  through its pages.
