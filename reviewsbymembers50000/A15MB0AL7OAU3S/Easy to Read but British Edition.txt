 Oxford University Press deserves credit for publishing an edition of the NRSV which can be read by some people with poor eyesight.  The only thing which keeps this edition from being perfect is that it is the "Anglicized Edition" which OUP produced for use in Britain, rather than the standard American edition -- a fact which is not made evident anywhere on the cover! The differences are extremely minor -- spelling, punctuation and perhaps one different word per hour of reading.  However, American readers with ordinary eyesight who want an easily readable edition of the NRSV text will prefer the New Oxford Annotated Bible, Third Edition -- and they will get that Bible's study notes in addition to the text.
