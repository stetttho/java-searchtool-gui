 Oxford has greatly improved its New Annotated Study Bible.  The notes are far more extensive than in previous editions.  In addition to including the complete text of the NRSV in an easy-to-read typeface, this new edition contains notes pointing out information and meanings which are not obvious from just reading the text and, in places, indicating meanings from the underlying Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts which are not evident in the NRSV translation. The notes are entirely scholarly and do not attempt to teach any religious doctrine. In places, the NOAB Third Edition is less thorough in its notes than the competing HarperCollins Study Bible, but the notes are better written and far less tedious to read.
