 This study Bible contains the Jewish Publication Society's "Tanakh" translation of the Jewish scriptures [the Old Testament to Christians], together with extensive notes.  The notes reflect modern scholarship, also indicate how a passage has been interpreted throughout the long history of Judaism and how a passage is used in Judaism today.  Frequently, the notes give alternatives to the meanings presented in the translation.  While the notes are far more extensive than in ecumenical study Bibles [such as the New Oxford Annotated Bible and the HarperCollins Study Bible], they serve only as a bare introduction to the vast wealth of Jewish commentary on the Bible. The JPS translation, like all Jewish translations, adheres to the Masoretic (traditional) Hebrew text used in the Jewish liturgy.  Most Christian translations substitute readings from other sources (such as the Greek Septuagint translation and the Dead Sea Scrolls) when they are thought to be more accurate than the Masoretic Text. This study Bible does not pretend that, in places, other sources may reflect the original form of the text.  The notes -- both to the Study Bible and the translation -- suggest possible alternate readings from other sources. A long section of articles in the back of the Study Bible provides an introduction to Jewish interpretation and use of the Bible throughout the ages. While it is impossible for any one-volume work to do more than scratch the surface of Jewish Bible scholarship throughout the ages, the Jewish Study Bible provides an introduction for Jews, and others who are interested in Judaism, to Jewish Bible study.  It is definitely worth buying by those who do not have the time (or the money) for a multiplicity of volumes.
