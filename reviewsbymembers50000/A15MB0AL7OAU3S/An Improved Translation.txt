 The TNIV translation will be controversial because of its use of gender-neutral language.  However, it is much more sensible than the NRSV in its usage.  In all the places where I had suspected that the NRSV had gone overboard, the TNIV retains the masculine gender.  The TNIV shows much less denominational bias than the NIV.  While it retains "virgin" in Isaiah 7:14, it gives "young woman" as an alternate reading in the margins.  In the places where I have compared it with the NIV, it shows an improvement in style.  The use of gender-neutral language in Bible translations is controversial -- but the use of language such as the word "brothers" to indicate both male and female Christians, while a literal translation of the Greek, can be misleading to modern readers.  But in some cases the Bible refers specifically to men.  When the Old Testament refers to the "fatherless," it refers to children who have lost their fathers -- not "orphans" as the NRSV translates.  In Biblical times, the father was a child's primary economic support.  The TNIV appears to exercise far better judgment than the NRSV.
