 I dove into Up Island on July 3, and emerged on July 5 -- not exactly refreshed and renewed, but feeling like I'd spent a weekend with a soul sister.  This is the first ARS book I've read, and I love the way she immerses you in both the emotional and physical environment of her character.  Yes, I suppose that Molly doesn't qualify as a 90's woman -- she ends up taking care of others instead of herself.  But, you know, this seems to me to be a classic kind of mid-life story.  Sometimes we do find ourselves by taking care of others.  And, the reality for women Molly's (and my) age is that you find yourself bidding farewell: to children, sometimes spouses and parents, and caring for aging parents at the same time.  I love the way Molly finds herself healing:  slowly, quietly, even as she tells herself, "I need to really deal with this."  I'll definitely try some of ARS other books.
