 I have used this book quite a bit, and do find it useful, although I find "The Big Book of Presentation Games" better for my purposes.  I think the ice-breaker ideas are good, especially the bingo game, which I've  used a couple times with success.  I also think some of the problem-solving  ideas are good.
