 My workgroup purchased this book some time ago.  Judy writes excellent,  no-nonsense books about RPG programming.  We all find this to be a very  helpful text.  Especially our junior programmers find it useful.  For  example, she has a whole chapter on structured programming.  That's  something the senior programmers don't care about (and one therefore  doesn't much like the book), but still it's an excellent text.  It's  usually pretty easy to find what you need in the index, and her examples  are easy to follow.
