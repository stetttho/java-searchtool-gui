 Each volume of Scott's The Raj Quartet has its own beauty and power.  This volume could perhaps be said to view of India from the English point of view... although that viewpoint is, like India itself, always shifting, sometimes hallucinatory.  The character I love most in this volume is the  missionary, who comes to live in Rose Cottage... she is a link between the  first volume, and the symbolic picture "The Jewel in the Crown",  and the post-war India to come.  To say what happens to her would give away  the story... suffice to say that Scott's powers of characterization are as  brilliant as ever.  If you have read the first 2 volumes, you are already  hooked, and will hardly need this review to read on! The Raj Quartet is  one of the finest works of literature I have read.  Don't miss it.
