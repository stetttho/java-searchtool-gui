 I am loving every page of this book!  Lora Brody's unique approach of  modifying each recipe to different types of bread machines makes it much  easier to succeed.  Her hints on trouble-shooting are practical and easy to  apply.  And the recipes... my family has developed a new addiction to the  Cinnamon Braid Bread!
