 Jane Hamilton's books are certainly memorable.  "Book of Ruth" contained one of those scenes which will remain burned into my brain cells.  However, "Map of the World" seems to have all the cynicism and darkness, with none of the intensity or sense of redemption.   Characterization seemed weak - I couldn't muster enough interest about the  characters to really care what happened to them.  I'm surprised this is an  Oprah pick.
