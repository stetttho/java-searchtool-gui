 This is the 2nd in the Catherine LeVendeur series, and is every bit as enjoyable as the first.  Edgar and Catherine are a great sleuthing pair, and the 12th century detail is fascinating.  I also appreciate Newman's  character development; even minor characters are well-developed and  interesting.
