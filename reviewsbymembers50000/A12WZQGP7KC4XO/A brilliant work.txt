 This is an absolutely brilliant work.  Read all 4 volumes -- don't stop with this first volume.  Scott begins this volume with "...this is the story of a rape..."  As the work progresses the rape, and the people  involved in it, become symbols of India, of the Raj - and become much  larger than mere characters. That said, the characterization is  incredible -- even minor characters who appear only briefly are cunningly  sketched.  The stories are gripping.  I read all 4 volumes in about a  month.  I just couldn't put it down.  Finishing it, I was left knowing more  -- and knowing less -- about India during the decline of British rule.  I  think that is what Scott intended.
