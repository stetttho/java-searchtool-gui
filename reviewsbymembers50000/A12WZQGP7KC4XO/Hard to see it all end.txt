 I hated to see this lush, vast series come to an end.  However, as the Raj ends, so does the Raj Quartet.  We see some of the natural conclusions of colonial rule, and of the love/hate relationships between the rulers and the ruled ... madness, depravity, love, denial... and the future, both of  India and of the characters in the series.
