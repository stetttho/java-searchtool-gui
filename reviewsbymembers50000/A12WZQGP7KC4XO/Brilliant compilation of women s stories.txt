 Jill Ker Conway is a good writer and editor.  She has collected here a group of American women's stories, all of which are fascinating.  Before each memoir, she writes a short explanation, but it is the women's stories  that stick with you.  The ones that stuck with me most were the one of the  escaping slave woman, who hid in an attic crawl space for almost a year, so  desperate was she for freedom -- and the one written by Margaret Sanger.  I  give this book frequently as a gift to young women -- for Bat Mitzvah,  graduation, to mark some important milestone in their lives.  By reading  about other women's struggles to define their lives, you learn more about  your own.
