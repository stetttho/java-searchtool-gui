 "To be human is to be born into the world with something to achieve, namely, the fullness of one's human nature, and it is through the virtues that one does so...the virtues are the only guarantee against a wasted life."    -Paul Waddell Shadow Dance is an easy to understand and very helpful text for those wishing to  find and then befriend all those elements  we don't like about ourselves, are afraid to admit or maybe even unaware.   In addition, each chapter  also provides exercises that allow us to  search for and accept all our positive and untapped potentials that prevent us from living a genuinely satisfying life and engaging in authentic relationships withourselves and others.    Shadow Dance is an exciting journey of mindfulness that takes you  into the untapped areas of your mind and soul.
