 This is probably one of the productions from Connick's earlier years that he would probably just prefer to disappear into the video twilight zone. You can pass on purchasing this video unless you are a serious Harry Connick Jr fan..or in the mood for a good Christmas chuckle.  The musical concert performance is notable as Connick picks a nice selection of spiritual Christmas songs along with a few secular ones and swings out with his band and orchestra. The interspersed short acted skits however are very hokey and the younger Connick looks like a deer stunned with headlights in some parts. The video production is just generally bland and lackluster and just doesn't add anything new or exciting to the holiday musical selections.  Even with guest stars Carol Burnett in small skit and a duet with Aaron Neville, this video falls short of what you would expect from a talented musician as Connick. This video just doesn't seem to portray and express the enthusiasm, energy level and acting ability that Connick has appeared to develop over more recent years. I highly recommend Connick's audio CD "When My Heart Finds Christmas" but save this video production for the holiday archives.
