 Although she is a magnificent singer and has acted in numerous movies, I believe this to be one of the few films in which Ms Ross ever showcased any stellar acting ability. I agree with the reviewer that implied she left her real acting talent somewhere along the Yellowbrick Road.   This movie gives but a glimpse of the grief, heartache and loss experienced by Billie Holiday in her tragically short life. Some visual images used in the movie are quite intense and emotionally riveting. They make it easy to understand how the 'blues' are truly experienced.   Ms Ross's smooth jazzy vocals resonate the soundtrack with a contrasting clarity to Holiday's original recordings but superbly capture the emotional intensity of Billie's vaccilating depression and addiction.  Billy Dee Williams and Richard Pryor are excellent in supporting roles. Williams provides the love and compassion that just aren't enough to rescue Holiday from the depths of her addiction. Pryor and Scatman Crothers (in a small role) add some islands of comic relief to the generally depressed mood.   Lady Sings the Blues is for those who want to get a glimpse of the tragic life of Billy Holiday. It's also for those who want to see Ms Ross's best dramatic performance and won't be upset with her 'smoother' vocal renditions of the Lady Day songbook.
