 Horror Hotel was originally released in 1960,  the same year as Alfred HItchcock's original Psycho.  Apparently, it was also made on a much  lower budget and I  suspect these factors may  be responsible for this film's  unjust obscurity.   I originally saw this movie only once, over 20 years ago, but  some  vivid images of certain scenes really stuck with me.   The release to video,  and now even DVD,  has been long awaited.   This b&w classic features a very young Christopher Lee in a  simple but eerie tale involving witchcraft and the mysterious disappearance of a woman college student  in a small New England  town.  There are definitely some parts of this film that scare without a drop of blood ever being shown.  In addition to the topics of devil worship and witchcraft, the b&w cinematgraphy, the background music & chanting, the foggy  night setting, the desolateness of the town and the aura of each of the characters all add to the  mysterious and eerie atmosphere of this film. This movie appeals to the fundamental elements of all  fans of the horror genre.  We like horror movies because part of us is naturally  and curiously drawn to intrigue and mystery.   A part of us will identify with the curiosity of the woman studying witchcraft.  The trap door  she opens under the rug in her  hotel room symbolizes  a willingness to explore the dark,  mysterious  and intriguing unknown.   I won't say another word ... other than if you collect horror movies, you will definitely want to own  this one.  It's also worth the rental if you can find a video store that has a copy.
