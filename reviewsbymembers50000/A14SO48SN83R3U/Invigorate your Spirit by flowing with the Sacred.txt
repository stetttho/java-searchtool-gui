 This is not your typical relaxation music. These spiritual rhythms do an excellent job of redirecting an anxious racing mind and will help you refocus mental energies in the most healing and energetic way.  I totally disagree with the earlier reviewer that felt these selections will leave you strengthless and depressed. I found quite the opposite to be true!  If you don't find yourself singing along, you WILL find yourself humming these rhythms long after you listen to them. Although a bit perseverative, the Kirtan Posse female chorus adds a soul touching devotional to the selections.  Mountain Hare Krishna, which incorporates the song "Amazing Grace" and features articulate harmonies from Sting (Sting-ji) is simply beautiful and very uplifting.  Although the Ring Song sounds like something that would be played on a Hindu cruise ship, it adds an element of whimsy to this spiritual collection and ends this musical spiritual journey on a most energetic note.  Start your morning off with this CD. It will invigorate your spirit.
