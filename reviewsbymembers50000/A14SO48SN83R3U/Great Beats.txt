 I agree with the other reviewer about the songwriting not being as good as her other projects but the beats on this one will definitely get you moving. They will stay with you long after the EP is finished playing.  Ms Badu has a way of bringing you right into her funky, soulful and positively charged world with her music. Her energy is as usual, nothing but positive, and when this EP reaches it's end, you will want to go back into her Worldwide Underground for more.
