 Even though this book marked his debut over 10 years ago, Emporer of the Air is no doubt, Ethan Canin's best work.  If you can appreciate short stories dealing with life's simplicities, you will enjoy reading this.   The stories are introspective, cerebral,  life-affirming and emotionally validating, especially for men.  Women readers get an intimate illustration of the workings of the male psyche in the rich detail of Canin's characters and their relationships. In his stories, Canin touches upon relationships, such as those between fathers and sons and also basic but complex emotions such as anger, jealousy, shame and vulnerability.  His men feel  their emotions viscerally and Canin's writing allows you to feel them and also to empathize with each character.  Those  readers capable of empathy and willing to accept their own humanity and vulnerabilities will find the content of these stories somewhat invigorating and far from 'trite'.  Sometimes life's most wonderful or tragic experiences are found in the simplest of events and  the most fleeting of moments. These are the experiences Ethan Canin is concerned with.
