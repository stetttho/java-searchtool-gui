 I cherish both my original (1980) and new Sesquicentennial Editions of this book.  Down Barnegat Bay: A Nor'easter Midnight Reader is my favorite chronicle of the maritime history and folklore of the Jersey Shore.  The historical narratives catapult the reader into an era when the now densely populated areas along the Barnegat Bay were filled with sailors, fishermen, Indians and farmers.  Tales of shipwrecks, pirates and the Lenni-Lenapi Indians along the Metedeconk River are exciting to read and add immensely to the feeling of being "transported in time" as do the many illustrations that look as if they were taken from a scrapbook in your great grandparent's attic (some of them may have been!).  Down Barnegat Bay gives the reader more than an appreciation for an area so rich in maritime history and folklore..it TAKES them there. For me personally, being an avid and routine paddler of the Jersey Shore, Down Barnegat Bay: A Nor'easter Midnight Reader has transformed my kayak trips on the bay and canoe trips on the peaceful Metedeconk River into a new communion with the Shore area land and sea.  Paddling "Down Barnegat Bay", I can experience the exciting, life affirming SynchronicitY of the past and present moment.   Thank you Robert Jahn.
