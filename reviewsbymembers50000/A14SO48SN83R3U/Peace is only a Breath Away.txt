 This is probably one of the most simple yet profound books I have ever read. It significantly increased my awareness of how accessible peace of mind, body and spirit is. It reads very easy and the insights are simple observations that in our busy lives, we often forget or take for granted.  With mindfulness and some practice of breathing and 'enjoying doing the dishes' we can learn to grow from and fully enjoy the process of living and the diversity of life's experiences. Regardless of your spiritual tradition, and without trying to 'convert you to Buddhism', this book will help you realize that peace of mind, body and spirit is internal and only a breath away.  I feel this book promotes world peace, one reader at a time, since peace on earth begins in the heart. I have given many copies as gifts and enjoy hearing how others that I have given the book to are now also passing it along. I especially recommend this book to those who feel they need to slow down (or have been told by others or their doctor that they should). It's time to stop and smell the roses. If you have never read Thich Nhat Hanh...start your journey here.
