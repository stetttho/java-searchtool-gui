 Don't expect  Donna's Disco Christmas.  She proves to be another pop diva who is not afraid to keep the Christ in Christmas in this well crafted, classic, and highly recommended additon to any Christmas music collection.   While this CD covers some  solemn and religious Christmas standards (a far cry from the orgasmic moaning of her  disco anthem "Love to Love you Baby" ), it does so with the power and passion expected of a true diva.    She puts the spirit of the season in  your heart on some standard spiritual Christmas classics such as "O Come All Ye Faithful,  "O Holy NIght"  and a medley of "What Child is This, "Do You Hear What I Hear" and "Joy to the World".  Her orginal tracks, "Christmas Spirit"  and "Lamb of God" capture the essence of the season  with  the most heart warming lyrics and her passionate vocals  as does her version of Amy Grant's "Mary, Breath of Heaven" (These are the ones that will give you the chills). Another less religious original "Christmas is Here" and some other secular standards such as  "I'll Be Home for Christmas",  "The Christmas Song", and  "White Christmas"  also add to this  highly recommended collection Summer Christmas cheer.
