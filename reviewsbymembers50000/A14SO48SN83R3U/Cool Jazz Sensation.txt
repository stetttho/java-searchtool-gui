 This is another classic jazz masterpiece and  probably one of the most beautiful jazz albums ever created.  This Davis craft is quiet, subdued and introspective yet energetic.  It features Miles with John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Cannonball Adderley and it captures one of the most simple and synchronistic group improvisations ever recorded.  Miles, with his trumpet, speaks to your soul in a most musically articulate, pure and creative way.  Kind of Blue  takes you beyond listening.  This is spontaneous jazz you FEEL.
