 If you are planning to kayak (or even raft)  any of the Southeastern Rivers, you will want to have this hilarious handwritten  Nealy guide.  (For those not familiar with Nealy, this book is not meant to be a technical  river guide).  Although some of the rapids he highlights have been significantly altered by mother nature over the last 20 years, the reader still gets a  humorous look at the  "hydro-namics" of the various rapids on the rivers he describes.    In addition to his commentary on the rapids of each river, Nealy also includes his trademark comical sketches which have helped make his books so popular. Like his other classic kayaking books, this is a comic book river guide for the Southeast Rivers. (Rivers included are the Cheat, Chatahoochee, Chatooga, French Broad, Gauley, Haw, Hiawasee, Locust Fork, Nantahala, New River Gorge, Nolichucky, Savage and Youghiogheny.)  Paddlers will appreciate the descriptions of the rivers, some b/w photos and the comical sketches of the major rapids of each river.  In addition he also includes a funny glossary section of  river and paddling terminology with his highly opinionated sociocultural paddling commentary  offered throughout.   As paddlesports are becoming increasingly popular and thus "more commercially marketable" in the US, Nealy's books and commentary are becoming even more funny, more meaningful and somewhat prophetic.
