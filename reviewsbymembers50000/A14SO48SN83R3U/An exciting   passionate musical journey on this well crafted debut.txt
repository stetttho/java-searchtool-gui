 Excellent songwriting and Broussard's simple and articulate vocals make every one of the tracks on this CD an enjoyable story.   There are elements of matured blues, r&B, folk and funk woven throughout.  Broussard appears to showcase a diverse vocal and musical style with tracks ranging from slow, folky ballads to more energetic groovy funk. You can hear the musical influences of Stevie Wonder on one track, smooth jazz elements of George Benson on another and vocals that sound like Lenny Kravitz on another. One thing is for sure, these accoustic and vocal elements mix well to make one great debut CD.   Some great improvisational vocals add an element of extreme depth and spontaneity to this well crafted production. The lyrics although somewhat spiritually thought-provoking and life affirming, are still fun to listen to.   You will be singing after just one listen.
