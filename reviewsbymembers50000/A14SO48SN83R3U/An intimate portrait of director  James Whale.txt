 If you've enjoyed the old classic Universal Studio films of Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein, you will especially enjoy this feature, since it is basically a story about the last days of the creative genius and the director of those films, James Whale.  The story of Gods and Monsters generally revolves around an emotionally traumatized and physically ailing movie director (majestically played by Ian McKellan), his attraction to his new gardener (played by Brendan Fraser), and the resulting emotionally intense and tumultous relationship that follows. In this movie, Brendan Fraser gives one of his better acting perfomances. Ironically, Fraser's overall physique and head shape are some very striking physical features which happen to resemble Whale's Frankenstein monster. Lynn Redgrave (who you can barely recognize in her part) is cast as James Whale's annoyingly moralizing yet concerned caretaker (and she's just as annoying as the caretaker in the original Bride of Frankenstein)  Initially, this movie is slow moving but it is no doubt, a thought and affect provoking film that provides some interesting and intriguing insights into man's fears, and the nature of intimacy, loneliness, love and human nature in general. By portraying Whale's experiences, Gods and Monsters also provides some excellent insights into Whale's movie themes and brings you behind the curtain into the Hollywood movie culture.   The bright and vivid colors of the cinematography of this film are an ironic contrast to Whale's old B&W horror movies and to his themes which generally involved the 'darker' or more 'taboo' sides of human nature and emotion.  This is a cerebral drama. Gods and Monsters is a movie about genuine relationships rich in emotion and affect. It's likely to trigger your own strong emotional response. Beware!
