 If you grew up with any sense of Christian or Catholic dogma you will surely need to repent after watching this one .. or risk going straight to hell in a handbasket! The fundamentalists surely think Lynch is the Anti-Christ.  Armed only with his acoustic guitar and boyish charm, Lynch articulates some of the silliest, crudest and creative stories you will ever hear recorded.  The DVD "extra's" are also well worth the price of admission!  This is a great DVD for anyone not familiar with Stephen Lynch.  Although those already familiar with him will find some of the material redundant, this DVD will still make you laugh as it captures all Lynch's characteristic facial grimacing and hysterical mannerisms which are missed on his audio CDs.  Those who've seen him live will know what I'm talking about.  If you like to laugh, and sexual topics, vuglarity and "over the edge humor" don't offend you, join Lynch for an intimate night  recorded live at the El Ray Theatre in Los Angeles.
