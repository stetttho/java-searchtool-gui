 Sweet love is what will be flowing from the first moments you put this CD on.  It's classic mood music for those romantic times together with your spouse or lover.  This lady of song is smooth and sultry  and her intense vocals are nothing less than perfect on every selection.  Her scat is flawless and hypnotic.  Call her music whatever you'd like... 'adult contemporary', 'pop'  or  smooth jazz.   One thing is for sure, Anita Baker can sing and this CD is the soundtrack of love.   Keep the birth control close by.
