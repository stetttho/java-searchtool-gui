 A bit expensive for a manual type guide (minus one star). The larger than normal type and simple language makes this guide an easy read and a  very  useful one,  especially for those who are new to the sport of  kayaking.    The chapters on safety, rescues and signals could be literal lifesavers and  are essential reading for anyone entering the paddling experience (ok..so  if it saves your life..it's worth the price).    However, if you are  already familiar with the paddling basics (strokes, safety,  etc), there's  nothing much new here, except for some specific information tailored to  sit-on- top type kayaks.  For those planning to paddle in the ocean,  chapters on waves, tides and kayak surfing are useful and  informative.
