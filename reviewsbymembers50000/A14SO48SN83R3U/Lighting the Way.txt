 This is a great little reference book for those who travel the NJ waterways and/or have an interest in the history of the NJ lights.  In addition to the more well known NJ lights such as "Old Barney" at the Barnegat Inlet and Twin Lights in Sandy Hook, Gately's book lists them all, including some which no longer stand. Although very interesting, many of the listings leave the reader wanting more details.  I hope a new edition, at some point, will provide more!
