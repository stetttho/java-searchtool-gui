 I am an avid sea kayaker and got this book after I injured my neck to help develop a rehabilitation program designed to gradually get me back to paddling long distances. Ideally, this book should be used to prevent injuries, especially those caused by overexertion.  FIT TO PADDLE provides a sports specific conditioning program which will keep all types of paddlers in top paddling form. The book also includes sample home workout programs and a chart of the muscular system.  I highly suggest this book for all paddlers who are looking to build strength, flexibility and endurance, increase balance and coordination and help prevent overexertion injuries.  The step by step instructions for the exercises are easy to follow and include photos. The exercises can be performed at home, at the gym or on the water.  This is a great resource for all recreational and/or competitive paddlers.
