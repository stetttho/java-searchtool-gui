 This is a great book to get children (and even some adults) beyond egocentric thinking, to expose them  to diverse cultural icons and  to the celebration of individual differences.  Each page is richly illustrated in  colorful  "where's waldo-esque" detail, providing plenty of stimulation to keep children focused and interested  through its entirety.  Some of the visual images do reflect outdated cultural stereotypes, but do not detract from the main theme.
