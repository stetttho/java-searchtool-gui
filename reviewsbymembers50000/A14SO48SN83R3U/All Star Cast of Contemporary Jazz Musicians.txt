 Although MoodSwing retains some traditional stylings, Redman sparks a contemporary and very refreshing jazz synergy with Brad Mehldau on piano, Christian McBride on bass and Brian Blade on drums. MoodSwing was released in 1994 and I agree with the previous reviewers that stated this recording really set the stage for the creative evolution of these talented musicians in becoming the contemporary jazz leaders they currently are.   As a result of Redman's superior improvisational skills, the selections on MoodSwing do seem lyrical in their expression and this is a large part of what makes this project so enjoyable to listen to. Every track is a perfectly crafted joy to the ear.  If you are new to jazz or to Joshua Redman, you will want to add the sound of this incredibly talented quartet to your collection.
