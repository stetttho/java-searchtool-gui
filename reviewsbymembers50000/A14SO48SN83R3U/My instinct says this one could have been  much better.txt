 Don't  expect to see Hopkins playing Hannibal Lector here.  It has it's moments and generally a good plot, but this movie seems to be lacking something that's not clearly identifiable.  Hopkins is an anthropologist and societal outcast (by choice) brought back the US from Africa after committing murders for which he had his motives (I can't spoil the plot). Upon his return, he becomes the subject of psychological scrutiny by  newbie psychiatrist Cuba Gooding Jr who attempts to build a "therapeutic" rapport with his character to unravel the motives of the murders. The real  irony is the way Hopkin's character protected that which he studied while neglecting his own offspring.  A  thought provoking look at human nature,  "civilized culture" and the reality (or illusion?)  of "freedom". Hopkins  saves this movie and delivers his usual great performance.  Although I like Gooding's acting in general, he just doesn't cut it as the psychiatrist in this one. His cathartic outburst at the end is laughable.
