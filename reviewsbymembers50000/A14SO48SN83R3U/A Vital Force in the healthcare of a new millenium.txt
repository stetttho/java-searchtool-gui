 If you are not familiar with how homeopathy works exactly, George Vitoulkas outlines the theory and practice of this energy medicine and how it works to strenghen the immunity system and stimulate our 'vital force'. The Science of Homeopathy is a classic text which will significantly impact the way you view health and illness.  I highly recommend this book for any academic scholar who is dissatisfied with our current and ailing system of allopathic medicine or who is interested in simply knowing more than what homeopathy is. It is only for the seriously interested layperson however, as it is may be considered a 'technical and highly challenging read. The Science of Homeopathy has profound implications for the future of health care AND for the evolution of the human organism.
