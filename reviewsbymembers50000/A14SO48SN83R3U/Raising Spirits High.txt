 Editorial critic Scott Wilson is way off base with his review of this one. This is one of Whitney's most inspirational, soul filled and spirited projects.  Although not her most recent, this is one of Whitney's most inspirational, soul filled and spirited projects.  This one gives us only a glimpse of what Whitney could do if she really let her gospel roots dominate.  Her vocal delivery borders flawless. She articulately and powerfully belts them out, some with the added inspirational power of a gospel choir backing her up.   This soundtrack will raise your spirits high.  In this soundtrack, Whitney shares her heart, soul and spirit with the listener. The inspirational energy and passion she emits on this album have yet to be matched on any of her others.  I hope she soon finds her way back to that spirit filled place.
