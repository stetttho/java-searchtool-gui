 Honestly, her voice got on my nerves back in the late 70's when she debuted with her popular  "Chuck E's in Love",  so I never really listened to her later material.  It wasn't until my musical taste widened and matured that I later went back to some of her compositions and discovered what a very talented lyricist and storyteller Rickie Lee Jones is.  Although Pirates was released back in 1981, it remains one of my favorite CDs.  It displays Rickie's  master songwriting ability and proves her a  musical storyteller of high emotional intensity and clarity.  Her urban stories are set in a 'groovy',  bohemian and vivid blend of folk, blues and jazzy musical compositions.  In addition, one selection features jazz artists David Sanborn on alto sax and  Randy Brecker on the trumpet and flugelhorn. If you have never listened to Rickie Lee Jones, I highly suggest Pirates as it will move you emotionally and may even get your  head shaking, feet stomping and fingers snapping.
