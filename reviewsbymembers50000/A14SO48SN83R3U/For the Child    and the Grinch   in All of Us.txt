 We all can be a Grinch sometimes, but during Christmas I love to be a kid (..and pretty much all year round).  If you grew up watching "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" during the season then you will love this CD since it features not only  the original songs  but also the original narration by Boris Karloff. The movie is a timeless Dr Seuss Classic and now you can have the music to sing along with during the holidays. <singing>  Fra  Hoo  For Ay ,    Da  Hoo  Door Ay  -  Christmas Time is Here!
