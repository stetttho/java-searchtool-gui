 An entertaining journey down a beautiful whitewater river with an age old theme of good vs evil.  This is a good movie to just sit back and enjoy the ride even though as the plot develops you may feel bit uncomfortable.   Meryl Streep is outstanding as usual, however I feel Kevin Bacon is even better as the deceptive, yet charming 'bad guy'. There is also some excellent acting by David Straithairn (who portrays Meryl Streep's husband) even though his character is annoyingly pathetic.   The nature cinematography is spectacular and the high intensity musical score only adds excitement to the journey. I highly recommend watching this one on a home theater system with wide screen and DTS sound decoding.
