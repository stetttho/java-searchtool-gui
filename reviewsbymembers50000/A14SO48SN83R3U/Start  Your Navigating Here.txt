 Ray Killen has put together a great foundational navigation reference which condenses a variety of intricate navigational information into one concise primer.  In this guide, Killen takes a relatively bland, technical subject matter and uses the same witty linguistic style that he uses to teach his very popular instructional courses.  In addition to providing the basics of kayak navigation in an "easy to understand" manner, Killen's book provides an enjoyable read. I highly recommend this navigational primer for any beginning sea kayaker who plans to drop a paddle in any tidal river, bay or ocean.  I also recommend Killens book as a prerequisite to David Burch's more comprehensive and detailed "Fundamentals of Kayak Navigation".
