 Kudos to Ron Howard! This is one of the best inspirational movies I have seen in a long time. Nash is more than just an eccentric, nutty Princeton mathematics professor. He has schizophrenia and struggles hard, but like many of us, to 'come to terms' with love, uncertainty, his thoughts, dreams & fantasies, and his perception of reality.  The movie also, in some ways, challenges stereotyped ideas about mental illness and our notion of absolute facts and 'truths'. Although the perseverative and psychotic symptoms of Nash's illness are very frustrating to watch, his character invokes enough sympathy to make the viewer almost wish his stories were true and that he's really not mentally ill.  Superb acting by Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris.  Overall, this film creatively and intensely illustrates the power of love and the resiliency & triumph of the human spirit.
