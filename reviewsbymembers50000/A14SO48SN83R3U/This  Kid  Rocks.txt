 This is the Jonny Lang album most people don't know about. Relative to his more recent and more commercially successful albums, this debut CD is refreshingly underproduced, representing a simpler and more raw form of electric and acoustic blues. This 'kid' Jonny can sing AND play guitar. His raspy, soulful vocals and lyrical content make him sound slightly beyond his years and the musical chemistry between him and the rest of the Big Bang seems to work well to make a pleasantly simple, but rockin' debut album.  Jonny, with his already aged voice, will no doubt, only add more credibility to his blues and lyrics with some more years of experience. Keep your ears tuned in to this boy's guitar.
