 This is a re-release of the Jonny Lang debut CD which was initially released independently in 1995.  Originally billed as "Kid" Jonny Lang and the Big Bang, the "kid" has been rightfully dropped from the title on this re-release.  Lang's recent CDs and live concert tour performances proves he can rock with the best of them. In a rock & roll rite of initiation, he recently opened up for the Rolling Stones in their NYC concert and later jammed with them during their encore. He's no longer "the kid". Welcome Mr Jonny Lang! This CD immediately proved that Jonny Lang can sing AND play guitar. Lang's talent does not get lost in overproduction and his simpler and more pure form of electric and acoustic blues is highly evident. Two of my favorite tracks on this CD, "Changes" and "E-Train" are written by Ted "Lightnin' Boy" Larsen who also plays guitar and does background vocals. The acoustic and electric synergy between Lang and Larsen (and the rest of the Big Bang) is very highly charged and unfortunately unmatched on Lang's subsequent CDs since the Big Bang band doesn't perform on Lang's other CDs. Lang's seemingly aged voice never made him sound like a kid, but age and experience will no doubt, only add more credibility to this young man's blues and lyrics. His already awesome guitar playing will only get better with more experience. As fans, we can really enjoy the process..and this great CD.
