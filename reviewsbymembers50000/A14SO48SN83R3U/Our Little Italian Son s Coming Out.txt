 Those who are from or have experience with the Italian melodramatic family system will probably appreciate this film.  Yes, the ethno-humor is a bit over the top but still manages to get a few laughs and remain cute. Cute and funny are the keywords here, as there's very little seriousness in the manner in which this movie depicts the "coming out" theme. It might be funny to see how the movie would work if it was set in South Philly or Mulberry St in NY's Little Italy. It's set in a small suburban Italian neighborhood of Montreal.  Much to his parent's dismay, the main character, Angelo (played by Luke Kirby), isn't interested in finding a 9-5 job with good security or a nice Italian girl to marry.  He also doesn't want to hang out in gay bars, march in the gay parade or even answer the phones for the gay hotline, but he does want to love someone and he wants his parents to know and accept who he really is.  He envisions a life very different than the one his parent's had and one which strays from the traditions in which he was raised.  He lives with his boyfriend and wants to write movies so you can just imagine the drama that ensues with "La Famiglia".  Paul Sorvino doesn't stray too far from his typecast as the Italian father, but his acting remains refreshing.  With the help of Ginette Reno (who plays the Italian mom), the parents create some humorous melodrama in the process of "adapting" to their son's coming out. A noteworthy performance is also given by Claudia Ferri who plays Angelo's neurotic but understanding sister.  Expect this movie to tackle the subject light-heartedly. It will give you a few laughs, while not being annoyingly thought provoking.
