 I put my philosophical brain to rest and intended to just go along with the thrill ride of this movie however the ride just wasn't very exciting or adventurous. Richard Zanuck (who also produced Jaws) just fails to elicit the same fear or cinematic enthusiasm with these giant fire breathing creatures. I can enjoy science fiction with minimal special effects if they are good. The visual special effects of this movie, however were just plain mediocre. Although a dark medieval mood was created, the darkness actually detracted from much of the visual effect. Vivid images of the dragons were lacking and the basic premise of the movie was so severly bland that the special effects just aren't capable of making up for that. The DTS Surround Sound effects were good and the powerplay between characters played by Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale add something worthwhile.  The good surround sound and special visual effects which created enormous, flying, fire breathing dragons just are not enough to raise this movie from the depths of a fiery cinematic hell.
