 Karen Finley unleashes vulgar sarcasm and contempt towards the very society that allows her to publish such profanity, but her messages become loud and clear, only after the initial shock wears off. Her essays illustrate issues of sexual abuse, misogyny and corporate greed (just to name a few) and confront the bitter realities of society that many try hard to deny or keep out of the comfort zone of awareness. This is a raw uncensored cathartic tirade of a woman "checking some major emotional baggage". If you can't handle hearing of harsh realities of life and vulgar words, this book is not for you. I personally, found the profanity somewhat excessive, (minus two stars) and this is a major part of her method here. Some parts made me angry, but other parts had me laughing hysterically. This book is bound to invoke and trigger some strong thoughts and feelings relating to your own issues (if you are willing to admit you have any).  If you can get past the shock of the sensationalized vulgarity and barrage of four letter words & slang body part names without abandoning the book, you will feel the intensity of her angst..(you may even share some). She also includes some humourously vulgar and obnoxious original artwork to add to the 'treatment'. This book will make a great stocking stuffer to instigate any Politically Correct, Ultra Conservative, Right Wing, Anti-Free Speech advocates on your holiday shopping list.
