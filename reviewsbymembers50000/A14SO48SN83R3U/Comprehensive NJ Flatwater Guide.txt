 Although the descriptions of the listings are somewhat short and the b&w photographs for each site don't do them justice, this is a fairly comprehensive listing of NJ flatwater sites.  The guide also includes some nice smaller lakes.  The guidebook is great in providing paddlers with all they need to get to each site and see for themselves the beauty that NJ offers to those who kayak and canoe.  Grab this book and your paddle and get on the water!
