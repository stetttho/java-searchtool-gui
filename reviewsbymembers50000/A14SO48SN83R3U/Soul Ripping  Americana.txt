 Kevin Bowe is another great storyteller. He knows how to craft a song and does it well. Every song on this CD is a finely crafted lyrical treasure of Americana set to a progressive/alt/country style sound.  Although some of Bowe's songs have been a bit overproduced on recordings by guitarist/vocalist Jonny Lang and some other well known artists, Restoration remains a pure testament to his own outstanding musical and lyrical abilities.
