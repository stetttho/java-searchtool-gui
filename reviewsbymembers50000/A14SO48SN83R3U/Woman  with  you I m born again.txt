 Williams scores another series of hits with producer Bob Mathes, in this well-chosen collection of re-makes from the 70's.  Smooth jazz great, George Benson also adds his articulate vocals to two of the tracks which creates a magical vocal synergy. Although some of the renditions don't stray too far from the originals, Williams certainly adds a vocal energy and passion which is truly her own.  With the help of Mathes, the renditions also seem to maintain some of Williams more familiar musical arrangements while showcasing her vocal prowess.  Although her cover of Stevie Wonder's "Send One Your Love" doesn't stray too far, she clearly creates a mood of romance.  She also injects her own soulful and romantic new energy into Al Wilson's "Show And Tell", Carol Bayer Sager's "Midnight Blue", Roberta Flack's "First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" and the seemingly endlessly remade classic "You Are Everything".  The best illustration of the synergy between Williams & Benson is heard on "With You I'm Born Again". The soulful and articulate vocals of both along with the sound of the London Session Orchestra make this track extraordinary.  Williams background vocals are as smoothly ethereal as in the orginal and are sure to give you a sorrowful chill.  Some of the lesser known selections from her musical heroes include Rufus & Chaka Khan's "Everlasting Love" and the Isley Brothers "Harvest For The World".  A duet with James 'D-Train' Williams, "I'll Be Good to Ya", picks up the pace a bit and adds a little funk to the collection.  If you grew up listening to the music of this era, you will appreciate this collection and will enjoy this nostalgic musical journey of love.
