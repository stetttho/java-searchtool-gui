 Great Marketing appears to have drawn the crowd to see this one. Blair Witch offers a creative cinematic perspective however this movie gets lost in a most boring sequence of camping events and one highly annoying female character. The acting is horrible and the plot nothing more than overreactive hysteria to a bunch of freaky nonsense and mind games. The ending is somewhat scary without alot of special effects..but not nearly as scary as it's hyped out to be. I have seen some very creative and scary films without the violence and splatter ... unfortunately, Blair Witch is not one of them.
