 Mariah proves she is a pop diva with no inhibitions about praising her Lord Jesus and sharing her Christmas joy and love in a most intimate and lively way.  God Bless her!   She belts out her most passionate and spirited vocal energy and really lets her gospel hair down on this CD.  Her rendition of "Oh Holy Night" will have tears in your eyes while at the end of the CD,  "Jesus, What A Wonderful Child" will have you  dancing around, throwing your hands in the air praising the Lord, shouting AMEN..and singing along with chills (maybe even if your not a Christian!).  The entire CD will get the  true Christmas Spirit moving through you faster than Santa can come down your chimney and will touch the hearts of even the Grinches among us!  This CD is about feeling and healing.  You will feel the healing energy in the last song as it miraculously wipes out any  seasonal or holiday blues you may have.   The secular favorite "Santa Claus is Comin' to Town" and a very cool, creative and 'peppy' medley of Three Dog Night's "Joy to the World" and the classic Christmas version add to the holiday cheer. This is another contemporary Christmas CD that is destined to become a Christmas classic because of the powerful, passionate, healing energy and upbeat spirited emotion it invokes. (OK Mariah, now how about convincing the record execs to let you add more of your  raw gospel influence to your regular pop albums?)
