 This is essential Thelonious Monk and for those who know little to nothing about jazz but want an introduction, this is an excellent CD to begin the journey.  The combination of Monk's compositions & piano mastery and Charlie Rouse on tenor sax yields creative jazz perfection throughout the entire album.  This remains one of my personal favorites because of the improvisational yet contemplative jazz mood it creates. Faint nuances of Monks improvisational ramblings in the background of some selections add an even more human quality to these already intimate jazz compositions. For serious Monk fans, there is also a VHS video documentary entitled "Straight, No Chaser" which highlights the life of this creative and somewhat mysterious jazz genius.  It also includes some very interesting interviews with Monk and some live concert footage which allow you to see "Mr. Misterioso" at work on his piano.
