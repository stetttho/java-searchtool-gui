 Sting joins jazz pianist & composer Gil Evans and this recording highlights him in the upper range of his artistic and improvisational artistry. The synergy between Evans and Sting seems to help Sting unleash a raw and passionate power and results in a highly savored live performance. Branford Marsalis makes a guest apearance and adds some superb tenor sax work to the performance.  If you enjoy the jazz of Gil Evans, the vocals of Sting and some music from his Police days,  you will triple your listening pleasure with this great import which was recorded during a live performance at an Italian Jazz festival back in 1987. The jazz aficionados will detect a few flaws, however the performance remains a well worthwhile and pleasurable listening experience.
