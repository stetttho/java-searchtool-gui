 This is no solemn religious Christmas music.  This is Ella at her Christmas finest in a festively  jazzy collection of swinging and be-boppin' Christmas classics including, Jingle Bells, Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, Sleigh Ride and Let It Snow.  This is a great CD to acquaint young ones to Ella Fitzgerald and to the swing and big band sounds of jazz.  Don't be surprised if they start singing along! She slows it down, but just a bit,  on a few sultry selections including Good Morning Blues, What Are You Doing New Year's Eve, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,  White Christmas  and The Christmas Song.   A great selection of classic and festive Christmas songs, Ella's articulate lyrics and her sultry swinging vocals make this CD a great addition to any Holiday music collection.
