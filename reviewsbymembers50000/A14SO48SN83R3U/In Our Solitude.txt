 I agree with Storr that contemporary Western culture can make peace and solitude difficult to attain.  In this book he examines why this occurs.  Storr's 'Solitude' makes a philosphical and psychological examination of the therapeutic value of isolation,  its effect on imagination, creativity, self actualization and general well being.  It also highlights implications of extreme forms and discusses the benefit in times of grief, loss and suffering. Storr illustrates his ideas with some  rich examples and quotes from famed artists, writers, composers and other creative people regarding how their creative processes, works, temperaments and lives have been influenced by their solitude or by their lack thereof. While highlighting the creative utility and positive contributions of solitude on the 'self', this book in no way devalues the need for  relationships.  I like the idea that solitude is rather, part of a process which by making us more authentic, makes our relationships with others and our world more genuine and satisfying.
