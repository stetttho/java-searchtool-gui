 Well this is a long way from Jethro Tull's Aqualung,  but if such a thing as musical perfection exists, this Ian Anderson creation exemplifies it.  On this CD, Anderson uses his musical creative genius to take us to a magical,  mystical and multicultural instrumental celebration.  Divinities  is a transcendental musical journey which  transcends space,  time and categorization. The sound is largely high spirited classical with a  natural and meditative nuance of new age.  With these,  and Anderson's superb flute playing,  Ian  transports us into diverse spiritual traditions and allows us to 'tune in' to the universal  flow of a higher realm of consciousness.. a  seemingly natural musical connection with our Divine Being, ourselves and the cosmos.      In Divinities, Anderson captures the essence of a Tao of music with his creative orchestrations, compositions and flute playing..and with some engineering and production help from Jethro Tull partner Andrew Giddings.
