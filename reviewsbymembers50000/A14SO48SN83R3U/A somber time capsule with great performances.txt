 Although this DVD is almost two hours long, it seems to end too fast.   An all star cast of celebrities weave stories which capture the tragedy, courage & heroism of September 11, 2001 in between a number of great musical performances. Although it's presented in a telethon format, this is a very touching concert and tribute.   The brief stories, which are both tragic and inspirational will bring tears to your eyes while the musical performances are delivered with a somber intensity which vividly captures the essence of the mood of America during this very difficult time.  The musical performances are just awesome. Most of the artists reworked their songs just for this telethon and the result is a creatively touching musical tribute.
