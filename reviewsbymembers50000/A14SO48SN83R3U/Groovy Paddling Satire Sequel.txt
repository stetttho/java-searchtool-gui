 You must be a paddler (or at least paddled once)  to appreciate William Nealy's zany little collection of humorous sketches and creative cartoons.  This collection includes unsolicited advice on paddling, epic adventures, another parody of  outdoor equipment advertisements (S&M River Supplies),  the "S&M Campfire Songbook"  featuring the lyrics to "my Boat" (set to the music of "my Guy") and a host of other funny little penned paddling sketches and comics which, most likely,  came right out of Nealy's river sketchbook. It's a  groovy  little book and another cool thing to pass around on camping/paddling trips to get some laughs by the campfire.
