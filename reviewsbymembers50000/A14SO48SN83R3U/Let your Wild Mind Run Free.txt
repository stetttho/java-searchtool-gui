 Another great book  about writing for those who are just starting  to write or those who feel their  creative reservoir approaching drought.  Natalie Goldberg continues to combine her Zen approach and casual style  in these short and easily digestible essays, each with its own suggested exercise for getting your wild mind to flow as fast as your wild hand and pen can keep pace.  I used this book as the foundation for a local writing group which has helped some new writers 'bloom like a lotus'.  It is the recipe for  living the writer's life and  it has flavorfully seasoned a few veteran writers and also kept  the group's creative river flowing freely and unobstructed.
