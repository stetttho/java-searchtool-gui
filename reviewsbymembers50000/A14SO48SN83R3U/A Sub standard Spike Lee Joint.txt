 Given this was a Spike Lee Joint, my expectations were higher for this movie.  This is definitely not one of Spike's better films but in SOS, Spike strays from his usual racial discourse to a portrayal of the universal dualities of human nature and the "shadows" of the human psyche.  This theme is highly intriguing and well worth exploring, however Spike's plot gets lost in a barrage of vulgarity, graphic sex, violence and splatter.  SOS is a musical and visual montage of the period and realistically captures the fear, hysteria and paranoia of the time.  The cinematography, at least, is well within expectation. Michael Badalucco  (Jimmy from ABC's "The Practice") is eerily humorous as the innerly tormented David Berkowitz however this film is not about the 44 caliber killer but rather the impact of the 1977 murders on individuals, a community and society at large.
