 Ms Baker's jazzy vocals are superb on this collection of Christmas favorites. With the help of George Duke, Larry Carlton, Joe Sample and The Yellowjackets, the selections are extremely well crafted and fun. Spiritual selections include God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen and O Come All Ye Faithful.   In addition to the previously mentioned classics,there are two other gems on this collection. They include Frosty's Rag and Christmas Fantasy which is a smooth Anita Baker original.   Christmas Fantasy offers nothing extremely groundbreaking as far as Christmas music, but the music is good and Baker's vocals continue to impress.  Christmas Fantasy is definitely a worthwhile addition for loyal Baker and smooth jazz fans.
