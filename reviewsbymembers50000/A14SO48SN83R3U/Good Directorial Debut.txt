 Zach Braff puts forth a noble effort in his writing/directorial debut. He develops interesting and mildly quirky characters, but unfortunately, they are left to support only an adequate plot involving themes of love, death and "what am I going to do with my life" angst.  The plot, much like the characters, seemed to be in a stage of twenty-something limbo. If it was intentional, I don't think it worked in the manner it was intended and managed to dull some of the luster from the shining characters.  Beyond the plot weakness, Braff does a good job of acting the emotionally numb lead role while Natalie Portman (whose previous acting I don't care for) gives her best performances to date in the supporting role. Their characters initially, are on two opposite ends of spectrum. His character is numb and emotionally distant while hers is supersensitive.  Somehow, a romance seems to bring them together and balance them out a bit before the story ends.  There's also some interesting but subtle commentary and insight which illustrates the potential overuse and mis-use of both recreational and professionally prescribed drugs.  The cinematography, visual imagery and soundtrack also do a good job of keeping this movie slightly above average.  The soundtrack featuring Coldplay and The Shins does an excellent job at capturing the mood of the generation-X angst. It's a melodic blend of mild indie-pop, rock and alt-country. Many generation x'ers seem to have enjoyed the soundtrack more than the film itself.  The documentary about the making of the film is also worth watching.  Overall, Garden State is a good directorial debut for Braff and one worth, at least, the cost of a rental.
