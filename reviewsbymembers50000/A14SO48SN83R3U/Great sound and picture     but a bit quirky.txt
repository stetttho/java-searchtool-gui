 The design is ultra sleek & contemporary and the sound and picture are indeed remarkable for a home theater in a box system. I love playing home made picture discs like a slide show. This system makes that very easy to do.  As stated by the previous reviewers, there are a few little glitches in this system that need to be resolved before my rating for this system increase to 5 stars.  *  The carousel does take a bit too long to load.  It's not very long, but longer than other systems, and long enough to be noticable and slightly annoying.  *  I'm not a tekkie but the system that reads the discs has occasional trouble reading home burned CDs when the same CDs play fine on other older and lower end players. I thought it may have been a defect in my unit, however a replacement unit responds the same way.  *  While a disc is playing, you cannot change, insert or eject a disc without interrupting the one currently playing.  By themselves, these small factors may not be a big deal for most consumers and certainly don't detract from the quality of the sound or the picture once a disc is playing.   If you are more performance oriented, the combined problematic issues make a great video and audio system seem only adequate.
