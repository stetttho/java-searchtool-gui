 Although I'm a collector of most of the older classic Christmas albums, this CD ranks high on my list of spiritual holiday music and is destined to become a treasured holiday classic in the years to come.  Vanessa's interpretations of some classic spiritual Christmas songs such as "What Child is This", "Hark the Herald Angels Sing", "Do You Hear What I Hear/Little Drummer Boy", "Angels We have Heard on High" and the "First Noel" are soulfully jazzy. A very upbeat medley of "Go Tell it on the Mountain/Mary had a Baby" produced by David Foster adds a somewhat contemporary gospel sound which will give you chills and also remarkebly illustrates her extended vocal range. Her solemn rendition of "Gracious Good Shepherd" features her daughter in a vocal solo and allows the listener to really feel the reason for the season.  Every song beautifully captures true spirit of the Christmas season. This CD will warm your heart.
