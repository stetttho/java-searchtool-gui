 Deep Writing does not require deep reading.  It is an easy read and although it offers very practical  ideas and strategies, it is far more than a practical  "how to" writing guide.   I highly recommend it for beginning writers and those seasoned writers who are experiencing a  loss of momentum, flow, focus or  blocks to creativity.  Deep Writing will  give you the tools to get you started on meaningful & purposeful writing  in addition to helping you remove any  roadblocks to passionate and genuine writing.  While helping you enjoy the process of writing,  Maisel (who is also a psychotherapist)  also helps the you along the process of  'knowing yourself' better.  Some case vignettes of writers and artists he has helped along the way richly add to the utility of his ideas.
