 Although released in 1989,  Flying Cowboys remains one of my favorite musical pieces in my entire collection of CDs and definitely one of the most essential in Jone's discography. It's high on my list of must haves if I was to be stranded on the immortal "desert isle".   Jones has always been a talented songwriter and always had a creative knack for telling her musical tales using vivid characters and lush musical arrangements.  With some help from producer/songwriter/musician Walter Becker (from Steely Dan), she scores big on this project. The end result here is a mostly upbeat, poetic & jazzy collection of folk/pop with the exception of "Ghost Train". Although "Ghost Train" doesn't seem to fit into the mood of the whole, it is one of my favorites. It works extremely well in illustrating Jone's talent at more bluesier vocals and her overall versatility.  From the ethereal "The Horses" to the calypso tinged "Love is Gonna Bring Us Back Alive", the other selections are upbeat, smoothly poetic and mildly romantic. Smooth jazz artist Vonda Shephard (from the Allie McBeal series soundtrack)and jazz great Randy Brecker also perform on a couple of selections.  For those not familiar with Rickie Lee Jones, I highly recommend Flying Cowboys.
