 In A Love Supreme, John Coltrane shares his spiritual awakening in the voice of his tenor sax.  It is an extraordinary and inspirational  jazz masterpiece which has been in part, responsible for my  own journey into the world of jazz music.  Coltrane is a true jazz saint and by listening to the four pieces on this CD, you will understand why.  Along with Coltrane, McCoy  Tyner on piano, Jimmy Garrison on bass and Elvin Jones on drums make rich,  beautiful and soulful music together.  In addition, the solos are intense and trancelike.   If you want to begin a journey into jazz....open this door.  No Jazz collection should be without this masterpiece.
