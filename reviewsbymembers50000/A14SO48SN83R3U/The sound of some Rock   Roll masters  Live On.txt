 On the band's 3rd album, Kenny Wayne Shepherd continues to play  some wicked electric guitar and  prove he  is a great songwriter too. Influenced by  the styles of Stevie Ray Vaughn, Clapton, Hendrix, and the Allman Bros,  this kid's rock & roll blues are  raw, loud and generally highly charged.  He even throws a few very well written ballads in the mix  here.  This is my type of rock & roll.  Lead vocalist Noah Hunt, who has a voice beyond his years, adds to the jam, and  together these guys rock throughout the entire CD.  Although the CD is energetic, it doesn't even come close to the energy these boys generate in concert.  (I'll reserve their five star rating for their release of a live album).  Buy the CD first, THEN see them live. The released singles "In Too Deep" and "Last Goodbye" are good but I like the intensity of the  lyrics and the jam on a  song called "Was" which features Kenny on a steel guitar.  I'm hoping this song is the next released single.   I consider the music these guys play a tribute to some of the great rock & roll masters and Kenny Wayne certainly has the creative energy  to sustain this musical blend of rock & roll blues.  More studio time, time on the road and years of experience will allow their own individual style to evolve, so they can take the music where some of their influences didn't live to take it.
