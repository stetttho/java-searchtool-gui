 Following the concepts he presents  in  The Science of Homeopathy, theorist George Vithoulkas presents a new paradigm ofhealth and illness that goes beyond Western medicine's limited view of the  human organism and the true sources of  disease.  This book is required reading for anyone having an academic or clinical  interest in homeopathy and for those interested in the science and theory of a truly holistic oriented approach to illness and health.  Although this book might be somewhat difficult to comprehend and digest for the layperson, it's well worth the challenging read. In this text, Vithoulkas relates many of our current diseases such as cancer, aids, asthma, epilepsy, schizophrenia and dementia (along with many others) to the weakening of the immunity system and discusses the role of the overprescription of drugs such as antibiotics in this process. I agree with Vithoulkas.  Only when Western medicine  incorporates homeopathic principles into its system and integrates the role of the psyche, spirit and emotions into theories of illness and health can we begin to develop more holistic forms of treatment.
