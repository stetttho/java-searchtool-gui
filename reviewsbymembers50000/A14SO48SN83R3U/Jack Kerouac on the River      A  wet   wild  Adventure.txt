 This is one of the best pieces of fiction I have read in a long time and will get your juices flowing faster than a class V rapid. It's the male version of the Harlequin Romance Novel. It's a raw, primitive adrenaline and testosterone pumping journey down an uncharted fictional river and the antics and drama that unfold when the 'boys meet the girls' in their kayaks and rafts on the river..and how they are' transformed' along the way. There's no Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon on this river. The characters, plot and setting are richly developed and erotically intertwined.  Parts of the book had me on the edge of my seat, while others had me laughing out loud (which had fellow commuters on my train wondering what I was reading). Beyond it's rich detailing of some of the technical aspects of whitewater river running, this is a story about a quest of mind, body and spirit on the river of life.
