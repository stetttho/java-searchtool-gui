 If you are a  coastal paddler who plans to visit the area near the Outer Banks of North Carolina, you will not want to be without this guide. Pam Malec has compiled an excellent trip planning guide with over 30 day trip paddle plans.  Each listing has a general map of the route and describes the required skill level for the trip, wildlife & landmarks of the area, launching and landing sites, safety issues, navigational aids, and camping, lodging & restaurant options.  Each trip description also includes a page  of local lore (including one about an attack swan!) which really adds to the depth of the guide and to each individual trip.   A chapter on the best kayak surfing spots in the area, safety and surf etiquette and appendices listing local events & paddling clubs, recommended reading, paddlesport rental/ instruction/outfitters, National  & State Parks, reserves and refuges really make this an excellent and comprehensive regional paddling guide.
