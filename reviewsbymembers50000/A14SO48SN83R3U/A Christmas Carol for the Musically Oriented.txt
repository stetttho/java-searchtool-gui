 A witty, musical new twist on the old classic, this VH1 production casts Vanessa Williams as a miserly and grinchy "Ebony Scrooge,". Ebony was once part of a popular 80s singing trio, but after one of the trio is killed in an auto accident, Ebony embarks on a solo career characterized by extreme narcissism and greed.  While in New York for a "charity" concert, designed to benefit no one but herself, Ebony is visited by four spirits who want to make her change her wicked ways.  Suddenly Susan's Kathy Griffin gives a noteworthy performance as the sarcastic, tongue and cheek spirit of Christmas Past. Also making appearances are TLC's Chilli, John Taylor from Duran Duran, Brian McKnight and Nile Rogers. Williams acting isn't the most fluid but her singing is superb.  Her articulate vocals in the Christmas songs she sings in this movie provide some great "built in" holiday music videos. The "Sleigh Ride" sequence will quickly get you into the holiday spirit and the "Heartquake" sequence provides some humorous musical 80's nostaligia.  Vanessa Williams holiday musical numbers from this movie would make a great Christmas soundtrack and I'm very surprised VH 1 hasn't already released and marketed it.  Overall, those who love music, Christmas and/or the vocals of Vanessa Williams, will enjoy this fun remake of a treasured holiday classic.
