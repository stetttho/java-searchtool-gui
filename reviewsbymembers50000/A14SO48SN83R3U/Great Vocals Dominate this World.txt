 On "Wander this World", Jonny's 2nd album with A&M records, his voice continues to age exponentially, giving him the vocal power of a black blues vocalist well into his 40's as evidenced on the hit single "Still Rainin'". His raspy aged voice however seems to overpower his guitar playing, which should also be evolving. On this album, Jonny also proves his ability to co-write some great lyrics to accompany his passionate vocals. Among the other selections on "Wander this World", Jonny demonstrates some diversity in his style by adding a little funk most evident on "I Am" (written by Prince) and "Before You Hit the Ground". Some background vocalists on a few selections also add to the soulful mood.  My favorite songs off this album just happen to be co-written by Jonny and Kevin Bowe. They include a somewhat slow but rawly emotional ballad called "Breakin Me" and a bluesy anthem called "Leaving to Stay". These songs passionately resonate the intensity of Jonny's blues like no others on the album.
