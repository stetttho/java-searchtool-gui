 I usually enjoy Kevin Bacon and Charlize Theron but 'Trapped' is how I felt watching this movie. On more than one occasion I was tempted to turn it off but to give it a fair shot I reluctantly sat through its entirety. Even with suspension of any serious expectations, the movie is at most, just minimally entertaining.  The character development is incomplete and in some cases lacking altogether which makes them all very bland. The characters are also very annoying. This is one movie where you almost cheer for the bad guys to do something horrible.   Kevin Bacon appears bored and uninvolved in his role and seems to indicate that the 'strange dude' typecast just isn't working for him anymore. He needs to move on. Charlize Theron gives a good performance but the horrible script weighs her down. A noble effort is also made by Courtney Love who also seems encumbered by the bad script.  Unfortunately, the ludicrous script only gets worse as the plot thickens to a consistency of green pea soup that has been sitting on the kitchen table for weeks. Get the idea? This movie stinks.  Although filled with some unbelievable (in the silliest sense) action, the 'finale' was laughable and predictable ... but mostly long awaited.  If you want to see Kevin Bacon as a more believable bad guy, 'The River Wild' is a better choice.
