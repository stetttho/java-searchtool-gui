 This deluxe set includes the audio cd in addition to the DVD.   I really respect and enjoy the music of Ray Charles so I hate to give this a somewhat low rating, but the overall quality of the DVD production is disappointing. If you don't dig the gospel roots from which Ray Charles sprouted, then you may not like this DVD at all.  In addition, the "forced" commercials in the beginning are so annoying that the frustration with this DVD begins even before the actual concert starts.  Much of the beginning of this concert is primarily the Voices of Jubilation performing spirit filled selections of praise and worship. If you enjoy Ray Charles AND gospel music (which I do), then there is some redeeming grace(no pun intended). If Ray Charles wasn't such a musical legend and I didn't like gospel music, I might've rated this DVD with only 1 star.  Once the concert begins, the Voices of Jubilation play for quite some time before Ray Charles finally comes out to perform. After singing a few Christmas songs he then takes another long break before returning again, this time thankfully, for a longer set and ultimately, a heartwarming encore of "America the Beautiful". Despite his obvious ailing, his strong spirit seems to allows him to smile and jam on his piano throughout.  In this performance, Ray brings his own personal jazzy, blues interpretations to some popular Christmas songs and adds a few inspirational songs of praise and worship. Don't expect to hear "Hit the Road Jack" or ""Georgia" or many of the others which made him famous.  The Voices of Jubilation, however, do a good job of keeping the spirit moving in between Ray's sets and throughout the duration of the DVD.
