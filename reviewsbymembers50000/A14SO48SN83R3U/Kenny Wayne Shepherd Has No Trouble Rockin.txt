 Trouble Is starts the jam with a KWS original called called "Slow Ride" however this CD is anything but slow. Shepherd's lyrics and masterful guitarwork combined with Noah Hunt's powerfully articulate vocals deliver a passionately energetic blend of southern tinged rock and blues. Originals such as Slow Ride, Somehow Somewhere Someway, I Found Love and the popular Blue on Black prove the Shepherd/Hunt combination works extremely well. Also included are versions of Hendrix's "I Don't Live Today" and an excellent version of Dylan's "Everything is Broken". My other favorites are "Long Gone" (which is reminiscent ofearly Rolling Stonesblended  with the blues of Stevie Ray Vaughn), King's Highway and a well crafted ballad called I Found Love When I Found You.
