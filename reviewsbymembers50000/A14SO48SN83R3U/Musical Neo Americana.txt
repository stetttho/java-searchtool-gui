 I was new to Bill Frisell and after reading some reviews and listening to the sound clips on Amazon, I purchased this CD. I have absolutely NO regrets.  Although I am not a huge fan of country or bluegrass music, Blues Dream is a delightfully progressive fusion of those, along with a healthy portion of folk, rock and blues added.  The resultant sounds paint relaxing (and sometimes hypnotic) sketches of a musical Neo Americana.   Blues Dream is a progressive 'jazz-like' fusion of a few musical styles, but one which never fails to lose the sound, or the mood, of it's traditional American roots.
