 Unfortunately, it's prelude to a war and all its atrocities that gives us an in depth and informative look at the Al-Jazeera television network and the attitudes towards America from the Arab world.  There are a number of characters and events in this documentary that will invoke a variety of feelings including sadness, affection, pity, and rage. Although the context of the documentary is the media coverage of a war, there are still some moments of humor. I chuckled during some segments and came close to crying on others. The emotional intensity is high.  The allegation of the 'staging' of the crowd toppling over the statue of Saddam Hussein should make you think about just how far perceptions can be swayed by those in power manipulating news broadcasts and visual images. It also makes one more critical of believing something to be a "truth", just because we saw it on a television news program.   The killing of an Al-Jazeera reporter in one of the first "shock and awe" blasts rightfully creates great sadness and tension among those interviewed from the Al Jazeera station. You can also understand how hard 'objective' reporting from the remaining staff at Al-Jazeera must be after that incident.  The much larger question always remains if "objective" reporting is possible at all. Chances are, if both sides of a controversial issue are irritated with the media coverage, the reporting is being done as objectively and effectively as possible. The truth is often very hard to swallow from both sides.  The notion of banning certain graphic war images on American news broadcasts also makes one wonder what purpose censorship serves.    If we are to truly learn from history, Control Room proposes the truth must be told without censorship and without the candy coating.  I hope Control Room finds its way into our high school history curriculum.
