 I've only had..and enjoyed  this book for over 10 years, and since I'm not out paddling,  thought it was time to write the first review for it. William Nealy shares his politically incorrect and  very humorous, sociocultural paddling wit and commentary  in comic sketch form.  It  includes tips on "how to pick up a river person", River Accessories from S&M river Supplies (featuring Wanda the inflatable boat b**ch),  an examination for a whitewater doctorate from S&M University of Whitewater Sciences, and many other outrageous and creative little paddling comic strip sketches and tales.   "Kayaks to Hell" is a satirical perspective on the whitewater  paddling psyche and  a  "must have" for all dry-bags.
