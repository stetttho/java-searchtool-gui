 Hal Lingerman does a  good job at defining classical music pieces to relieve tension, boredom, grief anxiety and depression, and those compositions which might help one relax, meditate or pray.  He also gives quite  a menu for musical pieces to give strength and courage, facilitate clear thinking and release anger.    Unfortunately, beyond mostly classical music, other genres of music are either omitted altogether or are severely underrepresented.  He does however include a chapter representing some world music, women's music and the music of nature.  An interesting chapter on personality temperaments, musical preference and the elements of fire, water, air and earth is also included but not enough to save this book from a severe lack of diversity in musical style.   After a chapter that basically bastardizes rock and roll, it becomes clear that Lingerman (who is also a minister) is on his own subtle musical pulpit.  The music he preaches and advocates is without a doubt, slanted towards the classical genre and angelic in nature.   Jazz compositions are virtually omitted altogether. A good book for those with a preference for  receiving the healing energy of classical music.
