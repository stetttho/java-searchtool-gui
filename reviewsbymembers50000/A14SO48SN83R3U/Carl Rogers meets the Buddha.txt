 I highly recommend this book for anyone who practices psychotherapy and  who truly wants to be 'engaged' in a genuine process  with their clients.   Zen and the Heart of Psychotherapy uncovers a process of mutual growth and  transformation that can occur for both the client AND the therapist using  basic Zen  principles and ideas. This book does not get encumbered in  Eastern ambiguity or unnecessary and technical Buddhist semantics.   Regardless of your or your client's spiritual belief system, the ideas  presented can be considered universally and are useful in not only forging  a strong therapeutic alliance in the here and now, but also for faciliating  growth, transformation and healing of mind, body and spirit.
