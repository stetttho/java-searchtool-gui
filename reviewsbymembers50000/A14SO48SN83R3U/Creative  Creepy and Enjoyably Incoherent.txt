 This movie creeps you in a subtle but creative way. It doesn't splatter buckets of blood or show graphic gore but the visual images are still haunting and greatly add to a mostly intriguing plot.  Although it boasts no major casting, the acting works sufficiently. The DTS surround sound effects were only minimal and unfortunately, greatly under-utilized. Increased surround effects could have greatly complemented the visual montage and made this movie even more chilling. Reminiscent of 'The Sixth Sense', 'The Ring' also features another overly serious and sensitive child character who seems to sense death. The dark and bizarre visual images will remind you of music video images by Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson and function well in setting up a mood of gloom, suspense and dread. 'The Ring' frightens but also leaves you with many unanswered questions. Since it is generally entertaining, the incoherence of the film isn't fully realized until you are done watching it. If you don't mind pondering questions and forming your own conclusions after the movie, the incoherence is entertaining and chillingly provocative.
