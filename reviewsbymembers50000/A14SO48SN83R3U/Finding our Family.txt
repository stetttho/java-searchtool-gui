 Like a rollercoaster, Latter Days definitely has its ups and downs. There may be some periods you may be tempted to stop the ride and get off, but if you decide to hang on until the end, you probably will enjoy the ride.  The movie takes a good theme and characters but unfortunately throws them into a generally horrible script. CJ Cox seems to have more talent for writing lyrics and wrote many of the songs for the very inspiring soundtrack but the plot suffers some sporadic but severe deficits;  The romance between the two main characters moves too fast to be believable as truly intimate.  There are also way too many gay cliches which unfortunately detract from the integrity of the film. Some of the dialogue is also just plain cheesy however there are a few moments of humor to make you forget the utterly ridiculous parts of the script.  Steve Sandvoss shines in his role as does Wes Ramsey. Jacqueline Bisset also plays a supporting role.  Although the closing message seems to be spoon fed, Bisset's table dialogue at the end of the movie adds a very inspirational redeeming quality to the script.   Her sage-like wisdom in the end ultimately makes the intentions of the director much clearer and makes the sometimes torturous ride seem worthwhile.
