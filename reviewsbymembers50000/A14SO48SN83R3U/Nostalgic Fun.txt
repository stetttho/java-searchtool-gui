 After recently finding a copy of this childhood treasure in my attic, I was reminded of how much I loved having this story read to me as a child.    This book was read to me over 30 years ago. Ironically, I was even able to recite Tikki's entire full name without having to peer inside the book.   Talk about lasting impressions!  This is a great classic for parents to read to their young children and there is something very warm and appealing about about the story, and the simple illustrations that will captivate your child's heart.  It's refreshing to see that this enjoyable book is still available and being read to children.
