 On this, Jonny's 2nd album (first on a major record label), he seems to have lost some of the 'Big Bang' energy and vigor from his original independently released CD. He continues to draw from a number of blues influences including Albert Collins and BB King, but on this album, he has the advantage of some major label production to help him express his blues. He also uses his aged beyond his years voice to belt out a few well chosen covers including renditions of Sonny Boy Williamson's "Good Morning Little School Girl" and Ike Turner's "Matchbox".  Jonny's musical/vocal styles and energy level remains fairly constant throughout this album and the selections written by Bruce McCabe, including "Rack 'em Up", "Darker Side" and the title track heat up the set quite a bit and help make a succesful debut for Jonny on this major label.
