 The previous review is accurate but a bit unfair. You cannot expect a High Definition TV to deliver high definition quality picture to television broadcasts or other input sources like DVD when those sources do not offer high definition resolution.  For broadcasts which are offered in high definition, the color and clarity of image produced is spectacular. Some people who have seen programs on this set assume it's a plasma and are surprised to hear that it's not.  Some have even said certain programs appear to have a 3-d quality.  The quality of the HD is that good.  Of course, the exterior is not as thin as a plasma set however for the size of the television, it's still thinner than most units.  Overall, this is a great HD unit for the price.  If you are not willing to spend the extra cash on a plasma set but want a great HD picture, this unit will meet  your needs.
