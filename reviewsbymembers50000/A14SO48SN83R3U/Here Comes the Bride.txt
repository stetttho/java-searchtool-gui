 This is the best of the vintage Universal Studio monster movies and a sequel even better than its predecessor.  This movie made the phrase  "The Bride of... "  somewhat of a  trademark for many  spoofs and sequels in the horror movie genre and in general.   The black humor,  religious symbolism, climactic ending (complete with a musical bridal march score) and even the hokey backgrounds where you can see the shadows  of the villagers on the painted, studio backdropped sky as they search for the Frankenstein monster make this movie an unforgettable experience.  A few laughs are added by Una O'Connor,  who plays Minnie, the shrilly and annoying but likable servant of Dr. Frankenstein and the village drama queen. For those with a tendency or desire to look deeper  into this movie, there is plenty to ponder.  Although originally released in the 1935, the  themes of life and death eerily  foreshadow  some increasingly  controversial contemporary issues in our society  (genetic cloning maybe??)  and subtley implicate technology as the source of some age old dilemmas  (can technology replace humanity?) which are likely to persist.  Beyond the classic horror apeal, this movie is also rich in emotion.  The scenes where the monster befriends the blind hermit and the  later rejection by his newly created bride add the most touching elements to this classic  "horror" movie and also add a very human quality to the 'monster'.   Monsters have feelings too ... and this is evident throughout some other parts of the movie.   You just can't help empathizing with the monster at times, which make the character and this movie so unforgettable. **For real laughs, check out  Mel Brooks version of "Young Frankenstein" which is an entertaining spoof of this vintage tale.   A more serious  80's remake of the original "Bride of Frankenstein"  was also released and simply called "The Bride" which starred Sting and Jennifer Beals.
