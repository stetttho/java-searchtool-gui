 One thing you can expect from Sting among his various solo works is diversity of musical style. Don't expect the rapid tempo sounds of the Police, although on a few selections, a well listened Police fan will hear faint nuances of the old days. Nothing Like the Sun was originally released in '87 and this work reflects a more 'musically matured' and witty Sting setting his highly articulate lyrics to very palatable form of smooth, sophisticated blend of jazzy rock. This cd features the smooth jazz sax greatness of Branford Marsalis throughout and some selections feature some other well known musical guests on guitar such as Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, and former Police-man Andy Summers. In addition, jazz great Gil Evans and his orchestra jazz it up with Sting on a rendition of Hendrix's "Little Wing". Of all Sting's solo works to date, Nothing LIke the Sun remains one of my personal favorites because of the somberly romantic but upbeat mood he creates with his cerebral lyrics and an eclectic blend of jazz and rock.
