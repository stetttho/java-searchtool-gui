 I'm another one who has waited a very  long time for this nostalgic feature to be released to video.   This film illustrates the true spirit of Christmas in a multi-act live drama/play form.  It's not about the gifts that are bought, wrapped and boxed but rather the gifts of the spirit and the heart.    It's a real tear jerker about a family and the power of Christmas gifts of  love, compassion and understanding (remember those?)  in a time of holiday grief.  Excellent performances by  Lisa Lucas, Mildred Natwick and Jason Robards as the "Grinchy",  sour and  emotionally distant father. In additon to excellent acting and a heart warming story, this movie is also very well presented.  There are some very artistic, yet simple  visual transitions that separate each act as the narrator recounts her story  of a  Christmas so memorable.  The painted pictures and real life image transitions creatively bring this story to life and also capture the memories for all generations to enjoy during the holiday season and all year round. You will feel the empathic power of this holiday treasure.... and even more  if you have ever  lost someone you loved.  If you have any Grinches in your family, this is the perfect gift.
