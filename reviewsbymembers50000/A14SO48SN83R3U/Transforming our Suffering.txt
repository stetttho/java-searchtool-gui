 Of all the books I have read and enjoyed by Thich Nhat Hanh, this is the one of the most comprehensive, inspiring and practical.   His introduction to the Four Noble Truths is simply written,  easy to understand, and yet lacks not one bit in depth.  Like all his books,  this one helps us to integrate Buddhist ideas into our everyday life without becoming too encumbered with terminology.  Although Thich Nhat Hanh does tend to repeat himself in subtle ways, within this book and across his other books, The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching seems to integrate many of his ideas into one very coherent and practical treatise on the nature suffering as one of the most basic human conditions we spend our lives trying to accept, or possibly escape. He makes the Buddhist concepts of attachment to objects and people very clear in  relationship to human suffering and then highlights the path of well-being, peace and liberation from it.   If I was stuck on an island and could bring a few books, this would be one at the top of the list.  It's a reminder that much our our suffering is self created and an illusion.  In the same way we imprison ourselves mentally, is the way we begin to liberate ourselves.  Freedom and liberation come from within and are possible even under the most extreme, excruciating and trying conditions. I highly recommend this book, and especially to those who are having difficulty dealing with the loss of a loved one (or loss in general) and those who are imprisoned mentally (with fear), or even physically incarcerated.
