 This is another great rock'n one from Pat's 80's archive.  Although the radio friendly Shadows of the Night and Little Too Late satisfy the pop seeking audience, the highlights here are the ones which were never released as singles and just happen to be written by Pat and her hubby Neil Geraldo.   On this album, which followed Crimes of Passion and Precious Time, she continued to belt out hits about the trauma, heartache and passion of looking for and falling in and out of love.  Pat's vocal range and integrity remain at its best throughout this project.   "Fight It Out" has some awesome lyrics which Pat belts out in the most passionate and articulate way. Her operatic background peeks out on this somewhat angry ballad as she hits some of her higher notes while Neil shows off his excellence on guitar.  Pat's articulate, passionate and highly energetic vocals continue on "The Victim", I'll Do It" and "I Want Out" and "Tell It to her". The angry love theme also continues throughout the lyrics of these great songs.  Those looking for Pat's mellower sounds of peace, tranquility and contentment will have to look later in her catalog.  Expect to rock with this one!
