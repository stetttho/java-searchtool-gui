 I really don't think any Christmas music collection could be complete without this soundtrack.  When I think back of my childhood and watching the Charlie Brown Christmas Special on CBS during the holidays, I can't help but remember the warm feeling that Vince Guaraldi's arrangements instilled in me while watching the special.  Looking back now, I also think that this soundtrack music was my first memorable exposure to jazz and probably set the stage for my musical appeal to instrumental jazz.    "Christmas Time is Here"  has become a Holiday jazz standard and has been re-recorded by a number of jazz vocalists but my personal favorite is "Skating".   This is the Tao of Christmas.  You can't help but lose yourself in the meditative freedom expressed in this arrangement, like the Peanuts characters in the movie, gliding so freely, smoothly  and gracefully on the frozen pond in the pristine greyness of winter.   If you grew up watching the Peanuts during Christmas, this CD takes you back to that place in your childhood  Christmas heart.
