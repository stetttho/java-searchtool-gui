 This is one of the earlier Rankin/Bass productions which differs a bit from the traditional Christmas Specials that most of us remembered growing up.  The story is told with a 'new age' twist and is filled with fantasy. It's a mystical tale which brilliantly and simply explains the origins of the immortality of Santa Claus and many of his associated traditions of Christmas. Although it's a bit off the beaten path of holiday classics, The Life and Adventures of Santa Clause captures the essence of some universal themes such as the struggles between good & evil and the nature of humanity. It also includes the typical universal holiday themes of peace, joy and goodwill. This is another holiday favorite that both kids and adults will enjoy.
