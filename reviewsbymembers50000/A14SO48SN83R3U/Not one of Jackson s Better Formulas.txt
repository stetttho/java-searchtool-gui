 Comparing this movie to those of Tarantino and Monte Python give Formula 51 too much credit. "Tarantino on the Thames" this is not. Beyond Samuel Jackson, the only saving grace of this movie is the sexy assassin played by Emily Mortimer. An almost unrecognizable Meatloaf (yes.. the rock singer) also has a small part but adds little to this formula. The plot relies on a very odd and offbeat offering of comedic and at times graphic violence. The plot is old and worn out but the movie however, invokes a few laughs. In many parts you will ask yourself, "what the hell was that all about?". If you like Samuel Jackson you may like it. Be warned however: Formula 51 is definitely NOT one of his best. This is rental entertainment at most.
