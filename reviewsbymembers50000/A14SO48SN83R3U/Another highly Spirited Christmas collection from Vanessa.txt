 Vanessa Williams along with producer Rob Mathes and the London Session Orchestra work well to create another Christmas CD that is destined to become a treasured classic.   This compilation of Christmas cheer contains some great new renditions of the old Christmas classics.  Highlights include a very smooth and mellow version of the title cut, "Joy to the World" with Brian McNight, "The Holly and the Ivy" and a more upbeat and jazzy version of The Carpenter's "Merry Christmas Darling".  On "Winter Weather", Vanessa showcases some of her superb Broadway style vocals.  "December Lullaby" is a smooth jazzy track with superb lyrics and a great musical arrangement which will get your head "be-boppin".  My favorite track off this compilation, however, is Vanessa's rendition of "The Little Drummer Boy".  Vanessa's smooth voice with the added angelic sound of the Broadway Inspirational Voices choir towards the latter portion of this track add some gospel to the mix and will fill you with the spirit of the season. It's purely magical. The choir returns in "Rise Up Shepherd and Follow" which is another highly inspirational track that is sure to lift your spirits.  In Silver and Gold, Vanessa presents us with another very inspirational and jazzy collection of holiday cheer.
