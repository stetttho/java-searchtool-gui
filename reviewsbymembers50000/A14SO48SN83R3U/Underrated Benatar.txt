 This is one of Benatar's most underrated albums. Having generated the commercially successful singles, Invincible and Sex as  Weapon, it's criticized by some as being another commercial sellout.  Listening to the rest of the tracks, it's  clear that this album offers much more musically and lyrically than the 'poppy' radio friendly singles that were produced. Other than the two commercially oriented singles, there is some great songwriting found in the collaboration between Myron Grombacher (Pat's long time drummer) and her guitarist-hubby, Neil Geraldo.
