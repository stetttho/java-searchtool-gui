 This is a jazzy blues yuletide compilation with classic jazz artists such as Chet Baker, Count Basie and Dexter Gordon playing some traditional holiday favorites.  In addition, two versions of an original Thelonious Monk composition called "A Merrier Christmas" are also included.  Contemporary jazz artists such as John Scofield and Benny Green also perform some compositions and vocal tracks by Lou Rawls and Dianne Reeves further add to the overall diversity of this compilation. For those who can appreciate a more melancholic blend of  yuletide jazz & blues,  this is a  great addition to the holiday collection.
