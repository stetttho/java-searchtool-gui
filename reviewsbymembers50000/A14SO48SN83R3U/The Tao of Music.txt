 Storr synthesizes his knowledge of biology, psychology, history  and evolution and fuses it into a  mindful musical journey.  This  is a thought provoking and comprehensive integration of music and the human psyche, and like many of Storr's books, it enhances your self awareness with each chapter. Whether, stimulating &  arousing or  relaxing & calming, music has enormous emotional power.  Storr has written an eloquent treatise on how music serves as one of the bridges connecting mind and body.
