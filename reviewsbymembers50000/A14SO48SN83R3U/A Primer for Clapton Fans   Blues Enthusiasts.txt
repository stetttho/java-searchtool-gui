 Clapton has put together a great primer of the blues with selections ranging  from the acoustic sounds of the rural Delta to the gritty urban sounds of the Chicago blues scene.  This compilation spans the decade from 1970 - 1980 and highlights his blues influences such as Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson.  It also includes an excellent version of Wonderful tonight recorded in 1978 at the Apollo Theatre in Glasgow. If you are a Clapton fan who can handle getting closer to the more subdued roots of his rock & roll, this set will not disappoint.  This compilation is the most comprehensive collection of Clapton's blues recordings to date.
