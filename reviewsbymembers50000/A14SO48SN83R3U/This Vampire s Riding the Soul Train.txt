 Blacula has some very low budget special effects and a few somewhat scary scenes. It also has some hysterical dialogue, funky costumes, groovy funkadelic 70's background music and a disco club scene that could pass itself off as a Soul Train episode. Those into campy, "B" horror movies, should check this flick out.  Blacula is a retro classic that makes a few "offcolor" sociocultural comments and is sure to give you a few good laughs.
