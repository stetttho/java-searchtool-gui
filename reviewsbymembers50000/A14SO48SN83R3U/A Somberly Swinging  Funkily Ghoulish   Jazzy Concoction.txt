 This is a swinging and most eclectic soundtrack to the original Rankin/Bass classic animated movie, Mad Monster Party. Much of the sound is reminscient of the James Bond soundtracks of the era and many of the selections will also appeal to classic jazz and even some Dixieland fans. I love the primitive percussion on "Jungle Madness" and the funky James Brownesque sound of "the Mummy". Phyliss Diller singing "Your Different" is swingingly diabolical. This soundtrack is an excellent way to jazz up your own "Mad Monster" Halloween party. If you can handle indulging yourself in a strange brew of James Bondesque soundtrack music, primitive percussion, battle hymms, some Boris Karloff vocals, and the funky sound of the vibraphone you will truly enjoy this.
