 Keb Mo's original lyrics, passionate & articulate vocals and his simple blend of acoustic guitar blues & folk make this an excellent debut album.  His blues are far from dysphoric as his guitar, harmonica and banjo playing will have you stomping your feet, snapping  your fingers and singing along. In addition to Keb Mo's original songs, the CD also include his versions of Robert Johnson's "Come on in My Kitchen" and "Kindhearted Woman Blues".
