 Although the fast paced development of this area makes a guide such as this very difficult to keep updated and current, this was a much needed revision to the original guides. The history, obstacles, maps & charts, launch & rental sites, approximate paddling times, and grades for each river make this guide ideal for both canoeists and kayakers. Listings for Pinelands preservation and conservation organizations are also included so those who treasure these rivers can support the cause.  If you are paddling in NJ, you won't want to miss at least one of the Pine Barren Rivers and this is the guide you will need.
