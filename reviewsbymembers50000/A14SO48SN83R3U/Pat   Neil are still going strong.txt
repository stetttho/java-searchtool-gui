 "GO" is a return to the power of "In the Heat of the Night" and "Crimes of Passion" with hints of "Tropico".  After some mellow, middle of the road projects, 2 children and years of battling their previous record company, Pat & guitarist-hubby Neil Geraldo have revisited the sound and relationship themes that rocked us in earlier decades. Go illlustrates the evolution and staying power of the rock couple's creative musical collaboration and their marriage.   On this CD and a new record label, Pat and Neil seem to enjoy what they are doing, while also enjoying each other in the process. Neil produced the album while both wrote most of the songs.  The results of this continued partnership is very refreshing both musically and personally for them...and also for us listeners and fans.  In this long awaited return to the rockin' sound of their early works, Neil has turned up his amp, while Pat continues to prove she can still belt out the high notes. This CD contains quite a few high energy selections and some great ballads. Pat articulates them all with her usual vocal prowess, proving she can continue to live in the house of reigning Queens of Rock & Roll.  Go is just plain fun and the ending "Christmas in America" is a patriotic and touching holiday tribute in memory of the 911 attacks.
