 This McDonald collection of holiday music was originally released as "In the Spirit" in 2001.  Christmas albums should fill you with the joy and spirit of the season and this one certainly does.   Although, I'm not much into categorization this music is easily classified as Christian Contemporary. This project is also filled with the sound of the Doobie's, but McDonald does manage to make many of the previously treasured Christmas classics his own. Some notable guest musicians on a few selections include Jonny Lang on lead guitar and James Ingram on vocals. Jazz artist Kirk Whalum also offers up a few outstanding sax solos.  On this project, McDonald has crafted a soulful blend of jazz, blues and gospel which sets the holiday mood and fills you with the Spirit of the Season.
