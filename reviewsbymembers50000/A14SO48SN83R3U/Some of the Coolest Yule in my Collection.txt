 As a collector of Christmas and Holiday CDs I never fully appreciated or understood the "Christmas Blues" theme UNTIL listening to this album. Blues does not mean depressing and Brown makes that clear. These cool, smooth yuletide treats will certainly help get you into the spirit of the season in the most relaxing way.  Brown is responsible for some of our most cherished and classic Christmas blues with his songs being covered from Bon Jovi to BB King. Some may even find his originals to be better than the versions made popular by the mainstream contemporary artists!  I have hundreds of Christmas and Holiday CDs, but this CD remains on  heavy rotation during the season. If you want to get to the root of the Christmas Blues, I highly recommend this smooth, relaxing collection of Christmas grooves.
