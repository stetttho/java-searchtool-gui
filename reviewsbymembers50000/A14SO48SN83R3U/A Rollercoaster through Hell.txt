 The visual images although very creative, will literally make your skin crawl. If you can't handle the grim reality of addiction, this movie is not for you. Set near the Coney Island boardwalk of NY with the backdrop of the world famous Cyclone Rollercoaster, this movie takes your senses along for a thrill ride on an emotional Cyclone as you watch it. This coaster ride of addiction is a one way ride to hell and you have a front row seat.  Although the outcomes of the addictions are the same, I like the general contrast between the young people using the street drugs and the older Ellen Burstyn hooked on her more "socially acceptable" diet pills (which are portrayed as nothing more than a legal form of speed because "the Docta prescribed them!").   Kronos Quartet with their hypnotic fusion of classical, jazz tinged compositions add immensly to the sensory experience of this movie. In addition, excellent acting, especially by Ellen Burstyn, and the creative but graphic & disturbing visual images make this an intense cinematic experience.
