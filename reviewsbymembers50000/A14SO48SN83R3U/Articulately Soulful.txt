 Although I prefer the more 'pure' and less produced live acoustic versions of his songs, this CD clearly illustrates the lyrical and vocal mastery of Jeffrey Gaines. He is articulately soulful. Gaines is a master story teller, creating characters rich in emotion and deeply engaged in living and loving life with all its joys and sorrows. There is something for everyone to relate to in his stories which resonate great emotional intensity. "Shake it Off" is a great tune which sounds like a fusing of Elvis Costello with a tinge of Seal and a mellow Lenny Kravitz. Although many have come to know Gaines from his cover of Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes", and his music reflects a diversity of influence, he clearly forges his own vocal identity and can stand on his own two feet.  See him live if you can.
