 This video ranks 5 stars primarily for nostalgic reasons. If you saw this wacky animated Halloween special on TV any time during your childhood, you will remember the voices of Phyliss Diller and Boris Karloff, the classic monsters, sexy Franceska and the dancing/singing skeleton band in funny Rankin/Bass animated form. You will also remember the corny humor.  For those who have never seen or even heard of "Mad Monster Party", if you saw Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas you will see, and hopefully appreciate, how very "Pre-Burtonesque" this animated feature is.   Reviewers can debate the quality of the animation or the sound or any technical imperfections this movie may have (remember folks..it was 1967), but one thing is for sure, it's a cult classic that kids and adults will still enjoy.  The DVD image restoration shows improvement but it's too bad the sound wasn't  enhanced. The accompanying booklet is also a nice addition to this classic.
