 Papa Claus has a cold, isn't sleeping, has no apetite, is feeling very negative about the holidays and doesn't want to make his Christmas rounds but Mrs. Claus will save the day! She has the perfect remedy for her chubby hubby (no..it's not Prozac...or Viagra!).  This classic Rankin/Bass animated tale surrounds the story of a Christmas that almost wasn't. The jokes are corny but the short, silly vaudeville sequence of the Heat Mizer and the Snow Mizer dancing and singing has made this feature a cherished classic for both children and generations of adults. (I'm waiting for a live action Hollywood remake of this one with Jack Nicholson cast as the Snow Mizer and Danny Devito as Heat Mizer)
