 While a  large part of addiction is an escape from feeling and  living in  the pain and suffering of the present moment, this book offers a profoundly inspirational, yet simple perspective to guide recovery from alcoholism and other forms of addiction.   William Alexander uses  mindfulness teachings and meditation to ultimately help achieve transcendence from  the addiction.  In the present moment,  Alexander explains, is where we achieve our healing and wholeness.
