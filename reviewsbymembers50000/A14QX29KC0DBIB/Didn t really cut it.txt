 This is the only LaVyrle Spencer book that I was ever unable to finish!  I tried several times to become engaged in the story (a nun falling in love with a father, etc., seems like it would be engaging enough!!), but always found myself putting the book down and forgetting about it.  I think a Spencer fan should attempt this book, as others seem to like it, but should probably already enjoy the author before they try it.  The only reason I did not give it 1 Star is because I respect the author and her attempt too much for that.
