 "Choice Language" picks up where "Nadurra" left off in terms of developing a more jazzy, modern sound on which to overlay their traditional music.  The instrumentals contain a more coffeehouse jazz feel (think of some of Solas's work) which highlights the piano lines, a nice addition.  Donald Shaw continues to write timely music with "Who Will Raise their Voice?", a beautiful anti-war song along the lines of "God's Alibi" (from "To the Moon").  For the traditionalists, there are some wonderful puirt-a-beul songs featuring Karen's spectacular voice.  Is this album like any before?  No.  Will it please everyone?  Probably not.  But is it a different sound from a well-established and respected band that, ultimately, increased my respect for their talents as musicians, not to mention voices of traditional Scottish music?  Most certainly!
