 okay, bad news first: it's long.  very long.  at parts i was thinking, "okay, why do i need to know this?  why does it matter what time their Divination O.W.L. is?"  but if you make it through that (and other dragging paragraphs), the book is another great chapter of the harry saga.  i seldom have the pleasure of reading books that envoke such an emotional response from me.  i LOATHE umbridge, and am not too terribly fond of the ministry in general.  i'm conflicted about snape.  i laughed out loud while harry was confused about cho chang and her emotions, and hermione's "no frills" scientific approach to the feelings of adolescent females.  i found myself cross with harry and his fifteen-year-old angst and attitude.  i cried all the while reading about the death of one of the ...characters (don't worry ~ i won't give it away!).    it's a fabulous tale for every harry fan.  (tip: refresh yourself with books 3 and 4, as those plots and characters figure prominently in book 5; i spent some time referencing myself back to 3 and 4 to full understand 5.)
