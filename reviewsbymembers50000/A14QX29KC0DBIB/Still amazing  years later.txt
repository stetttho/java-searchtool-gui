 This is my all-time favorite book; I re-read it every year.  Besides being responsible for me changing my major at university and falling absolutely in love with medieval history, this book is thoroughly entertaining to those who may not have a history passion or even passing knowledge of the time period.  Penman is detailed enough to help along readers with little to no knowledge of medieval British history, but enthusiasts will delight in her detail and character development.  If you have even a remote interest in history, Richard III, or murder, intrigue and deceit, read this book!!
