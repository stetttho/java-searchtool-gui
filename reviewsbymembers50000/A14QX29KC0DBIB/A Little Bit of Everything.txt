 This album was my favourite Capercaillie offering for quite awhile; it has a little bit of everything.  Many of the songs are of a slow, haunting persuasion, but there's also a country-esque track ("Crooked Mountain"), and a couple rockier numbers.  The highlight of the CD is definitely "Ailean Duinn"; this is the beautiful studio version of the song Karen Matheson sang around the bonfire in "Rob Roy".  Another part of that movie made its way onton "To The Moon": the "Rob Roy Reels", which feature Michael McGoldrick, whose continuing collaboration with Capercaillie has only made a great band even better.
