 In my opinion, this is the weakest of Kleypas's novels; it was the second novel by her that I read and made me rethink my initial attraction to the author.  I found the characters to be non-engaging and the story predictable and dragging.  I would recommend this novel only to a die-hard Kleypas fan.
