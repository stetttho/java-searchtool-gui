 i loved this book ~ it was hot, interesting, and focused on their monogamous relationship.  while the sex was a *little* kinky, carrington chose to avoid the traps of fetishes and very graphically kinky sex that sometimes can overwhelm the story.  the characters were real and believable; my only regret is that it didn't focus more on the relationship behind the relationship and ended abruptly.
