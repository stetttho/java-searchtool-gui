 This is one of my favorite Kleypas novels simply because the romance seems pure and true; Holly and Zachary are characters that readers can relate to and want to see succeed, in this case, in falling in love.  Zachary is the type of hero that I love to love; deep and brooding and ultimately vulnerable to love.  I would recommend this novel to anyone who loves romance and is looking to be introduced to Lisa Kleypas!
