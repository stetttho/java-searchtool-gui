 This book is brilliant!  I picked it up for a Film & Lit Adaptation course; the movie has always been one of my favourites, so I was interested in seeing where the film came from.  While quite different in format from the movie, the book not only maintains but is superior in terms of witty dialogue, humour, and pure zaniness.  I have passed this book along to other fans of the movie and they all agree; if you can get past the tediously long introduction, you're in for a treat!
