 Well, this is certainly a different sound side of Karen Matheson that we haven't seen before.  While I agree that the lack of Gaelic music is disappointing, the rest of the album cannot be lamented.  Each track (with the possible exception of "Phoebe") is remarkable in its own way and thoroughly enjoyable.  The title track, "Time to Fall", is addicting; the strong synthesized sounds along side her voice are fantastic.  Its nice to see a modern attempt meet with such success.
