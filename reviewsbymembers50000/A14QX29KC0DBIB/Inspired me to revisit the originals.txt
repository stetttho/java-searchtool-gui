 When I received this album for Christmas and popped it into the CD player, I, like many other Beatles enthusiasts, prepared to be disappointed ~ and was pleasantly surprised.  First of all, how wonderful to hear the Stereophonics on the CD!  (Those of you who don't know the Stereophonics, pick up "Just Enough Education to Perform" ... it's a fabulous romp through Welsh rock.)  I found their cover brilliant, Mark Penn and Aimee Mann's cover of "Two of Us" enchanting, and The Vines' "I'm Only Sleeping" a wonderfully contemporary version of one of my favorites.  With the exception of "Julia" (okay, I'm sorry, but I just found him oddly scary), the covers ranged from "amusing" to "toe-tapping" to "makes me stop what I'm doing and listen".  It inspired me to break out my Beatles albums and listen to them again, something I haven't done for awhile.  Another plus: two of my friends who are self proclaimed "Beatles Haters" (why am I friends with these people?!) listened to the albums and announced they loved the songs; they loved the range the different artists brought to the soundtrack.  So there's that.  Which is nice.
