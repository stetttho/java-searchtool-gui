 I came across Terry Deary completely by accident ~ in a gift shop in Scotland, shoved amongst other more "scholarly" hardcovers.  As my graduate area of study is the Middle Ages, I was intrigued and bought the book on a whim ~ and haven't stopped buying Terry Deary's books since!  Are the books chock-full of historical facts guaranteed to allow someone to walk away thinking they know everything about the Middle Ages, Greece, Rome, France, or any of Deary's other topics?  No, of course not.  Are the books a wonderfully entertaining (and illustrated!) way of addressing what can admittedly be a bit of a dry topic?  Of course!  I say any books that can make someone, young or old, become interested in history should be embraced fully.  And, hey, I learn something new from every book I read, which is an added bonus!  Further, I think these books definitely appeal to adults who have an interest or education in history ~ much as what "The Reduced Shakespeare Company" teaches us about Shakepeare is true about Deary's treatment of history: the better you know the original, the more funny and entertaining the condensed versions are.
