 i was assigned this novel for a course and thought it would be another dry novel such as the ones typically assigned for university history courses.  i was pleasantly surprised!  salzman's sense of humor and good natured relating of the events surrounding his two years in china is only surpassed by his knowledge and understanding of the culture he lived in for those years.  it is an excellent story for anyone who is learning about china or simply wants to know more about the culture.  salzman's view as an american looking in is especially helpful for western readers.
