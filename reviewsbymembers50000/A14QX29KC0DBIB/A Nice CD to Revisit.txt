 This is one of the first Capercaillie CDs I bought and instantly fell in love with it.  It's a wonderful CD to start out with, for it highlights many of the things that makes Capercaillie an amazing band: Karen Matheson's amazing voice and pure talent, the entertaining arrangements of jigs (and, again, talent of the band), and the band's writing ability, too.  In comparison to the other CDs, in my opinion it's not the best, but it's still fabulous!!!
