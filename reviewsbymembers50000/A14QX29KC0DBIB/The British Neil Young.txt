 I originally bought this CD because I was terribly fond of "Trouble" and my Scottish friend informed me that he viewed Chris Martin as the "British Neil Young."  While I'm still not sure if I believe that, I can see some similarities.  Coldplay's music is incredibly honest, soulful, and very entrancing.  This is not a genre that I generally enjoy, but this CD immediately captivated me and remains one of my favourites; you'll always find it in my CD player!
