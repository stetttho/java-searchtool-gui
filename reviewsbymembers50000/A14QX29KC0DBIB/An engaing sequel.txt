 The sequel to "Lady Sophia's Lover", "Worth Any Price" brings back Nick Gentry, which is certainly a wonderful premise for any novel!  Gentry's character is roguish yet sweetly entertaining and Charlotte is a wonderful foil for him, a somewhat reserved girl who comes into her own while standing up for herself and the love she finds with her husband.  I would definately recommend the book for any Kleypas fan, but not as a novel of introduction to the author.
