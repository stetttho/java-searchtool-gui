 This CD is absolutely brilliant ~ I've been listening to it repeatedly for the last 48 hours!  It contains a few more "serious", beautiful songs than "Shuffleboard", but for the fans of the tongue-in-cheek Deirdre, there are plenty of wonderful cuts on "Then Again" that will keep you laughing, cheering, and, yes, screaming the praises of fondue along with her.
