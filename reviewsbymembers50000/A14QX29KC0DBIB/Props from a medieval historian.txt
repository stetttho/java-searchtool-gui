 world war II history ~ actually, any history post-1745 ~ is traditionally of no interest to me.  that is, until i stumbled across the last half of the episode "bastogne" on BBC while living in scotland.  i became instantly engrossed in the episode, even though i knew nothing of the characters, plot, or, even, the name of what i was watching.  subsequent research determined that i had missed the beginning part of the mini-serieis and would, in fact, miss the final episodes before i figured out what was going on.  imagine my thrilled surprise to see the series aired recently on the history channel!  i was addicted instantly ~ my life revolved around watching the episodes, telling everyone i knew about them and, frankly, annoying the heck out of my friends by recapping each morning in the office, generally accompanied by tears or anger ~ "they killed blithe!" or "and then toye got hit, and guernere went to get him ... oh, lord, don't get me started on buck compton!"  and so on .... finally some wonderful friends bought me this DVD version so i can watch it whenever i want!  (true friends!!) i recommend this mini-series to anyone who is interested in history, heroism, or simply stories of friendship and survival.  it is brilliantly acted and the changing narration allows the viewer to witness the war through the eyes of officers, privates and medics, and to focus on the company and their relationships as whole, not to mention the soldiers as individuals.  the documentary is an excellent way to delve deeper into the series as well as to observe how the war truly affected the men who served, not to mention their children and grandchildren. and props to brit actor damian lewis (lieutenant/captain/major richard lewis) for his american accent ~ took me a few minutes to recognize soames!
