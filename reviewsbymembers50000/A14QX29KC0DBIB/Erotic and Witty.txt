 I found this story to be thoroughly enjoyable.  Not only did I get a kick out of the Shakespearean references (English major that I was), but Rosalind is entertaining with her refusal to fit any romantic norms.  And Griff, too, as the pursurer wanting to settle down was nice to see for once; it was lovely to see the female force wreak such havoc upon the male protagonist.  Perhaps the "misleading identity" crisis was a bit overdrawn, but original.  And Rosalind's unorthodox behaviour definitely led to more than a few entertaining and inticing scenes!
