 this book was enjoyable, a quick, basic read.  i found some of the dialogue between jack and natalie to be bland and often found myself wishing gaeddert would have explored a conversation or incident further.  and if you're looking for the physical aspect of a romance, this one does not have it.  but if you're looking for a nice, refreshing account of how two people fall in love in an unorthodox fashion, this is a great experience.
