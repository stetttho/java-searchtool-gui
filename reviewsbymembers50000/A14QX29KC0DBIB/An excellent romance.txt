 I LOVE THIS BOOK!  That really seems to be all there is to say ... it's simply fabulous.  Lorna and Jens are a wonderful couple and their innocence and naivete are refreshing in lieu of other jaded romance pairings.  The love is honest, the romance is true, and I always end this book on a sigh; it's that good!  This novel is a must for anyone who loves romance, particularly of the sweet and endearing type!
