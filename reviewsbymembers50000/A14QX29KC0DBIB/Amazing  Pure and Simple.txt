 This is by far the most sophisticated, syncronized CD of Capercaillie's to date.  It has a little of everything from the past CDs; a lot of Gaelic music (including one of the most beautiful songs ever, "Number Four", since I can never remember the Gaelic!), a few English songs, and perhaps the best jigs and reels they have produced thus far.  The band has also adopted a newer, more modern, marketable feel that may alienate some, but if you get past that, you'll see pure brilliance.
