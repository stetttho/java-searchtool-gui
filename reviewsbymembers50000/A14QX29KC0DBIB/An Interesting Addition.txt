 Warning: THIS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER CAPERCAILLIE CD!!!  This is, interestingly enough, the first one I bought, and it's wonderful; it managed to get me hooked on the band.  But as a compilation of soundtracks, many of the tracks are short, transitional music; many are instrumental.  The vocalised songs are nice, but showcase merely Karen's beautiful voice, not necessarily her magnificent talent.  It's a wonderful addition to a complete Capercaillie collection, but not necessarily representative of the band's other offerings.
