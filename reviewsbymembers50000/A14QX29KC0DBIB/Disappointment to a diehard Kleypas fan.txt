 I did not like this book at all, and I certainly tried to!  An avid Kleypas fan, I was eagerly anticipating this novel, but found it hard to wade through, follow, and got completely confused during the flashback section.  While Emma and Nikki are entertaining as the central characters, their relationship and dialogue was not enough to make this a positive experience for me.  This novel certainly follows a different formula from Kleypas's other books and I would only recommend it to her devoted fans.
