 Yes, the romance is steamy between Emily and Tom.  Yes, there is the angst-filled torment for the lovers which can be headily enjoyable.  Sure there are complications in the forms of fiancees, family obligations, and lack of support from friends and family, but I found that the story was rather predictable and the characters not terribly strong.  I would recommend this book to die-hard Spencer fans and certainly not as an introduction to the author.
