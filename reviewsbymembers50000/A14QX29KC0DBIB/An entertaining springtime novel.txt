 A very entertaining novel, although parts of it were difficult for me to fathom, particularly the reason why Winn continues to stay with Paul, even after beginning her romance with Joseph.  However, this scenario makes for a wonderfully angst-filled romance, for those readers who enjoy tortured lovers!  Joseph is endearing and a classical "good man" and is therefore easy to fall in love with.  Winn is slightly more difficult to support, in my mind, but still inspires sympathy.  Recommended for Spencer fans!
