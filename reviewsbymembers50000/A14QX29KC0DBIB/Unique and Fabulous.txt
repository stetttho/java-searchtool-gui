 Yes, it sounds like a concept that wouldn't work: traditional Celtic music and African chants.  It is FABULOUS ~ it's a lively, driving CD that is wonderful from start to finish; it is by far my favourite Capercaillie, perhaps because of its uniqueness.  This album is unlike anything you've ever heard, even put out by the band.  There's plenty of mouth music to show off Karen's talent, and lots of fiddle work for fans of Charlie (like me!).  It's brilliant and a must have for any Capercaillie fan!  (My mom plays it when she cleans her house 'cause she says it motivational.)
