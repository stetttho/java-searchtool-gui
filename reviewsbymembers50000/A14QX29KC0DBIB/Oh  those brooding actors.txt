 It was lovely to see Lucas Scott in his own romance!  Brooding, artistic, emotionally withdrawn and stubborn as heck, Lucas is a wonderful hero and Madeline provides a perfect heroine foil for him.  While rather sweet and naive, occasionally a bit too much so, their relationship develops into something pure, although, of course, it takes them several hundred pages to figure that out.  Lucas's adversion to commitment (and his relationship with his family and neighbors) seems a bit too much at times, but can be dismissed as a by-product of his artistic temperament.  A must for Kleypas fans!
