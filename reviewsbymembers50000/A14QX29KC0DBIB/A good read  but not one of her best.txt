 I absolutely adore Lisa Kleypas and rushed out to buy this book the moment it was released.  While an interesting and entertaining read, I would not place it as one of Kleypas's best efforts.  (Which still makes it better than many other authors.)  The plot is engaging enough (estate working boy loves rich employer's daughter, which, as we all know, brings drama), but I often feel there wasn't enough reason NOT to be together.  Several times during the novel I just wanted to say, "Get OVER it" and put the book down.  On the flip side, it was nice to have the subplot of Aline's sister and McKenna's partner; it livened up the book a bit.
