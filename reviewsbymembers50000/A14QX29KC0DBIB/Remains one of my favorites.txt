 I love this book, one of my favorite Spencer novels!!  She takes the concept of the "mail order bride" and crafts a beautiful, engaging love story around it.  Karl and Anna are wonderful characters that readers will be able to relate to; Karl is strong, traditional, and of the quiet persuasion while Anna, typically, is his opposite, possessing an out-spoken, fiery personality.  However, the central part of the story and the issues in their lives are often surprising and keep the story flowing, as do their reactions to it.  "The Endearment" is a wonderful novel about how love can grow in unlikely places and that the heart can survive, build upon, and ultimately become stronger through many trials.
