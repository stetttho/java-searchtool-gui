 Certainly the best part of this Kleypas novel is the anticipation of wanting to know if Hunter is actually Hunter or not; with this premise as the central part of the story, the novel holds the reader's interest.  The character of Larissa (Lara) is not one of Kleypas's better written women, but Hunter is riveting.  The subplot of Lara's sister and her abusive relationship is rather harsh and, to be honest, realistic for a romance novel; it will definitely either make or break the novel's enjoyment for readers.
