 This book was every bit as good as the Pirate Lord, which I thought would be difficult.  Although I initially found the reason Emily decided to become Emma a bit difficult to believe, I forgave Jeffries completely as I became enthralled with the story of Jordan and Emily/Emma.  And after the scene in the British Museum, I will never view the Elgin Marbles in the same manner!!
