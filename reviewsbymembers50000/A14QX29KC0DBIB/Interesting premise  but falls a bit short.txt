 The concept of a husband long suspected lost at sea returning to find his wife married to his best friend is certainly an interesting concept, but ultimately, I feel, this story falls short of its potential.  I did not feel sympathy for Laura and felt that her character was weak and did not inspire empathy or compassion.  Rye, while I felt sorry and empathized with his situation, was rather annoyed by his lack of respect for the Laura-Dan situation.  In the end, I liked Dan best of all and felt that he conducted himself the best given the situation, and actively felt sorry for the man.  Not really how you want to end a novel, feeling sorry for a man other than the hero!
