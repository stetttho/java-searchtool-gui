 I fell in love with this movie (and Fred Savage) as a child, and it has continued to entertain me!  A grown-up fairy tale, it's a wonderful mix of pirates, princesses, intrigues, spies, dastardly villians and gorgeous heroes....it's got everything!  The humour is something that you can only appreciate with age, so it works on many levels for all generations.  It's a great film to relax with on a rainy day, or share with a friend.  Definitely recommended!!!
