 If Capercaillie has done anything consistently and successfully, it has been to change the sound of their performances.  "Secret People" took a long while to grow on me, for it definitely has a hard, more rock influenced sound than any other CD.  Yet it still maintains and exhibits the band's strength: mouth music featuring Karen Matheson, reels and jigs that fulfill the necessary "traditional" sound we appreciate, and softer, more melodic songs.  This CD also has a very political aspect to it, exhibited best in "Black Fields" and "Four Stone Walls" (reminiscent of "Crooked Mountain" in terms of sound).  But the driving beat behind this album is addicting (particularly "Bonaparte") and will only enhance a Scottish collection.
