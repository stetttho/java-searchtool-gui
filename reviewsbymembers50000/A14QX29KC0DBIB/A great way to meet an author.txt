 This was the first novel of Kleypas's that I read and I was instnatly hooked.  The novel begins with a unique premise: a woman on the verge of her "spinster birthday" ordering a male "companion" for the evening.  While Jack's character is fairly typical to romance novels (tall, dark and brooding), he retains a measure of vulnerability that is a wonderful addition.  Amanda is a brilliant foil to Jack's character and the two of them have an entertaining courtship.  Highly recommended!
