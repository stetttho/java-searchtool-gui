 A very entertaining read, although not personally one of my Spencer favorites.  The characters of Allison and Lee will appeal to strong, independent women who have been burned by love, and yet remain optimistic about romance.  While the male lead characters, in my opinion, could have been examined more in depth, the end result is a pleasant enough romance.
