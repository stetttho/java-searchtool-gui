 This is one of the best romantic novels I have read and certainly one of Kleypas's strongest.  The story is pretty typical: a sweet, innocent country girl lost in the big city with no experience or understanding of where she is who meets a jaded, mysterious man who dances around the fringe of acceptable society.  However, that aside, Kleypas manages to weave a completely unique and lovely story around the central characters that is touching and engaging.  The story contains the right amount of romantic angst, is very steamy and yet remains real.  Highly recommended!
