 Maybe I was too generous in giving 4 stars - should have been 3 or 3 and a half...  The phone is very attractive and light weight.  But the battery drains so quickly - Despite of their claim of 540 minutes of talk time and 300 hours of stand-by time, After using for a day, the battery meter becomes yellow short bar - warning sign that the battery is almost completely drained (talk about 2 hours and stand-by for 22 hours).    Also, the voice volume is not as loud - I live and work in Manhattan as a sales rep, meaning most of the calls I receive and make are done so outside.  Even with the loudes setting, I sometimes can't hear caller's voice. Also, several people made comments that the background noise level that they hear are excruciatingly loud - I never had this problem with my former Nokia or Motorola phones.    I am also not so thrilled about Cingular - their customer service closes so early during the weekdays (I believe it's around 9pm) and they are closed on Sundays.  All other carriers that I had (Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile) had customer service 24/7.    Also, the phone keeps asking if I want to update the time, like every hour!  I called Cingular but there was nothing they could do.  They said that it was because of the phone, not its service.  I have a friend who has Motorola V400, and he swears it is the best phone.  I also have talked to several people @ Cingular, and they personaly use V400 or V600.  So you may want to opt for these phones instead of T637.
