 I love this headset!  Not only it is light and comfortable to wear, but it's also stylish.  The volume level is fantatic and the sound is very clear.  I had tried Jabra BT250 and it was so staticky that I had to return it.  I live and work in NYC, and you can hear the voice clearly even with noisy background.  I highly recommend this product - BTW, my phone is Sony Ericsson T637.
