 My mentor/life coach recommended this book, and I could not put this book down once I started reading.  Dr. Baer explains in plain language, with no b.s., what we are doing wrong and what has to be done to give and receive REAL LOVE so we could be truly happy.  With the work I have been doing with my life coach (you can find her on amazon.com - catherine diane - and learn more about her if you are interested in having an amazing, VERY EFFECTIVE, very loving life coach yourself), I am truly getting the benefits out of this book.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
