 I read the review by An Electronics Fan from Paonia, CO, and started laughing so hard!  It's sooo true that mute button on this phone is in the wrong place.  I kept pressing it with my cheek!!!  The key pads do not light up, and you don't hear the tone you usually hear when you press the numbers. It doesn't cradle well so it's not comfortable for someone who stays on the phone for long.   However, the receoption is much better than my old Sony cordless that was 900 Mhz.  The sound is clear and I do like the style of this phone.  It is cheap, and that is probably the best feature of this phone.  :-)
