 I used this item with Sony Ericsson T637.  While it was comfortable to wear, I could not hear the caller's voice due to the static, and I am holding the phone in my hand so I know it's not the distance that was a problem.  I tried several calls at different locations, but the performance remained very poor.  I really can't recommend this product - I now bought Motrola HS810, and it works PERFECTLY.
