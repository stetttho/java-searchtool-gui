 I have been practicing yoga for a year and a half now, and tried some videos and cd's.  When I take my yoga classes, it's usually 75-90 minutes, and I wished this video was at least 75 minutes long.  The Sun Salutation segment was way too short, and there weren't enough sitting posistions for stretch.  But the flow was just beautiful, and you will definately get the work-out from this tape.  Over-all, I do recommend this tape.  However, if you are not used to practicing yoga by just listening to the instructor, you may want to see the tape first before practicing.  The pace is pretty fast.  :-)
