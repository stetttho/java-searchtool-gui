 It took me a while to decide which canister vacuum to get, amongst Bissel 6700, Eureka 3672B, Eureka 965A, and Panasonic MC-V3900.  I'm very happy I got this one!  I live in a small one-room apartment in NYC with a cat.  This vacuum picks up everything!!!  Also, it's very easy to store with the hose holder - you don't have to diassemble and it keeps the hose upright position.    I just *LOVE* this little machine!
