 First thing first.  Thanks to Ginny' Man's review, I bought this phone through Wirefly.  After rebate, it was FREE, and I received a free Bluetooth headset.     I had Sony Ericsson T637 with Cingular for the past year.  When I switched to RAZR/T-Mobile, I was hoping that people could hear me better.  Everyone complained that the background noise through T637 was unbearable.  (I live in NYC and I make and receive calls on the streets 85% of the time.)  So far, they say they could not tell the difference between T637 and RAZR.  HOWEVER, the incoming volume is definitely MUCH LOWER with RAZR than T637.  My Gosh, I have the volume to the MAX but I CANNNOT hear the words of people on the other end!!!!  I am not into all the gadgets, and to me the most important feature of a cell phone is to make and receive calls clearly.    I had owned many different phones but in terms of volume, Nokia had it best.  Local T-Mobile customer rep said that Nokia has entirely different speaker system, and yes, they are the best in the industry.  If you do not live in the City, I would assume the volume level might be good.  But if you live in the City, I would avoid this phone.
