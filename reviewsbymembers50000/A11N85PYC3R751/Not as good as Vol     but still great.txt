 I assume everyone interested in this CD is a Serious Zappaphile. It's great, you should buy it... but know that Volume 2 of this series, the Helsinki Concert, is the best. 'Tiny Sick Tears' really stood out for me  on the first listening - it's got a sort of Jim Morrison reference that had  me rolling on the floor laughing. Nice version of 'Willie the Pimp',  too. The great thing about this series is that it's the Ultimate Guide to  Conceptual Continuity. We can hear how the different bands played the  various songs, and how Frank's musical conception changed over time. There  is a theory that says that Frank only wrote one song, but it's REALLY LONG.  This collection gives me an idea of how that could be.
