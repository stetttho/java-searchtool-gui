 Wellman was one of the great American fantasists, and this series is pretty much the definitive Wellman collection. John Pelan has done a great job selecting the stories, and the book itself is of high quality. It will look good on your shelf, it will last through many readings - and you really aren't going to be able to find the original stories in paperbacks and pulps. You just want to read, and the price is quite reasonable when you think about how much time and money you'd spend on the first editions. Even reprints of this stuff are hard to track down. It's kind of like the horror equivalent of the NESFA Press collections, like the three-volume Hal Clement omnibus - great stories that aren't easy to find, collected and presented. Kudos to Pelan and Nightshade for giving us a great edition of hard-to-find, high quality horror. Let's hope they keep it up with other authors, I'll keep buying them.
