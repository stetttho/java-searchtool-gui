 This DVD contains 4 episodes of Yu Yu Hakusho, uncut, in subs and dubs. If you are buying this, you probably have already seen a fair bit of YYH, and know that it has a clean visual style, and a focus on fighting and magic, with themes of honor and loyalty and perserverance. This DVD is no exception. The episodes on this DVD cover the first round of the Dark Tournament, which Yusuke and his friends are forced to compete in. The stakes are absurdly high, as is the level of power needed for our heroes to win - so much so that you'll wonder what the show will do to top itself in the next however-many rounds of the tournament.  The pace is unhurried, but nothing like Dragonball Z's lazy meandering through fights. Rarely does a single fight exceed one episode, and often we get through two of them in a single half-hour. This DVD has more screen time for Kuwabara's older sister, who smokes, drinks, and can take care of herself. More hints about the Mystery Fighter are dropped, also. This DVD came with a sticker saying "Ages 13 and up", and that's as much for the language and a single obscene gesture as it is for the demon-decapitating violence.
