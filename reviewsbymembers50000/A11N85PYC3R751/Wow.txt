 I first saw the Persuasions at a 'Zappa's Universe' tribute concert, where they performed 'The Meek Shall Inherit Nothing'. It brought the house down. That same quality is evident here. I would however say that the first half  of the album is better, and on vinyl I would probably not play side two  much.
