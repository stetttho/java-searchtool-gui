 The usual John Barnes goodness, set in what appears to be the same universe as Kaleidoscope Century (among others). Like those others, the talent and originality that caused some to hail him as the New Heinlein are marred by graphic depictions of extreme violence.  Overall, a very thought-provoking and ultimately uplifting novel - but I'll never lend it to my mother; the sick parts would make her cry.
