 I haven't tried all of these recipes yet, but so far it's been great. The only downside would be that some of the ingredients are quite unfamiliar to me (chayote, for example), and I have no idea where to get a half gallon of  coconut milk around here. It is worth noting that this book has many nice  fish and seafood recipes, not just a bunch of barbecued meats.  Tomorrow,  cornmeal porridge for breakfast. Finally I will know what Bob Marley was  singing about in No Woman No Cry.
