 I have never seen the movie, and only bought this album (on vinyl) because at the time I bought one of everything that had "Jello Biafra" in the credits. There are some fantastic tracks on it (NoMeansNo, the  Groovaholics, Evan Johns), and none that really suck. If any more are ever  pressed, it's worth your hard-earned entertainment dollars. Maybe someday  I'll get to see the film it goes with.
