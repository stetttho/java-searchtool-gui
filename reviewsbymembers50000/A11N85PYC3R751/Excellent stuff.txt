 The full title of this DVD is "The Evil Dr Ichigaki", and it contains 4 episodes of Yu Yu Hakusho. This DVD covers the second round of the Dark Tournament. Yusuke and his friends are forced to compete against Team Ichigaki, who are basically human, rather than demonic like most of the competitors. I hesitate to say more, because I don't want to give anything away. Suffice it to say that we learn more about the Masked Fighter, good triumphs enough to make it to Round Three, and evil is punished. As the Dark Tournament progresses, Yusuke's team is suffering an increasing number of injuries, and is getting worn down. There are at least six more episodes of Dark Tournament after this DVD, so there should be some challenging fights ahead. In this way, this DVD is exactly like every other YYH release.
