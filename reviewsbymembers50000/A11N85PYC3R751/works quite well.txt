 These are wonderful arrangements, and the music on this CD is quite accessible - even my 5 year old daughter likes it. While you have to be a pretty devoted fan of experimental music to get into many of the tracks on  'The Yellow Shark', this one is a great way to introduce Serious Music  People to the Frank Zappa we know and love. Reccomended for all Zappa  fans and chamber music types.
