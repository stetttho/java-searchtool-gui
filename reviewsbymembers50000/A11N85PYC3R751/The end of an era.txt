 "LADIES and GENTLEMEN! Would you please welcome, for the VERY LAST TIME, EVER, the World's Fattest Junkies, POISON IDEA!"  Thus opens one awesome, final show from the best punk band ever. The set contains some straight-up hardcore ("Death, Agony and Screams", "Give it Up") and some of their more accessible rockin' tunes ("Plastic Bomb", "Crippled Angel", "Hangover Heart Attack").  Poison Idea was always tighter than they looked, and this is obvious on this album. The sound is great, the mix is outstanding, although maybe a little more crowd response sound would have made it perfect. Some noteworthy things that happen on this record: Sam Henry is playing an electric organ on some songs, which works VERY well indeed. In the last song, their cover of "Up Front", someone throws something up on stage, and gets a much-deserved earful from Jerry A for it. You'll dig this if you have even a single particle of hardcore in you. You will rock the hell out.
