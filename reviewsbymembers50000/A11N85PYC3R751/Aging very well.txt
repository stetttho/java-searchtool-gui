 I bought this album on vinyl when it was released. I sat in my room with headphones on, listening over and over again. It was great. I taped it and listened in my car. My friends asked, "what the hell IS this?". I  kept listening. It ruled. Time passed, I lost the tape, sold my  turntable. Last month I bought the CD, wondering if it would still sound as  good as it did when I was younger.  It mostly did. The highlights are  definately Moon Over Marin, California Ueber Alles (and if you like it too,  check out Spearhead, Mike Franti's current group), and the NOMEANSNO track  (a capella! wow!). The other tracks often benefit from a little more  volume, and some are too close to the original DK interpretation to be very  fresh, but altogether a fine tribute album, and worth your time and money  if you like Dead Kennedy's music.
