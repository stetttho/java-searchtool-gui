 This album is incredible. Find a musician, doesn't matter what instrument, and play this for them. Watch jaws drop.  Under unpleasent conditions, late in the '74 tour, in far nothern Europe, the Mothers played impossibly  difficult music at ludicrous speed, brightly, brightly, and with beauty.  This album is my favorite of all time, period. I got it on vinyl when it  came out, and I just about wore it out. If you put me on a desert island  with only one recording, this would be it. The sound isn't what it is on  the '88 recordings - there is no digital anything, and as others have  commented, the bass drum sounds less than perfect. There are hums and  clicks and buzzes from some of the gear - but that's not what I hear when I  listen to it. It's the power and precision and artistry of real musicians  really putting all they've got into it.  Beautiful. If you don't own a  copy you are missing all the fun.
