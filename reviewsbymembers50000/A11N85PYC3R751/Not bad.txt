 It's like the shadow of a Platonic Ideal of a fantasy-humor novel. Think Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser meet Pulp Fiction - only funnier. This book probably should have been written by Avram Davidson, who could have milked the silly names and goofy situations for a lot more literary goodness. As it stands, hey, I've paid more for worse.
