 While many of the reviews here mention the fine and useful contents of  this book, none seem to mention the incredible design of the book itself.  It is an unusual shape, with the text blocks positioned on the page with  rare elegance. It is well bound and sturdy. Before reading this book, I  had a vague idea that it was wrong to double-space after a period in a  proportional font. After reading, I have the backing of an authority on the  subject. My documents are prettier, and I have an appreciation for the  typographer's art that I simply hadn't before. There is a good deal of  content dealing with proper typography in non-English languages also, which  may prove useful to you. Well worth the money.
