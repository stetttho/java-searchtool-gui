 I am not qualified to say whether this is the best translation of the original words into modern words, but it certainly reads smoothly and feels right to me. Heaney takes us there, with very few breaks in the proper  structure, and equally few words that jar the modern ear.  This was an  ambitious project, and it certainly succeeded for me. I bought a bunch of  copies to give to friends in my medieval recreationist group. Most of us  already have another translation or two lying around, but this is the one  to read for the joy of it.
