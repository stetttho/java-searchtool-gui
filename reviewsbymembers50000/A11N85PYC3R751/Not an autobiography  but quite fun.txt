 We get some of everything with this one.  It gives us a feel for his personality and speaking style. Italics, underlining, and boldface are used liberally; I could hear his voice as I read. It gives us a nice  collection of anecdotes from various stages of Zappa's career, from his  high school years up through the orchestral work with the LSO - even a  couple of tales from the 1988 'Best Band You Never Heard'. If you like  these, you will wish there were more, though. It gives us what has to be  the best general description of a composer's work ever ('wiggling air  molecules, changing over time'). That chapter alone is worth the cost of  the book, if you are at all interested in music or art.  We also get the  political Zappa, some lyrics, the Zappa home life, and even a bit of What  Frank Eats (whatever the kids don't, apparently). The only thing we don't  get (and this is why I wish he'd lived another 30 years) is some detailed  analysis of his compositions. We get a couple of places where he is  discussing musical theory and practice from a technical perspective (chord  progressions that cannot occur in doowop, or why jazz drummers are not  normally appropriate in a Zappa band), there is no music printed in the  book to help the interested reader follow along. Certainly I can't fault  the book for this, but, man, it would have been nice if he'd written one  like that. If you are a student of music, a budding composer, artist, or  just think Frank freaks folks out, this is for you.
