 I have been a huge Punisher fan for years. Collected every comic and loved all the stories. Now, they were at times only just okay stories and sometimes boringly repetitive. I always hoped for an infusion of sorts to bring a great character back to the forefront.  With this new Punisher rendition, "Welcome Back, Frank", all I can say is YES!!!  It's a very dark, yet very funny portrayal of Frank Castle. No nonsense. Lots of killings of some really bad bad guys in sometimes very humorous ways. I laughed like crazy during the zoo killings. Exactly how I would have expected The Punisher to act towards the evil.  His confrontation with Daredevil was epic. Ole' hornhead never thought he'd find himself in that position. Talk about a mind screw to the max. Awesome.  I highly recommend this book for old fans and definitely the new ones. Don't know how many times I have read it, but I laugh every time. Welcome Back, Frank.
