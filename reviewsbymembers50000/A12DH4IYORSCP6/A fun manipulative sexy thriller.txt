 I never tire of this film... An excellent story with some very fun characters. To this day, my friends and I still debate as to who the real killer is. In Paul Verhoeven's commentary, he says very plainly who the killer, but it is still fun to play "what ifs". Michael Douglas is perfect as the dark, recovering drug and alcoholic, edgy cop, Nick Curran, who falls for the wrong person... or does he? They both sure seem to have a lot in common. Nick is continualy in trouble with internal affairs and has a very bad habit of while on the job, shooting his weapon and killing people. He is nicknamed, with affection, by Catherine Tramell "Shooter". Sharon Stone's film career flew after the release of "Basic Instinct". What a great role for her. A sexy, manipulative, dominant, intelligent, and seductive woman. Director Paul Verhoeven calls her a devil. She might be. Her eyes are amazing. You never quite know what exactly she is thinking. The DVD has some great special features. Two commentaries, test reels, storyboards, deleted scenes, but the fake "ice pick" that comes with the DVD should be enough for any real fan to want to buy this film. Enjoy.
