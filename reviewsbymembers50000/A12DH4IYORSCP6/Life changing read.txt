 Great book... Great book... Great book... Thought provoking... Meaningful... Enlightening... Deep... Life changing... Conversations with God makes sense and is very logical. God is in you. The relationship you have with Him is personal and different from everyone elses. I repeat... "Different from everyone elses."  It is up to YOU, with God's guidance, to change your life and to live in a more positive, enlightened, stress free, calm, happy, guilt free, confident and spiritual existence. All the tools are right there in front of you. I feel many people will shun this book out of fear, but I truly believe that with an open mind and if you are honest with yourself, you will begin to see the light. Give this book a chance and then judge for yourself. The key phrase is... "judge yourself", not others. Everyone in this planet is different and have their own special relationship with God, whatever it may be. Hopefully, people will learn to respect others and their decisions. Enjoy.
