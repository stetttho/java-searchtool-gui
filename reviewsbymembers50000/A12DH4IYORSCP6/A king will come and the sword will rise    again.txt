 Man, this book was nothing short of amazing. You don't have to be a fan of Arthurian lore to enjoy what Marion Zimmer Bradley has given us. A book of fantasy, and realism combined with truth, love, honor, faith and hope.  The author has a way of making her readers get deeply involved with her characters. I cared for Morgaine and hated her all at the same time. I understood completely why she did what she did and was still mad about it. I admired and pitied Lancelet. He was a tremendous hero and athlete and very well respected. He was the simply the greatest and most honorable knight ever and yet... how sad that his one  true love, his soulmate, Gwenhwyfar, could never, ever, be his. To have her and betray the love he shared with his best friend and king, Arthur, hurt him more deeply than any sword could ever do.  Marion Zimmer Bradley really captured the essence of the struggle between the "new" religion, christianity, and the older , more sensible, spiritual ways of Avalon and the Goddess. The book "Conversations with God" kept coming to mind the more I read. Very similiar ideals."All the Gods are One God" is the final lesson of this story. No matter what different names are given for them, they are all one in the same. This is what Morgaine finally learns after all her years of struggle and this revelation gives her her... peace. Excellent story. Expressed through the eye's of the key women in during the era of King Arthur. It never falters. Makes you anxious for the next page and leaves you sad when you are finished.
