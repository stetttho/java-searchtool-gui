 It was hard to put down "A Painted House". I was anxiously awaiting what would happen next. I was deeply involved with all the characters and how they interacted with each other.  It's a credit to John Grisham's writing skill. He doesn't need the old familiar courtroom, lawyer's office, or prison to write a good story with a lot of depth of character and heart.  "A Painted House" takes place during the early 1950's, in the deep south. It's the busiest and most stressful time of the year where there are acres and acres of cotton needing to be picked.   As seen through the eyes of a 7 year old, and his perspective on daily farm life, family, first love, baseball, Sunday church, and murder.  It's a great fun. Enjoy.
