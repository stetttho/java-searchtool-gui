 A single mom bears her heart and soul in this amazingly deep, spiritual poetry book. All poems were written by her from the young age of ten until present day. A very interesting perspective on love and life coming from one who began writing as a young child on through adulthood and eventually becoming a mother. All original drawings in "Inspired By You" were all drawn by the authors young child, Shylee. Clearly, a very talented child with a special gift. Her beautiful photos adds depth and insight to each upcoming chapter's topics. The final two chapters are very fun, spicy and clearly for grownups. A provocative take on relationships from a man's point of view as well as a womans. Enticing photos of our author, Lori, in various sexy poses, help give the final chapters its sizzle. For someone like myself who does not read poetry all that often, I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed "Inspired By You". I see the book more as lyrical poetry. Someone should see about putting music behind Lori's words. The childs drawings were excellent. The authors sexy poses were simply... SEXY!!! The book would make an excellent gift to friends and family. Lori's book, I've noticed, has a phone number and a website if you are interested in purchasing "Inspired By You".
