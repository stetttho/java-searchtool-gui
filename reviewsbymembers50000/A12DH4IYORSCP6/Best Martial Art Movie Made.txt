 The fight scenes are jaw dropping. The skill that is involved to perform those feats is mesmerizing. How far Jackie Chan will go to make as good a martial arts film as possible is highly commendable as well as very dangerous. I thoroughly enjoyed this picture. Seen it many times and still I wonder how those actors/stunt people performed some of those feats. It's pretty wild. The plot and story is also pretty funny, with Jackie Chan and his comedic timing. Sit back, relax and let the movie take you on a nice ride with lots of action.
