 What a surprising book The Last Alchemist was for me. I really did not know what to expect, but I do know once I started, I was completely intrigued with the life that Count Cagliostro lived. Was the Count a man of passion and love who gave his all to the weak and unfortunate, or was he simply a con artist who thrived on glory, fame, money and power??? Ultimately, it is for the reader to decide what kind of a man the Count really was. Maybe he had no choice and simply became what his destiny called for him to be. Whatever he was, the man was loved and loathed all at the same time. With each "miracle and healing" performed, his status grew and grew, among the locals, to dizzying heights. With each level of status attained, his enemies, full of jealousy, plotted and patiently awaited their chance for revenge. The Last Alchemist comes in a very easy to read format. The illustrations are quite good and gives insight to the person being talked about. Give it a chance and learn all about the man who was the "Robin Hood" and "Prince John" combined of two centuries past.  I recommend it.
