 With an open mind and willingness to see and accept beyond what is considered the standard way of life, "The Da Vinci Code" has opened new ground.  Am I saying "ALL" of what was written in the book is an absolute 100% fact??? No, but a lot of it does have the ringing of truth to it. You can't help but question all the discrepencies the author has put forth and want to know the truth. I guess it all really depends on how open the person is and how serious they are to find the real truth. But, make no mistake, the clues and discrepencies are all there which leads to the, oh, so many questions.  For example, the questions as to how the church really began and sustained for all those centuries is a major question. Maybe no one really wants those questions answered, but a lot of us do even if you don't like the answers. Once again, open your mind to the possibilities.  Also, the true origin of the bible leaves a lot of questions behind and only a confident, open minded person will see the truth behind what we, as a society, have been force fed since birth. Just look. Did God really, from heaven, fax us a copy of the one true bible??? No, I guess not, and the author does an excellent job explaining the manipulation and deceit of people in power who are trying to stay in power through religion.  Dan Brown has taken all these mysteries and questions and ran with it. "The Da Vinci Code" is a fantastic book. Very deep. Very enlightening. Very thrilling. Very moving.  Close minded people may say the book is horrid, evil, heretic... etc, but it isn't. THE BOOK IS AN EYE OPENER IF YOU AREN'T AFRAID TO SEE WHAT IS REALLY THERE.  I am reminded a lot of the fantastic book "The Mists of Avalon" and the battle between between christianity and the nature/pagan religion.  Take a moment and read "Da Vinci Code" and see if anything at all makes you question what you already believe to be true. If so, then Mr. Brown has done his job.
