 Stephen King's book, "IT", is to me about one word... friendship. Long lasting, undying, deep, gratifying, caring, heartfelt friendship. The kind of friendship that even if years pass without any real kind of contact, you can meet again and continue as if no time had passed at all.  The members of the "Losers Club met under strange and sometimes dire circumstances but, formed a bond that could never be broken. They shared deep and sometimes frightening secrets. They looked after one another and stayed strong "together" fighting a supernatural inhuman evil being in "Pennywise the Clown" who wanted them dead. "IT" had me very scared the three times I read the novel. How could it not? Werewolves chasing you while you race away on a bike. Horrid eerie voices coming from sewers and drains. Mummies and vampires and gigantic spiders. Maybe the worst is pictures in a photo album coming to life and trying to reach at you. Despite all it's horrors that can scare just about anyone, especially children, I found the kids growing attachment and need for one another, inspite of all their differences, most memorable. At times touching. Maybe the saddest truth of the novel is the "growing up" into adults and having lost your childhood innocence.  Stephen King definitely hit a homerun with this fictional horror, yet very real human story. I give it the highest recommendation.
