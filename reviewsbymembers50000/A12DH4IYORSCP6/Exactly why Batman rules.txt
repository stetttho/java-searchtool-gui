 Batman is the weakest of all the members of the Justice League, because he is simply a human being with no powers. Yet, he is the best and most dangerous superhero out of all of them. That is awesome!!!  Tower of Babel show exactly why Batman is not a man to be looked over, but feared. He compulsively fight crime to the nth degree no matter the cost or who he alienates. Probably the most amazing attribute about Batman is his amazing brain. Forever strategizing how to maintain the upper hand over his enemies... and his friends.  Batman keeps a cool distance over his friends because deep down he believes that one day there is a strong chance he will have to take them out. Does it make him a bad, untrustworthy person? That is the issue the members of the Justice League have to come to terms with.  Batman's ingenious ways to defeat all of the JLA have fallen into the hands of one of his worst enemies, Ras Al Ghul. Every JLA member is incapacitated, and Batman is to blame.  A great read with dire consequences in the end. The question ultimately is... is Batman wrong for doing it? It is for you to decide. Enjoy.
