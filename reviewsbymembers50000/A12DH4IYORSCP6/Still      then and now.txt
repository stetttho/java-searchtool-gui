 The simpliest way to describe "The Dark Knight Returns". THE BEST!!  What a story. What characters. What passion. What misery. What a thrill. We all got to see and experience, first hand, Bruce Wayne's troubled soul. The pain, misery and life questions he goes through on a daily basis as the years overlap. You could not help but understand and care and pity him all at the same time about his "on going war" with crime. He was a little boy who witnessed his parents being murdered. How would seeing that affect anyone of us? His ultimate nemesis, the Joker, coming out of his ten year catatonic state after simply hearing the name of Batman. The psychological bond between the two is eerie, almost as if one can't exist without the other. In truth they can't. When one man signifies the ultimate good and honor in men, there has to be it's complete opposite. The Joker is "the evil" in every sense of the word. I loved the tension between Superman's "good guy / sell out" persona compared to Batman's "selfish personal war" vendetta. As powerful as Superman is, he had NO CHANCE against the ever cunning Batman. Mind over muscle in the "Battle of the Titans". I find myself admiring and rooting for Bruce Wayne and the Batman because he is doing the best he can with the situation he is in. His "on going war" with crime is the only thing he can do that will exorcise his inner demons that forever trouble his soul.  Dark Knight Returns is an exquisite story as well as some very intelligent writing. Tremendous battles, amazing art and just extreme satisfaction. Enjoy it again and again as I have and will continue, first time readers and long time fans.
