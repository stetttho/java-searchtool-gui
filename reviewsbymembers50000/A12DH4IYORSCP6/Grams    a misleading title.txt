 The film was titled "21 Grams". It's explanation for that title is that when a person dies, after it's soul leaves, 21 Grams mysteriously is lost from your body. A very interesting concept, but it had nothing to do with the film. The mystery of 21 grams leaving your body is never explored.  What is left is a film filled with miserably sad people who are suffering from losses they have sustained and fighting personal demons. I think Sean Penn is a rare talent, but he is not nearly enough to carry this downer of a film.  "21 Yawns" is a better title.  It is said that after viewing this film, in it's entirety, that all the yawning that is done, when measured in breathe and water release, amounts to 21 Grams.  If THAT was the overall goal, then the film was a huge success.  Yawn...  Yawn...  Yawn...  Yawn...  Yawn...  Yawn...  Yawn...  Yep... 21 Grams.
