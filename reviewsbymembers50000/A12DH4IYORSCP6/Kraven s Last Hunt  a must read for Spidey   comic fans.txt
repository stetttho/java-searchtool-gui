 I have so much I want to say about "Kraven's Last Hunt". What an amazing book. Worthy of "The Dark Knight Returns". Spider-Man has always been a fun character. He jokes and plays around frequently while fighting and defeating his many villans. Kraven is different. Each loss was shocking and disturbing and heartfelt for him. As each loss accumulated, his mind reeled and fought taking him to the point of obsession and madness.  Kraven literally lost his mind. A proud man of honor and integrity who is continually humbled and humiliated by Spider-Man. He can't even accept the fact that Spider-Man is actually a man but some mystical unbeatable being who he calls "the spider". "No MAN could of done what you have done to Kraven", he says during one of his drug induced ritiuals.  We are taken into Kraven's disturbing world. Allowed to look into his disturbed soul and in a strange but sad way, you can sympathize with him. Even understand why he does all he does to include his very final desperate act.  Read the story from cover to cover and then read it a second time. Only, this time, read it through the mind of Kraven. Read only his captions. His thoughts alone is a remarkable story. Everyone I have suggested this to have all agreed. Kraven was never this intricate a character in previous Spider-Man stories. I absolutely love it and I will miss him. Kraven was more than just a super villan hellbent on destruction. He was a man of pride and honor who lived and died as such.
