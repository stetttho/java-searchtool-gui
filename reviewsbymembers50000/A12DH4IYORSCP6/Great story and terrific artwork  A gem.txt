 First off, let me say that I absolutely love the realness of the art work in this comic graphic novel. AMAZING!!!  What a gift it is to have a written story that rivals the artwork.  I thoroughly enjoyed Marvels. I love the concept of seeing the birth of superheros, in the Marvel Universe, through the eyes of a photo journalist. An everyday guy like you and me. From it's beginnings with the battles between the original Human Torch and the very angry Sub Mariner up until the very sad tragic death of Gwen Stacy at the hands of the Green Goblin.  Everything else in between those two story plots are just comic genius. An accurate timeline of Marvel events happening at once to every and all characters. While the Hulk was on a rampage in Washington, The Fantastic Four were having a wedding, and the Wasp was having her own clothing line... etc. It took an erratic history and put order back in.  Upon reading the series, I kept recalling all these stories I had read as a child. To see them all combined, backed by beautiful artwork was a sheer pleasure.  I highly recommend this graphic novel for old and new fans. Very smartly written. Very beautifully drawn.
