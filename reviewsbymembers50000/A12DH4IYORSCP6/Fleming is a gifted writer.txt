 I love the fact that Ian Fleming easily gets me involved with Bond's card game with Drax even though I know nothing about card playing. I understood exactly what was happening and thoroughly enjoyed Bond getting the better  of Drax. Flemings books are all superior to the films. I've read every Bond  book at least twice and look forward to a third time. Do yourself a favor a  give Bond and Fleming a chance.
