 The Godfather Legacy is a great collection of behind the scene stories, rumors, cast interviews, and unpublished film photos. Everything a real fans of the Godfather trilogys wants.  The books delves very deep with the first Godfather movie. From its initial spark of an idea about a "mafia" film, (The word "mafia" is not allowed to be said anywhere in the film.) to the long, arduous process of finding a director and cast, to the many problems on set, to finally, it's raving success  in the mainstream world and at the Academy Awards.   I am amazed how Francis Ford Coppola survived such an ordeal where he was continually threatened to be fired, and yet still turn out the epitome of gangster films. The casting of unfavorable actor Marlon Brando, as the aging Don Corleone, was an inspired choice. The casting of, yet unknown, Al Pacino, as the meek turned hardened crime boss Michael, was a fight from the very beginning, but proved to be the films star find.  Harlan Lebo's book speaks also of the 2nd and 3rd Godfather films, but not at length like he did the first film. That would be my only complaint. I wanted to really feel, and understand the difference between the first film, with the tremendous pressure Coppola felt directing, to the complete freedom he was given at doing the 2nd film, and his controversial choices in Godfather III. Hopefully, he'll come out with a more detailed book one day. Fingers crossed.
