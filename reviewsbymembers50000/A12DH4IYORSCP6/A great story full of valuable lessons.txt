 I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. (I've read it twice already)  This is a story of a man, Jason, trying to protect his soul mate, Sloan,  from being killed in her past lives by a psychopath. The details and lessons the author puts in the story during Jason's many past life regressions are deep and valuable.  With each of his five regressions, Jason begins to understand and embody what the true meaning of life is all about. He learns love and compassion are the ultimate answer.  A love of life, a love of self and a compassion toward everyone.   He begins to understand that people themselves create their own misery or personal hell. Your thoughts are what define you and your life.    Anyone who is open minded, looking for truth and has enjoyed reading books like, "Conversations With God", "Many Lives, Many Masters", "Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting" will love Self Inflicted.  Give Self Inflicted a chance. You'll have a good time, learn a lot and feel good about yourself.  Enjoy.
