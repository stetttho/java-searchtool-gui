 Books are usually better than movies. This one is a toss up. I love the film for it's visual aspects. I adore the book for it's details that the movie could never bring you.  I was freaked out on many occasions reading "Poltergeist". The part with "the beast" and how it thinks and hates really got to me. To think that they, the spirits, are standing there in front of you without you even knowing. The battle between "the beast" and Tangina is epic. It was an extremely well written book and thank goodness a damn good movie. Enjoy them both.
