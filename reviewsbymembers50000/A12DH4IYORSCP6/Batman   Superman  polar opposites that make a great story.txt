 Batman and Superman have always been amazing characters, yet couldn't be any more different in their approach for fighting against crime. Batman, the ever dark personality that uses his anger to overcome great odds. Superman, the boy scout who looks for the good in all and fight for truth, justice and the american way.  "Public Enemies" displays just how different these two are and does so beautifully by displaying each ones personal thoughts throughout the book.   Fighting for a common goal, they each show tremendous respect for the other, though not agreeing entirely on each others tactics. They almost, in a way, dislike the fact that they have to rely on one another at times. It is almost hard to say that them two are real friends and it is very easy to see how they could become mortal enemies if the circumstance permits. A very intriguing alliance.  In "Public Enemies", President Lex Luthor, has put a billion dollar bounty on their heads and every known bad guy has come to claim it. "Public Enemies" has a great collection of team battles with classic villians and epic confrontations with former team members.  A great read, with a lot of action, that comes highly recommended.
