 Leave it to H.G. Wells to come up with a book on time traveling into the future and leaving us, the readers, totally captivated. What a visionary. The movie, which I have seen many times, did a great job of keeping to the original storyline. If you have not seen it, please do so. Amazing film. What I love about the book is how much further Wells went with the story. Towards the end of the book, our weary time traveller proceeds further into the future to actually witness our earth and sun dying. The barren lands growing cold. Life at its final stages. How utterly eerie yet thrilling all at the same time. Wells describes the sequences so vividly. Who would not do the same if a time machine was made available to them?  For you first time readers, enjoy. It is a terrific ride.
