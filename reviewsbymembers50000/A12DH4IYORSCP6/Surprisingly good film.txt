 I didn't know what to expect when I first saw this film. I do know that at the film's conclusion, I found that I could not stop talking about how much I enjoyed it.  The acting was wonderful. Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser were amazing together. Lynn Redgrave, one word... wow. The way the director, Bill Condon, shot film was very artistic and inspiring. It was a very well written story about loneliness, friendship, longing, struggle and death. Listen to the soundtrack. It's terrific and totally helped to enhance the film for me.  It's a shame "Gods and Monsters" did not receive as much recognition as it deserved. Thank goodness that McKellen did receive the proper recognition he deserved and of course Fraser continues to awe us with his talent in his many other films.  Go see "Gods and Monsters" and experience the fun for yourself.
