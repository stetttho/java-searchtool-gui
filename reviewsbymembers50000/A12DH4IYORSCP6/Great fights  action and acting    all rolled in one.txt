 Ricardo Montalban made this movie for me. He played Khan, a revenge minded individual hellbent on destroying his enemy/nemesis, James T. Kirk. Almost, literally, playing the part of Captain Ahab from the classic tale, "Moby Dick", who is obsessed with destroying the white whale (Kirk). Montalban's great performance, I felt, helped push the other lead actors to perform to their fullest potential. Shatner did a wonderful job. His best of all the Star Trek films.  The dialogue between all the characters, especially all the classic literature quotes, was written and performed beautifully. "Revenge is a dish best served cold."  Amazing line and delivered beautifully by Moltalban. The film had a great story line and non stop action between two bitter rivals. I recommend this film to all, Trekkies or not. Enjoy
