 I didn't know what to expect when I first purchased this graphic novel. I heard so many good things about it from friends. They would say it was a terrific book about Superman without actually having the real Superman in it. WHAT?  After having read it, I completely understand what they meant and loved every moment of reading it.  A classic superhero tale that allows you, the reader, to feel what it is like to have powers and be afraid to share it with the world.  Each significant chapter takes places years apart from the last one to show you how much the character has grown and become even more comfortable with his abilities and even more scared someone will find out and kidnap his family.   I recommend this book highly. A perfect superhero book for any comic book fan, whether you like Superman or not.
