 I CAN NOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS BOOK!!! Ian Flemming has such a flair for writing that his ultimate gentleman spy character, James Bond, doesn't appear until after the first 80 or so pages and the book NEVER falters.  Extremely rich character and story plot. The maniacal villian, Red Grant, whose only objective and ultimate desire is killing. The drop dead beauty, Tania, whose job is to seduce 007. The toad like female villan, Rosa Klebb, who lives for cunning and torture. The organization, SMERSH, and their deadly plan of mayhem and destruction towards the British Secret Service.  One of the best spy stories ever written, also one of the best James Bond movies translated form an Ian Flemming book. A spy story to the extreme. Simple premise yet hard to forget even months or years later.  I have read this book 3 times in the last 12 years. It has never failed me yet. For those reading this fine novel for the first time, I am jealous. You are in for a good time. Enjoy.
