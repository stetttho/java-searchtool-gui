 Superman The Movie is still the best superhero movie to date.  Thank the director, Richard Donner, for maintaining as close as possible, to the comic book storyline and introducing us to then newcomer Christopher Reeve. Reeve's portrayal of a humble, quirky, klutzy Clark Kent and dynamic, powerful, might makes right "man of steel" is dead on. Perfect casting. The music provided us with a nice feel for the movie. Excellent soundtrack. The Superman/Lois Lane love theme showing them flying through the night sky was my favorite. Damn good job for a 1978 film. Superman the Movie is a film that fills you with a yearning to be like it's main character. Looked up to, powerful and super. It is a very well made movie and even more so now with it's new features and deleted scenes on DVD. "The Gauntlet" scene is incredible. I love the screen tests.  Superman the Movie is still the king of superhero movies.
