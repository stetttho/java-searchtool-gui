 Besides the obvious that this is an amazing movie, it's the soundtrack that really does it for me. It just adds to the richness of the characters and their storylines. The fight scenes are so much more intense hearing Wagner in the background. Excellent acting job by Nigel Terry portraying Arthur at 16 all the way to his death as an old man at the hands of his only son. The rest of the cast was equally good including many newcomers such as Liam Nisson, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren and Gabriel Byrne. All very popluar actors today and they can all credit this movie as their stepping stone.  This movie has always been one of my favorites even when I had first viewed it as a young boy twenty years ago. To this day I still consider it one of the best.  SIR LAUNCELOT OF THE LAKE ABSOLUTELY RULES.
