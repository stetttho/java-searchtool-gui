 Superman is the classic all American hero whose origin desperately needed a new millenium upgrade. Superman : Birthright does exactly that without compromising any of the critical fascets that makes Superman the great hero we are all familiar with, while adding new twists to keep any reader glued to the pages wondering what will happen next.  The book starts on Superman's homeworld, just before the planet explodes, and allows you to feel the heartache and desperation Kal-El's parents go through in sending their only child off into the  unknown universe alone. You feel for his earth parents, and their fear of Clark's secret being known, and possibly having their adoptive son taken from them.  Lex Luthor has always been an intriguing villian, and he is never more so compelling, and brilliant, and dark as he is in this book. Lex's genius is the key in helping Superman understand his true origin and background, which Lex also uses to his advantage to make the citizens of the world fear and distrust the man of steel. It's a great plot, in the story, which just intertwines the two bitter enemies even more.   This book is a classic story re-told, and upgraded wonderfully. It's a great read, and comes highly recommended.
