 Well if there's one thing republican pundits have figured out how to do, it's how to make a lot of money by selling a stack of pages with a liberal bash on the cover.  It's sad though because the liberal bashes on these books aren't even clever anymore.  What I have noticed though is the " We Hate Liberals" books have gone from passing us off as "crazy tree-huggers that can safely be ignored as the minority" to "the liberals that are close to taking back the White House with their vast left-wing conspiracy."  If there is one thing to learn from the plethora of liberal bashing books published in the past few years it's that the authors are starting to get scared now because they realize their party is falling apart from the corruption, religous value competition, and the continuing failure of the economy.  That's right - we liberals do have a vast conspiracy - to get this country turned around and back on the productive track that was derailed in 2000 when general Bush came to town.   Everyone knows what is going to be inside of this book, there's nothing in there that Ann Coulter hasn't already whined about. If you have to read a review to figure it out then you really shouldn't be reading this book - or any other book for that matter - It might just make your head explode.
