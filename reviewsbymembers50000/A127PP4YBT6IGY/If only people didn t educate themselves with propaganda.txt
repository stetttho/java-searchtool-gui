 If only people would educate themselves with unfiltered information, or even semi-factual information, I would not have to read a review of this book by a man (Mr. Lee) that thinks the "liberal supreme court" wrote racism into the constitution with the "monstrous criminal 14th amendment."  If he had been awake in his 5th grade social studies class he would know that congress enacts amendments to the constitution and like it or not, the 14th amendment isn't going anywhere.  If some some of these reviewers, such as Mr. Lee, hadn't dropped out of high school to fix pot-holes for a living, they might have discovered that the supreme court is mostly republican, only a couple of justices were appointed by democratic presidents.  How dare those liberal justices put an end to slavery with the 14th amendment and Brown v. BOE, right Albert?  It makes me sick that people would use even this book to suggest reinstituting slave trade by criticizing the court's overrulling of Dred Scott!  And I don't know Newt personally but I'm pretty sure he never said in this book that the 14th amendment "removed God from America" (unless God = racial segregation or lack of due process of law)  Did I fall asleep and wake up in 1850's Alabama?  I don't even know where to begin so I won't... The bottom line is: Buy this book if you want some far-right, conservative rhetoric preached back to you without acquiring any intellectual net gain.  As for myself, this crazy slave-masta-hatin liberal is going to law school tomorrow where I plan to educate myself with facts and the reality of the constitution, law, and society of this great country which I do in fact love and cherish. (That's right... Contrary to the opinions of a few lunatics reviewing this book I can love the United States w/o loving slave trade, fear, hatred, and most importantly, rednecks that unfortunately manage to breed at such frighteningly high rates)
