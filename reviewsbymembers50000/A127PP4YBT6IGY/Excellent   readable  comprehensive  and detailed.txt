 I knew this was a good supplement when I read the section detailing US v. Nixon in the executive powers chapter and then my prof's lecture the next day was almost identical.  I wondered if she was reading this book too.  There is plenty of good explanations on the historical trends of the commerce clause, judicial powers, executive powers, the most important amendements, and many more.  The only section lacking is in the executive detention powers because a couple of cases have come up since 2002 with regard to the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan.  However, this is the only content that this book is lacking.  This con-law supplement is more up to date and accurate than most others I've seen.  I can say that this book is very detailed, it has an independent discussion on each significant constitutional case as well as topical discussions and explanations of the political history leading up to and in between the cases.  Highly recommended for any constitutional law class!
