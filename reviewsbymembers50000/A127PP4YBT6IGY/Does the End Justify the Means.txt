 Perhaps if Stark had not taken such an absolutist stand on the Christian foundations of the developed world I could take his book half seriously.  It is terribly unfortunate however that this book was written starting with the conclusion followed by justifications picked and chosen, with any conflicting facts ignored, all for the sake of a predetermined conclusion.  I guess as a Christian, the ends justify the means in Starks' effort to paint everything positive in the world with Christian colors.  Take the entire Greek and Roman civilizations for instance.  They are both written off as non-scientific failures (waisting their time with art and frivolities) in comparison to the Western European civilizations of 1000+ years subsequent.  How can you compare 15th Century European achievements with the Greeks and Romans who were unrivaled in their arts, civil engineering, and military accomplishments compared to any other people of their time.  Apparently Stark is unconvinced, or just chooses to ignore these accomplishments as contrary to his thesis.  Without diminishing the achievements of Christians in the history of our world's development, I can't help but recognize the recent attempts of the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States to hinder scientific theory and exploration.  I have trouble taking a book seriously that lays all credit for the world's scientific accomplishments on a religious people of which a growing portion in the United States attempt to simplify or just plain rid our world of any scientific or other scholarship that finds itself in conflict with a religious text translated into the King James version of the Bible.  Somehow the book of Genesis has returned to replace all of the scientific success Stark's book alleges to be the result of generations of Christians' logically reasoned brilliance.  I only wish that the Christians of today would attempt to live up to the recognition given to them by this book.
