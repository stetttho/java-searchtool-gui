 Having not read the philosophical works of Sartre or  Kierkegaard in years I thought I would reintroduce myself to existentialism through literature before re-opening Being and Nothingness.  I was very pleased with what I found.  The Trial reads very clearly and at only 300 pages it goes by very fast.  More specifically though, it starts out confusingly but don't give up because, although all of your answers won't be answered, the plot becomes clear.    Because I have a legal eduation I was worried that I would be frustrated with the inaccuracies of the critique on the legal world (a very depressing and scary critique I might add)  But I was not, sure K.'s journey was quite fantastic but I read it as a warning to us of what beauracracy can become at its worst (as existentualists love to remind us).  Besides that, Kafka himself was a lawyer and did an excellent job balancing the legaleze with the layman's language to allow us all to understand the system he was battling.  Bottom line, if you aren't sure whether to read The Trial, go ahead and read it becuase it won't amount to a great investment of time or energy and leaves you with great questions to ask of yourself and of the government.
