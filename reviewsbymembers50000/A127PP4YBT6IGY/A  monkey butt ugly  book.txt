 As my title hopefully conveyed, this book is full of that fun 13 year-old-boy language that I used in middle school when talking with my immature buddies about body parts we learned about in health class.    Unfortunately, the author of "They Just Don't Get It" is not in middle school - he is 29 year veteran and a high ranking member of our military.  For some examples of what the New Republic call's Col. David Hunt's "unintentional hilarity", Col. Hunt describes the Patriot Act as "monkey-butt ugly,"  "We have been as limp [on the war on terror] as an old man in need of Viagra." Some great names the Colonal comes up with for Democrats are: "Sandy 'I-Ain't-Going-to-No-Stinking-Vietnam Berger," "Bill 'I-Did-Not-Have-Sex-with-That-Woman' Clinton," and  "President Jimmy 'I-Should-Have-Stayed-a-Peanut-Farmer' Carter."  If this is your idea af a good read, then please read it because if you're so entrenched in liberal bashing to find this amuzing then I'm not going to change your mind, but please stay away from any activities that might have a deleterious effect on us grown-ups that chose to graduate from right-wing middle school.
