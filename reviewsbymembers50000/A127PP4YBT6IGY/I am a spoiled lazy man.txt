      I read Upton Sinclair's The Jungle the summer after my first year of law school and although I felt over-worked and tired from my first year of intense studies, that feeling changed immediately after begginning this book.  I realized how easy we have it today when I compared my life to those of the immigrants in Chicago's meat processing industry.  18 hour days for pennies an hour, severed limbs, and no chance at owning property - that was the life at the turn of the 20th century for the meat packers of Chicago.       I found myself cheering for the characters when they got a promotion, then felt extreme anger and frustration at their next inevitable pitfall.  The book will get at you, no matter how tough your skin, but that's the sign of a good book as far as I'm concerned.       This is an immensely important book, both for its unique historical significance (few people of that time ever cared to set foot in the packing towns, let alone write a book on the filth, violence, poverty, and corruption) and for Upton Sinclair's brilliant storytelling.  This is one of the best told stories about one of the worst situations overlooked by the ruling class of our country.  Let it stand as a reminder to us all of what must not be allowed to happen [again] in a civilized society.
