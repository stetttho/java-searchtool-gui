 Nancy Grace has co-authored a book decrying the negative influence of 24/7 media and celebrity defendants?!?!  She made her millions by slinging mud at celebrity defendants, convicting them on T.V. before they've even been arrested.  You need look no further than the cover of the book, which was actually authored by Diana Clehane, but whose name and photo do we see? - one that sells books - Nancy Grace's.  I have to agree with Ms. Clehane and Ms. Grace on one point:  We should get rid of the cable shows focusing hour-after-hour on particularly celebrated criminal cases.   But they missed the target in the first part of their book's title... Our focus should not just be on "high-priced defense attorneys" but high-priced, million-book-selling, T.V. drama queens that proclaim their distorted ideas of "justice" as a prosecution system, absent defenses; one where no man is innocent - we're all guilty if she makes that her almighty determination.  Our legal system is not, and should not be, a prosecution mill Ms. Grace.
