     This author is said to be a strict constitutionalist?  What is a strict constitutionalist?  Someone that believes in interpreting the constitution literally?  That is not possible, nor was the constitution meant to be taken literally when it was written.   	As I read through this book's reviews it saddens me that so many people are "learning for the first time about the US supreme court" from political propaganda.  This book is barely more of an educational resource than a Michael Moore film or an Ann Coulter book.  If you are looking for some good right wing propaganda, this may be it, just please don't treat it as a beginners guide to the Supreme Court.  Try taking a constitutional law class or at least look at a con-law book before or after reading this book to get both sides of the story.  I also recommend reading the FULL text of supreme court rulings rather than relying on an author with a conspiracy theory to tell you what the justices said and why they said it.       Throughout history, the constitution was always considered a living document that would conform to the times without losing the principles our country was founded upon.  Now presidents harp that the supreme court is taking their wartime powers away and taking religion out of the constitution that was placed there by the founding fathers.  Let me tell you what the constitution says about religion and military powers.  The constitution says nothing about the religion of this country except that we have freedom of religion (In fact, many founding fathers were deists, not Christians).         All the constitution says about the president's wartime powers is this: "The president shall be commander in chief of the army, navy, etc." Article II sec.2 cl.1.  He has no power to declare war or make rules about the capture of war criminals. All of those duties are given to the Congress in Article I of the constitution.  So why is it that war means we obey the president no matter what?  Because any president would like more discretionary powers so if  the president can convince the public that "commander and chief" means "unquestioned presidential power during time of war," then he gets to bypass the traditional separation of powers as long as we're at war.         President Clinton attempted to avoid a civil lawsuit while he was president - it says nothing about that in the constitution.  President Nixon attempted to avoid handing over evidence necessary for a criminal trial - the constitution doesn't say anything about a presidential privilege for that.  President Truman attempted to take control of the steel industry during wartime - where does it say in the constitution that the president can take over private businesses during time of war - it doesn't.  In all of the above situations the US supreme court told the president NO because he was trying to take more power than was vested in him by the constitution.  I want to hear any "strict constitutionalist" explain how the president could take the initiative to do any of the above under strict constitutional authority.  The only way to identify presidential powers during wartime or any other war time is to interpret the constitution.  The text of the constitution cannot cover every area of action possibly taken by each and every public official in every branch of the federal government.  The president will say "Commander and Chief" means he can do whatever he wants to do as long as he uses the label "duties of the commander and chief" but that is interpretation of the terms commander and chief, not direct textual constitutional authority.          Congress and the president are not responsible for determining what powers are theirs, the constitution grants that responsibility to the courts.  Because it is not the president's job to determine what powers are his, he takes as much liberty with the law as the courts will allow, then the court gets a bad rap for stepping in.  The founding fathers gave us a supreme court to interpret how the constitution should apply in unforeseen situations and to dole out the power as the constitution calls for it to be doled out.  In fact, the supreme court exercises self-restraint (you don't see that happening in congress and by the president very often) The court will refuse to hear cases if the constitution does not give them the power to hear it.       If the supreme court is not acting within the scope of its power, the president and congress may appoint new members, grant pardons, amend the constitution, re-size or re-structure the court, impeach judges, even determine the justices salaries.  Clearly it is not only the US Supreme Court that is taking over all the governmental power in the country and running it into the ground.  Each branch checks the others.  And if our country was really being run into the ground by the supreme court, the legislature could take measures necessary to remove justices through impeachment or otherwise.                     It is true that the supreme court sometimes doesn't agree with the actions of the president or the legislature but that is their job.  As Mr. Levin would have to agree, we have a tripartite government and each branch is responsible for checking the two other branches.  That doesn't mean that when a democratic or republican president holds office, it is the court's duty to bow down to whatever party holds the office at the time.  The supreme court has justices appointed by various presidents spanning from the left to the right of the political spectrum.  That is the beauty of the supreme court.  The executive branch is homogenous so there is nobody there to protect the minority that did not vote for him (there are usually tens of millions that find themselves in the political "minority" that need protection just as much as the majority).  Our country's checks and balances were instilled by the founders so that the minority is not forgotten by our an executive government that only looks out for its own and its constituents well-being.  If we didn't care about the separation of powers in our country we would be living in a democratic dictatorship.              Who is supposed to be interpreting the laws and determining if they comport with our constitution if not the supreme court?  Perhaps the president? Some tripartite government that would be!  Or maybe you would rather the legislature check the constitutionality of the laws it creates.  That would ensure us that no laws were ruled unconstitutional.  While we're at it, why don't we let defendants in court interpret and apply the laws that govern them - probably won't result in too many convictions; or the next time you are falsely accused of a crime, we'll let the prosecutor interpret and apply the law without judicial discretion - bet you won't walk free.            The executive or legislative branch being granted the duty to check and balance themselves is as far from the intent of the founders as you can get.  Sometimes laws are held unconstitutional, this is as bright and strong a sign as any that our government is alive and thriving the way it was supposed to operate.  If the day arrives when the US Supreme Court isn't allowed to find laws unconstitutional or presidential actions unconstitutional we will no longer be living in the glorious constitutional democracy that I know and love.  I hope that I don't see that day.
