 The chess player is introduced to a tactic that will knock your socks off. I just spent a week getting through the introduction and learning what this tactic is all about and I was in complete awe of what this tactic can really do for you! It's the type of thing you may not have to use the majority of the time, but just knowing how it works may come through for you just when you thought you had no other hope. If you like jaw-dropping surprises I highly recommend you make this book part of your arsenal!  (August 25, 2005) The really great thing (and even more practical) thing about this book is it's bonus. The last quarter of book deals with a tactic call the single bishop mate. It shows a pattern that you'll have to recognize (it's more likely to come up in a late middle game or endgame). The 2 themes addressed there (Cordes' and Troitzky's) will help you understand it very well as Charushin trains you. This too is one of those things that's very nice to know if you ever come across it in a game, especially in a tournament. Learn it!!!
