 This is a real eye-opener to the power of one pawn (not talking about one particular pawn).  It is akin to the fast break in basketball. This book shows how you can take advantage of the opportunity, should it arise, to march a pawn to the seventh rank and make your opponent worry until the end or to make a pawn crossover into the superpowers of the queen by promoting on the eighth rank. I'm sure you'll try to enact this tactic on your own after reading this review, but get this book and you'll know all it's little nuances.
