 My title is a maxim that Clason wrote in the inside title page of this book.  This is truly my favorite book on how to handle money in your life! Clason uses the language of the King James Version of the Bible (although this book is not at all biblical) to create anecdotes set in ancient Babylon that tell you (the modern-day reader) how to handle your money. The amazing thing is that the advice is not at all outdated. It's right on the mark and shows money knowledge that hardly is taught in school. It's easy to read and understand and highly entertaining. In fact, one of its stories, "The Luckiest Man in Babylon" is almost enough to bring you to tears. It is shown in this book that when you are in debt, you are a slave to what it is that you agreed to go into debt for and you must pay it off to regain your freedom (are you a five-year slave to a car [or the institution that financed it] like I was?).  Look at the state of the nation's economy and you'll see we live in a nation of slaves.   That's why you must get the reverse into action; make money a slave that is working for you.   Many people have heard the popular phrase from this book, "pay yourself first." I highly suggest you read this book first so you can see how you should go about paying yourself first; there is a method to it. This book is truly a classic and should be required reading for all classes on money or for anyone going into business for oneself. If you're getting into Network Marketing then you've really got to read this book.
