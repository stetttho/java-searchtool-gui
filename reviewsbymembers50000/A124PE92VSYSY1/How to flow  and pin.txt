 I have over 15 chess books and I can truly say that this is the only one that is the most FUN!  I approached the 70 games in this book by studying one game per day over & over (what's 2 months! ). Through reading this  book, I really got a much better concept of one of my martial arts  concepts: use the flow. I really wasn't looking for that at all, but by the  time I got to the third game "the flow" of how to reach checkmate  just hit me like that big ocean wave sweeping away John Ritter at the  moment he shouted, "THAT'S IT! " in the movie  "Skindeep". I had a lot of knowlege from other books that started  out with diagrams of a game already in progress as the author's way of  teaching a point, but this book excellently shows you various methods of  how to arrive at the points to which many of my favorite chess authors  delineate.  You really have to be aware of a very good "unspoken"  point that this book brings out: since it's typical for so many of us  sub-grandmasters to struggle with winning an endgame (many times to no  avail without having read Lev Alburt's "Just the Facts") then you  can use the various techniques mentioned in "Power Mates" to  (attempt to) checkmate the opponent in under 30 moves; ideally entirely  avoiding the endgame. Pinning was a very often-mentioned technique (go, get  this book to find out others).  Yes, it's a good book for begginers who  already know how to play chess, but please don't go in to any tournaments  until you have thoroughly covered Jeremy Silman's "How to Reassess  Your Chess". And one more point:  Next time you play chess, remember  to have fun!  Laugh, even, for crying out loud!
