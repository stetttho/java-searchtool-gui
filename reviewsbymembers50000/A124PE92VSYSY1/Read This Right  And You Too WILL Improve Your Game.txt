 This Chess book is so exhilarating that I actually feel COMPELLED to write a review on it. I won't bother repeating the information in the accompanying reviews.  First of all, in the overall introduction of the whole book, it is suggested that as you progress through the games, you choose the winner (or, in the case of a drawn game, the stronger player) and cover his moves with a card (I folded "Sticky Notes" in half and stuck them on vertically). Then, based on your analysis of the position and the game, announce or write down your move and compare it to the actual move.  Granted, this will slow down your progress through the book by great proportions, but, by even greater proportions, it will improve your chess game. That method is called the Tactical Vision Exercise. I took (notice I'm not saying, "...it took me") from around early April 2001 to February 17, 2002 to complete the book doing it this way and my chess understanding has become improved and clarified more than 100-fold (I took about 1 to 2 hour sessions of this at least once or twice per day).       Please don't become critical or skeptical when I tell you that I have lost quite a few games of my own in my trek through this book; after all, chess is a mentally demanding game. But, I have also won many more games against strong opponents than I have in the past.  That says a lot for that exercise, but, to do that with this 3-in-1 book in particular, I believe, is an extremely required activity for any good amateur wanting to improve even more greatly in chess, whether to increase your chances at casual victories or to win in more tournament games!      Speaking of tournaments, this book also gives you tremendous insight to what goes through a top-level player's mind as the tournament progresses; it's more than just a series of games. Furthermore, the editors (or was it just Mr. Tykodi?) at various points throughout the book, did an excellent job at providing improved suggestions (moves, that is [whether from a computer or from their own analysis]) where Mr. Purdy (with all due respects) may have been a bit short-sighted.        And then there are the openings!!   If you crave openings knowlege and tips, this is truly a recondite handbook to a few of the classically popular ones; the Sicilian only showed up in the Spassky versus Fischer match. I had always been one to spurn the Slav, but, it was definitely the most popular one among Euwe and Alekhine.      I had not studied many Fischer games at all before my journey through the "How Fischer Won" section of this book. And now after playing through his games (via tactical vision), I must say he is a "mad genius" on the chessboard!! Many of his moves left my mouth wide open in awe! I had studied chess consistently for at least 5 years before this book and never have I come across any player more outrageously spectacular than Bobby Fischer; keep in mind I've always been of the "don't believe the hype" mentality. But, I'm from Missouri, and he definitley Showed Me!!  He shows that you shouldn't shut a move out of your mind simply because you see that your piece will be captured; play it through in your mind first and calculate beyond that!    Don't be afraid at all to mark in this book like crazy; it's really the only way to imprint the information on your brain and it'll make review of the book much easier (I can't imagine going through this book word-for-word and move-by-move again). It is truly a journey.
