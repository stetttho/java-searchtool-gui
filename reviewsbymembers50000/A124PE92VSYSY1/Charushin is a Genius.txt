 After studying this book's introduction very, very carefully you can pick up some tips to enhance your basic chess middlegame play.  Using that knowledge as you play through a game or two in this book over and over day by day can do wonders for your surprise springing ability!  You must be patient with yourself, though, as you branch out into the real world of over-the-board chess and lose game after game in trying to win with this "jaw-dropping" tactic! The instruction you receive from Charushin (after the introduction) is strictly through stark notation of games. But, being that you understand the complete idea of Alekhine's Block after reading the introduction, you come to see that Charushin really didn't need to weigh down this slim gem of a chess book with commentary on other aspects of the game. Your first impression after seeing the multitude of stark chess notation might lead you to think otherwise, but, I can see how Charushin did a good job in his categorizing the games which leads to understanding the main idea; Alekhine's Block.        I would have to further say a big BEWARE to chess beginners and say be honest with yourself and don't read this book if you are a beginner. Using Alekhine's Block (and even learning how to use it through this book) takes some understanding of chess so that you can use it effectively; you need to understand what's going on in the chess play that leads up to Alekhine's Block!! You also have to know when not to even try to use Alekhine's Block.
