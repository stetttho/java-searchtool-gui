 I first bought this compact disk in 1988. I have recently put it on to listen to while I was studying a chess book. Instead of changing this disk when it was finished, I let it play... over and over again. It reminded me of the good times back when I first bought it back in 1988... and you know what?  Back then I let it play over and over again,  enraptured by the talent of this pianist!!!  That "Yarey" is the jam!!!!!!  I've encountered so much since then that makes this acoustic journey a Diamond of Gold; through having the pleasure of meeting and hanging out with Spyro Gyra, I've actually met Joel Rosenblatt who does an excellent drumming job on this CD. Through studying perfect pitch and relative pitch in the cassette courses of David L. Burge I find it a true pleasure to be able to analyze as well as thoroughly enjoy these masterpieces of this piano genius.  And through developing a love of Tania Maria (for which I hold Michel Camilo responsible) and also a fluency in Portuguese, there's a much deeper place in my heart for "Pra Voce".  I know this review comes 13 years later and has an extremely rare chance of being seen, but, just take time to realize that out of all my 200 plus CDs and cassettes, this is the first one to make me take time out to compose an Amazon.com review. Doesn't that tell you something?
