 This book was extremely helpful in improving my chess game. I like the vehement style of writing that Jeremy uses, ("When I say you must, I mean you must."). I see many of my fellow reviewers lambast Jeremy for his Typos (and they should be corrected in a new edition [with two indices  of players and openings, might I add]), but it is very helpful and useful  that he expressed clarity and freshness in explaining the most important  parts of the book. (There are a lot of dry chess readings througout history  and I'm glad Jeremy, Bruce Pandolfini and Lev Alburt are aware to keep  things fresh and lively).  I was ready to tout this book as the best right  along with some of my five-star yeilding cohorts until I follwed through  with Jeremy's suggestion and read "The ART of the Middlegame" by  Paul Keres and Alexander Kotov.     This old book is MUCH MORE thorough  than "How to Reassess Your Chess" in describing 1) planning in  particular openings, 2)attacking in relation to the board's castled  positions and 3)central pawn topography. But, it is an excellent idea to  tie thoughts from these two books together; Jeremy's book does cover MANY  OTHER planning issues that aren't in "The ART of the Middlegame."  Bottom line: Ingest Jeremy's book and improve greatly. But, Ingest it along  with "The ART of the Middlegame" and tell the world of chess to  be very afraid of you. (Here's a tip... (read my Amazon review of Bruce  Pandolfini's "Power Mates"). My review WILL give you some Ideas!
