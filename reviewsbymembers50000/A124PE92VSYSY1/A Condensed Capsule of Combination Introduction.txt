 A chess genius friend of mine from Cuba (that should tell you something right there!) was the first to introduce this slim gem on chess improvement to me (circa June of 2000). You see, in Cuba there is still a great deal of reverence for the late GREAT Jose Raoul Capablanca. This friend of mine (named Alex {Alejandro}) had been TRAINED in chess as a youngster in Cuba at a chess academy that pays tribute to Capablanca. Alex sees with great depth the position on the chessboard and in record time. One day, after one of his many victories over me, he handed me his own "How Not To Play Chess" and said, "I think you could learn from this. It's the only chess book I've ever read." Now, I have written everything in this review up to this point, not "to pat my friend on the back" (O K that's part of it!), but, so that you can go through the same thought process I did after I completed this book the first time (I have read it at 3 different times over the past two years; the third time was just recently from February 18 through March 8). This is the only book Alex has read?!?!?!?! Since he's so good at the game, that fact alone tells me a lot about this book.     I would have to say this book introduces chess players to their own tendency toward mishaps; no matter what level you may be; even beyond 1800. You can improve a lot when you keep in mind the author's intention that he has written in the book's introduction. The part that deals with the 3 types of analyses and then planning is very important to know like the back of your hand. However, I am critical of the author's tone of voice throughout the book, as he seems to wonder why all chess players aren't able to see what an expert like himself sees. The book is generally easy to read, but at times the writing becomes rather cumbersome. I also am critical of how the author assumes that the reader, whom he is thinking is a beginner or amateur in chess, even knows what a combination is! I myself had absolutely no problem with his instruction on combinations, but I have to say it was a bad idea to just dive into talking about combinations in the way that the author does without explaining at all what a combination is. I started reviewing this book again a day after finishing "Extreme Chess" by C.J.S. Purdy (Read my review!) and afterwards my understanding of that "chess experience" I had just undergone (and of chess itself) solidified and clarified even more so!!  This book is so thin that reading it thoroughly again at about 6 month intervals (until you've really got it down pat EACH TIME) is something I highly recommend.                                     Take note that this third time around I got a pencil and paper and transposed all the book's dreaded descriptive notation into bi-column algebraic notation; I would recommend that you do the same. It will help your retention of the book's teachings. I think the chess quizzes at the end should have made specific mention of what principles were being addressed as you go over the answers; but definitely try to figure out the answer before looking at it. All in all, this is a good introduction into combinations, but beginners should pursue more instruction on combinations after reading this.
