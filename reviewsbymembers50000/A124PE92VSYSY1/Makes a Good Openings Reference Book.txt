 I got this book just to have a book with some lines that were more up to date than "The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings" by Reuben Fine... This book is NOT for beginners or newly-achieved amateurs. Each openings chapter gives a short essay on the idea of the opening, but I would definitely have to direct anyone pursuing greater openings understanding to Reuben Fine's book, "The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings". Nunn's book makes a great reference book for openings, but one must realize that today's chess tournament life is constantly in pursuit of an opening that is more surprising or forgotten (thus newer or older respectively) than what was played in the few previous years...Don't take up a lot of your time trying to get through every move of even one chapter of this book. Just use it as a reference book.
