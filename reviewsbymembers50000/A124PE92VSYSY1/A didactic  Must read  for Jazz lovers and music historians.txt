 As a Jazz lover, I can't help but consider this book a time machine into the past of jazz. I just finished reading it entirely for the second time (April & May of 2004). The first time I read it was 12 years ago (Spring of 1992). I have collected 3 Miles Davis box sets and a lot of his compact discs in those 12 years, so reading the autogbiograpy this time around was much more like watching a movie.        I, myself, have also become much more of a musician in the  past 12 years, so I found the book to be very didactic when Miles shared his thoughts on musical subjects such as the Egyptian mode, the modal conceptualization of songs (all the songs on "Kind of Blue"), using the Fender Rhodes electric piano to cushion his sound, and more.      For those who love John Coltrane, this book makes you feel even the slightest sense of knowing him a little; his extreme dedication to practicing and his repenting reassessment of his own life. Miles became good friends with Coltrane after he hired him into his band, yet they didn't spend much time together where  music was not concerned. Miles describes Trane's death as if it happened yesterday and it's extremely interesting to "hear" Miles  tell where Trane was musically right before he died in relation to the racial & social strife that the United States was experiencing in the 60's (this is even more poigniant when you have heard Trane's music from that period [read my review on "John Coltrane The Classic Quartet-The Complete Impulse Studio Recordings). I find it ironic that later in the book Miles mentions that he couldn't stand Trane's quartet at this period.        This is another major exciting thing about the book; it gives insight on other music greats that Miles knew personally, like Charlie Parker (especially), Gil Evans, drummer, Philly Joe Jones, Billie Holliday and many others.     The part where Miles tells what he went through as a heroine junkie is really heart-wrenching, and when he overcame that addiction, you really see and feel his cold-turkey withdrawl; he  overcame it out of self-determination.         The last chapter of the book is a look into Miles' thoughts on life, women, racism, etc. He is quite the activist; he never hated white people out of racism. He had an aversion to white people because of all the racism that was enacted upon him.        This book is musically and historically tremendous!!!
