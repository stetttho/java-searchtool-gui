 I have studied all five of Charushin's Tactician's Handbooks and this one is my favorite. In the introduction, there's a quote from Saviely Tartakower that alludes to the concept of, "What you've learned is safe is, in fact, not safe, so you still have to keep your guard up" (my words). This book does a wonderful job of teaching Lasker's Combination and you should also look at it as Lasker's Principle. You do have to practice it through actual play over the board. I've noticed that more experienced players tend to fianchetto when they see the King's Bishop getting posted, but you have to remember this is a strong attack being set up.  I have won a few games using this tactic (of which you do have to know cold the certain nuances) and have enjoyed watching the expression of my opponent go from consternation to great concern as he tries to buckle down and plan a winning counter.  To be honest, I have also lost quite a few games in attempting this tactic; you must practice it. However, losses notwithstanding, the training you undergo as you proceed through this book really gets you to think in such a different way even if your opponent becomes successful in making you do someting else. Lasker's Combination is an attack that, in most cases, has to be set up specifically, but there are very jaw-dropping alternatives that come from seeing Lasker's Principle (my words).    I also just love how Charushin shares with the reader his own story of chess in his life at the beginning of the book. This book has the most "over-the-shoulder" training from Charushin compared to his other books. It is a veritable eye-opener that makes you think outside the box.
