 This is the much better sequel to The Quiet Place (which I gave 2 stars).   The writing and character development is of the high standard I expect from  Peter David.  The Black Mass, combined with the Redeemers, and Dogs of War,  made for an exciting plot with plenty of action.  I also enjoyed the  interaction between Mac, Elizabeth and Mac's other executive officer.
