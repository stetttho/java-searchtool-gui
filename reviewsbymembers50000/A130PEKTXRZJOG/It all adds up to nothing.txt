 The strength of this book is the characterizations, and all of the characters are unlikeable.  I couldn't find myself caring about what  happened to them.  Usually Rendell is good at making unbelievable  situations believable, but the plot in this novel was that of a second-rate  potboiler.  At the end of the book, I had the feeling, 'is that it?', which  is not my usual reaction to Rendell's works.  A real disappointment.
