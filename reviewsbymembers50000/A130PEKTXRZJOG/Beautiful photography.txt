 This look at selected gems in the Smithsonian collection has impressive  photography.  The text is more informative than is usual with such 'coffee  table' books.  I appreciate the fact that the book features semi-precious  stones such as opal, periodot, topaz, etc. as well as the more important  gems. After leaving the Smithsonian, I wished I could stay longer to  visit with the collection.  This book is the next best thing.
