 This is the 4th Leslie Sansone tape I've bought.  Together with the '2-mile walk', it makes a decent 1 hour workout.  This tape has some of the same participants of '2-mile walk' and, like that video, has the  participants working at different levels.  This tape is more no-nonsense  than her other tapes in that she doesn't interact at all with the  participants. There are good exercises for thighs, hips, arms, and abs,  but little for shoulders, calves, and back.  Form is stressed throughout  the video, but bad form is used for some of the ab exercises.  The  participants sometimes show appallingly bad form, which may be confusing to  a beginner. The warm-up is inadequate and the stretching is almost  nonexistent in this video, so be prepared to do these on your own.
