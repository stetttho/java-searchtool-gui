 I absolutely loved the first half of this story, then it just seemed to  run out of steam.  The novel starts at one level and just goes on and on  and on at the same level.  There's no real narrative tension and less plot  than your typical novel.  Granted, the focus of the book were the  characters, but the only character who changed substantially was Melony, a  minor character.  The main character did change at the very end, but it was  so predictable as to be laughable.  I had to force myself to read the last  third of the book and was sorry I did because there is no payoff at the  end.
