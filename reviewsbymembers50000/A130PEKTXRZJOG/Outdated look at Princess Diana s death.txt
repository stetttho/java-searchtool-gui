 This book contains many factual mistakes, but since it was written over 2  years ago, before many facts were uncovered by the French investigation, I  am not really penalizing it much for that. About half of the book  consists of background information on Dodi and Diana.  This part could have  been much shorter.  I don't need to know, nor do I care about, Dodi's  favorite pets as a child. The actual part related to the investigation  was an evenhanded treatment of the facts as they were known in 1998.  To  the authors' credit, they investigate the most wild theories in a fair  manner.  When information was not known or available, they plainly state  so.  Unfortunately, they hint darkly a few times in the book that a source  (which they can't name) tells them there is 'something big' not known about  the case.  This shot down the authors' credibility.
