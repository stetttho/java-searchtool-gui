 The purpose of this book is to rehabilitate Mr. Hewitt's image and he  doesn't succeed.  From the irrelevant title to the declarations of love  seemingly thrown in at random, this book is completely disingenuous.    The first half of the book tries to paint Hewitt as a perfect soldier.   The details of his army exploits were extremely boring and his crowning  achievement seems to be a small newspaper mention of his bravery during the  Gulf War.  This part of the book ends when he leaves the army after  receiving two rebukes from his superior officer for leaving base without  permission and having expired tags on his vehicle.  He claims to have been  drummed out of the service, which may in fact be true, but he also  minimizes these violations.  The second half of the book is a pity party  for himself because letters from Diana were stolen from his home safe,  apparently by the Mirror newspaper.  I find little sympathy for him  considering Diana asked him to destroy the letters, a fact he himself  mentions several times.
