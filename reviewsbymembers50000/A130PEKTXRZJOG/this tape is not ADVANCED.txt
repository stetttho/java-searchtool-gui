 I feel so ripped off by this video!!  It purports to be advanced, yet is far easier than the two other Sansone videos I have (2 mile walk and walk  aerobics).  The exercisers in the video are all at least 50 lbs overweight,  but for anyone with at least a basic level of fitness, this tape is  laughable.  It consists of walking in place and doing arm movements for 30  minutes.  There are none of the staples of her other videos like kickbacks,  grapevines, sidesteps, etc.   I don't have the beginner tape in this  series, but I imagine the 'exercises' consist of sitting on your couch and  having a donut!! If you are
