 There is one simple conclusion in this book:  pretty=good, ugly=bad.  The  author constantly describes the murderer in terms of his bad appearance,  e.g., short, ugly, balding.  It is interesting that almost every other male  in the book is described as being handsome.  Even the biker hitman who  testifies wearing mostly leather is depicted as a 'noble savage'.  The  murderer's daughters on the other hand, as described as blond and almost  angelic in appearance. The author alternately discribes the villain of  the piece as being a bumbling fool or a criminal mastermind, whichever fits  with the point she is currently trying to make.  She doesn't seem to  understand she can't have it both ways. All the facts of the case have  been described by the time the trial takes place, so the last half of the  book is mostly repetition.  I would have rather she delved into some of the  interesting aspects that were briefly mentioned (e.g., cocaine found in the  murder victim, the insurance company's computer system being hacked into)  rather than simply repeating, sometimes word for word, information from  earlier in the book.
