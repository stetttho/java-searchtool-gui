 I can't believe Peter David wrote this book.  The writing is so far below  his usual standard that I am at a loss.  My other problem with the book is  that the characters of NF are hardly in the book at all.  The new character  of Xyon was somewhat interesting, but not enough to sustain this cliched  story.
