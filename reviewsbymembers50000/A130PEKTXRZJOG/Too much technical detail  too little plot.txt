 There are a lot of interesting ideas in this book, but unfortunately none are fully developed.  There is very little plot and the characters, who were difficult to tell apart, are simply devices to carry out the techical  details.  The author missed a great chance here to explore the  philosophical implications of the technology.  Without knowing anything  about the author, I'd guess he writes technical manuals and this is his  first try at a novel.
