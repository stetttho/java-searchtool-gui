 This contains three games I used to play as a child in the 70s.  Connect 4 is pretty much the same as the game.  I find that I beat the 'easy' setting every time and almost always come to a draw on the 'hard' setting, I'll have to practice more.    I loved Perfection as a child, but I can't play it on GBA because the pieces are too small for me to distinguish certain of the pieces from the other.    My favorite of the three is Trouble.  I'm getting addicted.  The only problem I have is that in the single player game, the 'home base' is in the upper corner, where the slanted perspective of the board makes it a little difficult to distinguish the spaces.  I wish the 'home base' was in one of the lower corners
