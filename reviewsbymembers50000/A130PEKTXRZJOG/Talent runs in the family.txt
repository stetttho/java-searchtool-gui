 I love Jim Wright's style of writing; it is as easy as his father's.  He uses letters, unpublished writings, and his own recollections in this biography of his father.  Some of the stories, which James Herriot didn't include in his books as he thought them too outrageous, made me laugh out loud.  The book is touching as well, especially regarding his relationship with his wife.  I appreciate the honesty of the author in that he includes some potentially embarassing material regarding Herriot's health and episodes of mental illness. My one criticism is that I wished the author included less about James Herriot's friends and more about James Herriot himself.
