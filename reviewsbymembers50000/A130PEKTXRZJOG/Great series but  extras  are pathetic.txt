 Everyone knows that the series is great, so I won't belabor that point. The first season collection had some great extras--I especially liked the Ben Browder/Claudia Black commentaries.  This collection has only one commentary episode, and it was done by two technical people - no actors.  The rest of the extras feature typed-up synopses of the actors' careers, not actual interviews, and the ever-present 'conceptual drawings'.  Not even a screen-saver!
