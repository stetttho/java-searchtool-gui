 This is the story of how a doctor convicted of poisoning 6 of his  coworkers at an ambulance service managed to get job after job as a  physician.  And how he subsequently murdered up to 60 patients due to the  incompetence, arrogance, and corruption of the medical institutions and  physicians involved.  The laxness of the application and interview process  at some of the most prestigious institutions in the U.S. is exposed.  Every  single time he was suspected of foul play, the institutions involved merely  fired him, without any police involvement.  I was shocked that nurses,  patient family members and patients themselves witnessed Swango's misdeeds,  yet weren't listed to because it was their word against a  physician's. When Swango moved on to kill in small hospitals in Zimbabwe,  police officials were notified almost immediately by suspicious coworkers.   The contrast between the quick action of the medical establishment in bush  areas of Zimbabwe and the lying and covering up of U.S. establishments was  startling. The book tries to answer the question of why Swango killed and  poisoned so many people.  The book really has no conclusion other than he's  a psycopath, which is probably about as good as anyone can understand  this. Swango was sentenced to life in prison yesterday.  This book points  out there may be other Swangos out there and that's really scary.
