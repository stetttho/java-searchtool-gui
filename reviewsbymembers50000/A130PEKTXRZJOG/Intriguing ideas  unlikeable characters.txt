 The action in this book starts fast; in fact, the main idea of the story occurs on page 5.  The appealing part of the novel is the philosophical  consequences of people seeing three minutes of their life 20 years in the  future.  I thoroughly enjoyed the 'news items' at the beginnings of the  chapters.   My problem with the novel is that most of the main characters  are either unlikeable or unremarkable.  I especially found the Theo  character loathesome; I was rooting for the villain to kill him at the end.   The main character was harmless enough, but his finance was annoying.  The  only intriguing character was the 'geeky' scientist who courts the woman  who he saw in his vision of the future (making love in their lab, no  less). The dialogue in this book was somewhat stilted, but it didn't  bother me as much as the characters.
