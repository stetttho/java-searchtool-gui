 The premise of this book was exciting:  a bubble suddenly surrounds the solar system, blocking out the stars.  Is it aliens, a black hole, God ?    After the first couple of interesting chapters, the book changes directions  and becomes a dreadful technomystery.  The are consortiums and convoluted  plans within plans.  I stopped reading about half way through because I  couldn't stand it anymore.  I did thumb to the back to see what the cause  of the bubble was and it was explained in one short throw-away  paragraph. The writing here is simply terrible.  It is of the quality you  would expect from a high school writing fair honorable mention.
