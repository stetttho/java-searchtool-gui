 Inspector Morse is my favorite detective and I was disappointed in the book in that I found the mystery part to be completely boring.  The investigation and clues had no points of interest and seemed unworthy of  Morse's attention.  The highlight of the book is the interaction between  Morse and Lewis (who, to my delight, has a much bigger role than usual),  and Morse and Strange.  I was truly touched by Morse's actions  towards  Lewis and Strange at the end of the book. The writing itself was to Colin  Dexter's high standard.  I've always appreciated that he doesn't 'write  down' to the audience.  It was courageous of him to show Morse's abuse of  alcohol and drugs in such a realistic way. I give this book 1 star for  the mystery and 5 stars for everything else.
