 Before reading this book, I thought it would be exploitive for three reasons:  the cover photo, the subtitle, and the last sentence of the introduction 'Trevor's story may, he believes, bring a sense of closure for  William and Harry...'.  However, this is truly Mr. Rees-Jones' story.   Princess Diana is simply portrayed as a pleasant woman who was one of the  party he was to guard.   The book tells how Mr. Rees-Jones went from  being bodyguard to a relative unknown to a potential suspect in one of the  most intense investigations of the twentieth century.  The first third of  the book details the prior month or so of his job.  This part demonstrated  the poor security work that often relied on amateurish cloak and dagger  manuevers and that proper security work was thwarted by a fatuous boss.    The second third details his recovery from his injuries.  Since he was  unconscious and then medicated for this period, his parents' story was  mostly used here.  I found this the most tedious part of the whole book;  his parents, especially his mother, are simply tiresome and of little  interest to the larger story.  The details of his facial surgeries were  fascinating. The last third concerns the aftermath of being released from  the hospital to the final decision of the judge on the case.  This part was  the most gripping for me.  The machinations of various parties to gain  control of the testimony and newspaper interviews of a man still recovering  from major trauma went so far as to be near-kidnappings.  The conflict of  interest of working for the man who was trying to prove a conspiracy theory  through his testimony was a tense situation.  I felt triumphant for him  when he finally realized he was being manipulated and quit his job.
