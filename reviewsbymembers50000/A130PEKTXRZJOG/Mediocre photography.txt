 The highlight of this book, strangely enough, is the text.  It explains  how jewelry styles changed throughout the century in an interesting way.   Unfortunately, the photographs weren't as good; they didn't accentuate the  jewels very well and were sometimes slightly out of focus and grainy.  In  the chapter on pink diamonds, many of the photographs make the diamonds  look gray.  Throughout the book, diamonds described as canary yellow look  like white diamonds.  In general, the beauty of the gems were not captured.
