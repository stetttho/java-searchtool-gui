 The most important thing to know about this book is that it is not a comprehensive guide to homemaking, rather it contains topics in which the author is interested.  The last 10 chapters are on legal issues, sometimes  not very relevant to homemaking (the author is a lawyer).  The book is  short on information on the major systems of a home, such as electricity,  heat, etc.  Plumbing only rates a two-page chapter that basically says  'call a plumber'.   There is an impressive amount of information on air  quality, allergens, food safety and related topics. Almost enough to make a  person really paranoid.  I like the author's no-nonsense approach to  cleaning.  At first I thought it was crazy to get on hands and knees to  wash a floor, but I tried it and realized how much ground-in dirt really  was on my floor.  It makes sense that you can see more dirt from 2 ft away  than 5 ft.
