 I thought Ann Rule did a good job of organizing and presenting this convoluted tale.  The book was somewhat repetitive, however. My one major  problem with the book is that it didn't explore the husband's culpability  in his children's deaths.  It is inconceivable to me that any responsible  father would leave his children in the care of an unstable woman (he tried  to commit her only three weeks previously) who he knew tried to poison him  previously.  His explanation was he thought she was 'better' and she had  never hurt the children before.  Obviously he was wrong.  It is unbelivable  that not one single person connected to the case pointed out this bizarre  logic.  I think any details on this line of questioning were probably left  out of the book to keep it going towards one angle.  I am afraid for his  surviving daughter.
