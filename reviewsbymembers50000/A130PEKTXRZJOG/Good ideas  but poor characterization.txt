 There were two main ideas in the book:  the philosophical implications of  the discovery of a 'soulwave' that exits the body after death and an AI  experiment that makes three differing copies of a human's brain to  determine what makes up a soul.    The author should have stuck to these  concepts.   The subplot regarding an affair between the protagonist's  wife and a coworker took up far too much of the book.  This subplot did  feed into the main plot, but the point was belabored.  Another subplot  involved the investigation, rather simplistic, of the murders of the  coworker and the wife's father. The dialog in this novel was very  stilted.  For example, when they weren't talking about technical concepts,  the protagonist and his AI friend interacted like teenagers, complete with  obscure Star Trek references.  I found the monologs spouted by the AI  versions of the protagonist to be the best dialog in the novel.
