 It is such a pleasure to read Rendell, I was sorry to have to reach the  end of this complex novel.  Rendell doesn't follow the usual sequence of  crime, investigation, resolution.  There are at least 6 major crimes in  this book, some related, some unrelated, and some 'red-herrings'.  One  major plotline ends halfway through the book and one major plotline starts  3/4 the way through.  You have to marvel at Rendell's expertise in tying  everything together at the end. Rendell is one of the best writers  around...in any genre.
