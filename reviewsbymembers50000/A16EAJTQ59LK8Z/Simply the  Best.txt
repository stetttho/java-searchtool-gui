 What can I say about this mouse that hasn't been said.  It's definitely the best mouse out there.  The glowing red light is awesome when your room is dark.  It's just the right amount of brightness.  It doesn't overpower the room in red but is still noticeable.  I am right handed and it fits perfectly in my hand.  A great internet feature is the 2 buttons on opposite sides of the mouse that allow clicking back and ahead.  A great time saver.  I highly recommend this product.
