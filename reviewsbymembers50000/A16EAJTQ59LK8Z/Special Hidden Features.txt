 1. Go to the special features disk on either disk one or two and highlight main menu. From here press up and the Gingerbread Man's gum drop buttons are highlighted. Press enter and Shrek will pop up and give you meaningless info about the movie. Keep selecting the buttons over and over to see all of the facts.  2. To access the Karaoke sing along on the main menu of disc 2 select the Music Note in the upper left hand corner of the screen. after you click on it Donkey will fly in the air and you'll see all the characters singing abunch of songs! (This is the same Karaoke that is easily available on disc 1. It also comes up if you watch past the credits on disc 2)  3. To see a small but still interesting DTS clip on Shrek Disc 2, simply set your player to play Title 11.  4. At Main Menu push up to Highlight DWK. This will show more bonus material like Favorite Scenes, Shreks Music Room and The Game Swamp which has three more games. If I recall, this only shows up after you've watched the movie through?  5. If you surf the titles, you can see that in the titles 22 and 23 there are two videos, one from Baja Men and the other one is the video that Smash Mouth made for the movie
