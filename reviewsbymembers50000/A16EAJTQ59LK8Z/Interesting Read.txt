 This book was a very interesting read. It recounts the storied marine corps career of the top sniper in Vietnam. Carlos Hathcock AKA "Long Trang" was a one man killing machine in the Vietnam War. The book is chock full of several great and somber stories from the War. The most interesting part of the book deals with the Elephant Valley Massacre. I don't want to ruin that part but let's just say he killed alot of people! Very good read for the Vietnam War buffs. WARNING: Do not read "One Shot, One Kill" until after this book. "One Shot, One Kill" deals with snipers from every major war and the stroy of Hathcock is repeated in several chapters.
