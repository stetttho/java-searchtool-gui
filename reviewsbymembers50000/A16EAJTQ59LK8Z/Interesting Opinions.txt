 O'Reilly breaches subjects many people are afraid to write about. His chapter on class discrimination is of particular interest. His book only gets 4 stars because of the lack of a chapter on education. He skims the education card lightly in his other chapters. I would have liked to have seen a whole chapter devoted to this important subject. I agree with most of his opinions.
