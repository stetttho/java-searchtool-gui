 I just wanted to point out to the review who claimed "This book is filled with people who got 4.5 and above GPAs and LSAT scores of 170 and better." It is IMPOSSIBLE to get a GPA of 4.5 in college. The highest GPA one can achieve in college is 4.33 and thats *if* the school awards an A+ for a grade of 100%. Most schools just award ordinary A's which caps the maximum GPA at 4.0.
