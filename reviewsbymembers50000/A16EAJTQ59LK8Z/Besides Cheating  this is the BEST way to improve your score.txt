 The best way to improve you're score on the SAT is to read this book. It is more than 10 real sats however. It also has chapters on a variety of subjects: Chapter 1: Introducing the SAT-------------------------Chapter 2: Test-Taking Strategies Chapter 3: Psyching Yourself Up-----------------------Chapter 4: About Verbal Questions Chapter 5: Sentence Completion Questions-------------Chapter 6: Analogy Questions Chapter 7: Critical Reading Questions-------------------Chapter 8: Verbal Practice Chapter 9: About Mathematics Questions---------------Chapter 10: Calculators Chapter 11: Mathematics Review-----------------------Chapter 12: Five-Choice Multiple-Choice Questions Chapter 13: Quantitative Comparison Questions---------Chapter 14: Student-Produced Response Questions Chapter 15: Mathematics Practice-----------------------Chapter 16: About the PSAT/NMSQT Chapter 17: 10 Complete, Real SATs with answer keys I recommend going over this book and learning how to do do each problem so nothing will be a shock come test day. Even if you get a question wrong don't be frustrated. Just learn how to get the correct answer on that type of question and you will be set for test day.(this strategy is primarily for the math section but works on verbal as well) *****UPDATE****** I got an 1100 on my first SAT without this book(550V, 550M). After reading this book, using my math strategy, I achieved a 1390 (620V, 770M). This book proved its value.
