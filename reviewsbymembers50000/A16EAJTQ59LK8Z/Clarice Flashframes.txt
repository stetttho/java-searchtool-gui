 1) On the second disc, go to "Breaking The Scilence". Then highlight Music, push the left key on your remote and you will see two highlighted arrows. Select the arrows this will lead you to a musical montage of Clarice Starling.  2) Put disk two in your DVD player and go to the 'DVD Credits'. On the eighth page (hit 'more' seven times). I believe one of the names on the page is 'Wes Sewell', so look for that. On that page there are some odditites in the menu system. Typically the menu options can be triggered both by scrolling to an option and hitting enter as well as hitting the number key that corresponds to it's order in the menu. In this instance hitting four is the same as hitting one (back to the main menu) and five just seems to highlight that option. But if you hit five and then scroll down six times, then to the left six times and down again six times it will open up a picture collage. There are other movements that will activate it, but that one was the first I was able to reproduce successfully. Basically you can just scroll off the option either up or down and then make some repeated movements in several directions and stumble across it. Now does anyone know who the hell the guy in the photo's is??? For all this trouble I assume he's pretty important... maybe an author or screenwriter?
