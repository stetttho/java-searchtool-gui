 On the main menu, the special features menu, language menu and the cast biography menu you will see some footprints either at the right top or the bottom of the screen. Highlight them and then press 'Enter', and you will get to see different screens with 'famous quotes' from the movie. Each of these screens contains a number of quotes and if you select a quote, the disc takes you directly to the scene in the film where the quote is coming from.
