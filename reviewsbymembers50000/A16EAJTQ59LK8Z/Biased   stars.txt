 This CD only gets 5 stars because it brings back plenty of memories when I was a production assistant on Farmclub.com. It also gets 5 stars because of its content. Where else can you get a CD with live performances by a variety of HUGE artists in different genres. The CD is a little rap heavy only because Farmclub was a little rap heavy. Pump by Bionic Jive is a highlight of the CD.
