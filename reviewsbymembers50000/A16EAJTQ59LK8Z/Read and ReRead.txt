 A great book with some great tips on daytrading(stops, gaps, etc.) A knowledge of stop losses and Gaps are two things no daytrader should be without. Learning about the 10am rule pays for the book itself! This book is an easy read, however you sould know the fundamentals of investing before you start. Warning...Not for the buy and hold idio..investor!
