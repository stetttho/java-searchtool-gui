 Montauk's book is a must have for any aspiring law student. I have two problems with it however.  1. Montauk never talks about minority admissions. Being a minority, I was hoping to gain additional insight on the whole process. I walked away empty handed. In fact the words "minority" and "URM" are not even in the index! My other beef with the book is the recommendation section.  2. Montauk printed two extremely long recommendations that he liked. The only problem is: each rec is 2000+ words! Adcoms do not want to read a novel on how good of a person you are. They want it short and sweet. Other than these 2 problems, the book is great! A highlight is the many quotes from adcoms distributed throughout the book. There are literally hundreds of quotes from adcoms showing what they prefer among their applicants.  In regards to the complaint about the book being tailored to applicants to top 14 schools-that is not true. The information provided is helpful to anyone applying law school. Sure a majority of the quotes are from adcoms from top 14 schools but what did you expect....hundreds out quotes from adcoms at Cooley and Cal Western?
