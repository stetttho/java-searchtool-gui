 I purchased the tetter twirl over a year ago and my kids loved it.  They are now 4 and 5 and they still spend at least half an hour on it everyday.  Of all the toys they have this is one of the few that has stood the test of time.  It's light weight, easy to move, and VERY durable.  It's in the same shape it was a year ago.  My 4 year old son says his favorite part of the toy is being high up in the air, and my 5 year old daughter loves spinning around and around in circles.  This toy is truly a must have.  Unlike other pricey toys, You and your children will not be disapointed.
