 I purchased this book when it first came out at a Nicholas Sparks signing.  He was an amazing man and spent about 10 minutes talking to me about The Notebook movie and his memoir which I guess has just been releasd. The Wedding isn't a great book, but it is a good book.  It takes a while to get going, but stick with it because it gets better.  The book tells about Noah's (from The Notebook) daughter and her husband Wilson.  They have been married for a while and get stuck in a rut.  Wilson senses his wife is falling out of love with him and he goes to drastic measures to make her fall in love with him all over again.  The ending will suprise you and leave you in tears.  The Wedding is not a masterpiece like The Notebook, but if you like romance it's worth reading.
