 I recently purchased this toy for my just four year old son.  He knows his colors, shapes and letter names but he is getting some basic number recognition and concept skills while playing this game.  My five year old daughter likes playing with him as well but her favorite part of playing is making up adventures about how they are going to find all the balls to open the treasure.  She has even made a treasure map for her and her brother.  This game allows them to use their imagination.  My favorite part of the game is that my two children can play this game by themselves with minimal supervision.  We have many, many games and this is the only one I have that my four year old can play and enjoy without an adult supervising.
