 (...)  We've only had this pool for a couple of weeks but my kids have used it everyday.  They are 4 and 5 and have spent hours jumping in landing on the sides of the pool and having water fights.     Set up of the pool took me less than 10 minutes.  I used my bouce around fan to fiil the air chambers about 90 percent full.  This took about 5 seconds each chamber.  Then I finished it with a regular hand pump.  The water filled up in just about 20 minutes.  The water goes to a little over a foot high, but it's still big enough and deep enough for my kids to use floaties and snorkels etc.  "Knock on wood" We haven't had any holes, leaks or anything like that. I gave it a five for educational value because I have put funnels, sieves, measuring cups etc. in the pool for my kids to become "water chemist" If you're looking for a pool that requires little maintainence, that can be drained and refilled on a daily basis, and is durable and inexpensive, this may be the pool for you.
