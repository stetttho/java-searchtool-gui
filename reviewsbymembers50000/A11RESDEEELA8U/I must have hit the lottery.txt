 I called around to a few Toys r us stores in my area and finally found one of these at the Tacoma WA store.  I got one of the last four.  My son has a small set of magnetix now and he LOVES them.  This set will be his birthday present and I know he will have hours and hours of fun playing with it.  Just a bit of advice for those of you trying to find this toy, keep calling.  This was the third TRU I called.  The other two had no idea what the toy was and when/if they would be getting some in.
