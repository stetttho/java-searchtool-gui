 I work at an elementary school and we purchased 3 of these games for rainy day recess.  The kids love it.  It's simple enough for the kindergarteners yet still enough fun for the 5th and 6th graders.  It's a lot like Jenga in that you have to choose the right rod to pull out to prevent the marbles from spilling.  However, unlike Jenga, the clean up and set up takes just a couple of minutes.  As far as durability, we've used it during recess over the past 3 months and it has stood the test of all those children so I would say it's going to last for a while.
