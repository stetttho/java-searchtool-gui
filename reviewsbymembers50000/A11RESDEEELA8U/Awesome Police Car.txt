 My son recieved this toy for Christmas.  It's been 6 months and he still plays with it.  He loves the fact that 2 rescue heros can sit in it at a time.  This toy is very durable.  It's survived being stepped on, being drug through sand and even being thrown down the stairs.  I would reccomend this for any rescue hero fan
