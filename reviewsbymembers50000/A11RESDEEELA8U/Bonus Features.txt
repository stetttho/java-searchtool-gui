 Most people buyying this DVD have probably seen most of the episodes in season ten.  The actors and characters had grown up, and it was a smart choice to end the series while they were still on top.   The first 3 dvds contain all 18 episodes, however the fourth disc is all bonus features.  This was my favorite part.  We get to watch a hilarious 40 minute gag reel including seasons 1-5 and season 10.  Some highlights of that include the guys playing jokes on each other and the girls, Jennifer Aniston using the f word quite a few times and Lisa Kudrow shouting something really funny when she's in labor with the triplets.  There are also interviews with the cast and the creators.  They talk about auditioning for their roles and what this show has meant to them.  This dvd collection is a must have for every friends fan.
