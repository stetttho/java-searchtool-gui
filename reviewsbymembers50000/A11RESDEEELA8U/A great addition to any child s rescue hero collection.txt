 My 5 year old son has had this toy for 3 months and he still enjoys playing with it.  He has almost all of the Rescue Hero vehicles and this is one of the few he uses on a regular basis.  His favorite feature is an orange button on top that causes the "feet" to pop out.  There are also 2 pinchers that unfold from the bottom that come in really handy for rescuing people or animals.  One rescue hero can sit inside and each pincher can hold another.    This toy also really allows my son to use his imagination.  He'll sit for over an hour with it and his other Rescue Hero toys rescuing his toy animals and toy cars from earthquakes, volcano eruptions and more.  This toy is super durable.  It has been stepped on, dropped and thrown down the stairs and it still looks as good as new.  Any young rescue hero fan would enjoy this toy.:-)
