 I purchased this puzzle to use with a class of Kindergarteners.  They love it!  We just finished a farm theme and this puzzle obviously fit perfectly.  The kids would work in a small group of three or four and put the puzzle together.  Some kids also decided they wanted to put the puzzle together by themselves.  One plus is that the pieces are extra thick.  This puzzle has been used A LOT, and it is still in great condition.
