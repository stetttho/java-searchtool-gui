 This is a great toy, but my almost 4 year old son hasn't got into playing with it as much as I would like.  He has a lot of the rescue hero action figures and four of the vehicles and I think he may be a little overwhelmed.  However when someone plays with him he loves it.  There are big plastic card like things you put in to change what mission the rescue heros are on.  His favorite mission is the earthquake. He likes to rescue "people" in his toy cars.  Also the talking action figures can change what mission they're on to coordinate with the command center.  The toy took about an hour to put together, and since this was a birthday gift, next time I would probably assemble it ahead of time.
