 I got this toy for my son a month ago and he loves it. The first day I bought it he played with it almost 2 hours. The only bummer is that you can't put the boat in the bath tub. It says not to on the back of the box. I let him try it once anyway and the decals started to peel. You can attach a rescue hero to the back of the boat and to the anchor. It doesn't make any sounds but it is still an excellent toy that my three year old really enjoys
