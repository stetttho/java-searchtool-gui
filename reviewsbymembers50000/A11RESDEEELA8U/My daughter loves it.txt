 This toy was number one on my 6 year old daughter's Christmas list.  She was so excited and I'm glad this toy has lived up to her expectations.  The hotel has separate rooms, including a bedroom with 2 beds, a restaurant and a hot tub.  You can also add different polly accessories to create different rooms.  The toy is so versatile.  Besides a hotel she's also created a polly shopping mall.  The roller coaster is one of my daughter's favorite features.  It's easy to use and a lot of fun.  The other polly roller coaster sets are compatible with it so we have 6 cars (instead of 2)going around.    Storage of this toy is also simple because it folds right up and takes up very little space.  It can easily be tucked into any corner.  My daughter has spent hours enjoying this toy and I would recommend for any polly fan.
