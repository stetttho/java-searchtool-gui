 This book has been described as a "Frothy Pagan Rant" and that's really about on the mark but if you're into that sort of thing it's probably right up your alley. The author is a pagan and a bee keeper so she knows the practical business of making mead right out of the comb. She's also a bit easier to understand than other authors. She includes sample rituals as well as many recipes (including one for pumpkin) and goes a bit into the legal aspects of home brewing. A good book for pagans that want a well-rounded education when it comes to mead. Non-pagans might find it a bit over the top though. Hell, I'm a druid and I think she needs to take a chill pill too.
