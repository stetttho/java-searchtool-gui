 Written specifically for starting witchcraft covens, it's insight can also apply to starting just about any organized group of folks sharing a spiritual path. It takes you through just about everything the leader of these groups would need to think about before, during and after forming up. It spends a good deal of time on how to identify the right people for your group, how to deal with mundane issues like using someone's home as a temple or how to get a separate temple area and ideas for dealing with the inevitable financial issues associated with any group. It even gets into fun activities that the group could get together and participate in. It's a must-read for anyone planning on starting his or her own church / coven / grove.
