 I have to honestly say that this is a quaint little book that's basically a compiled list of one lady's experiences with ghosts. It's entertaining at times but I honestly expected much more. Overall I was pretty dissatisfied. If you get it as a gift then consider reading it but I'm not sure I would drop my own money on this title.
