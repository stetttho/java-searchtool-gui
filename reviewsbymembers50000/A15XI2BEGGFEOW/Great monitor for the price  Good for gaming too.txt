 I've had this for about a week. I must say, this really is a nice monitor. It's crisp and clear. No ghosting. I'm a graphic designer (web) by trade so I'm super critical of colors and I'm a gamer at heart so I need performance. I ALMOST got the 21 inch big brother to this model for the extra $170ish bucks but I'm glad I went with this model. I've had no problems at all. I play World of Warcraft so in the last week's time this baby has really had a workout. I was a bit worried at first because I wanted a 800:1 or better contract and the 12ms response rate is a bit on the slow side for gaming but I can say I've been VERY pleased with this model thus far. My wife wants one now. I will say that viewing angle on this monitor is very critical. You need to use the included configuration software for best color. Amazing up grade from my old 20 inch CRT.
