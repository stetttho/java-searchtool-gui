 I expected a bit more but I admit my expectations were a bit high given that the author is a psychologist. If you're very new to psychic protection you might get some benefit but you're probably better off with another psychic shielding book. That being said, there were a few good points and perspectives and the book uses actual case-histories to make it's point which I always find interesting. If you find a cheap copy somewhere and you have the cash handy it might not be a bad read but don't lose any sleep over it. This IS a "new age fru fru" type of book. If you're looking for clinical stuff this is not what you want.
