 The mids and highs on this set is ok. Bass is ok, it's there, you can hear it but it's not as full toned as you might like.  The big problem with these was the fact that they were incredibly uncomfortable. I tried out all of the accompanying sized ear inserts and they all irritated my ears. I couldn't keep any of them in for more than 10 min without having to take them out and give my ears a rest. I really did try to give them a shot, and you could make the argument that I didn't give my ears enough of a chance to adjust but honestly, how much should they have to adjust? Technology is supposed to make life easier, not more uncomfortable.  I would pass on these. I'll be returning them shortly.
