 This is another great work. Sensei Roy Suenaka gives a no-nonsense narrative of his history with aikido as well as basic technique and training tips. There is also reference to Seunaka's friendship with one of the founders of the Shorin Ryu style of karate and Suenaka's experiences with Sensei Saotome. Great history, Great technique advice and overall entertaining reading.
