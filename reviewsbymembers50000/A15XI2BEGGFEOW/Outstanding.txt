 This was one of the first books I purchased when I began my journey of study into this art. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it. Saotome is one of the few individuals who actually studied with O-Sensei. He details several accounts of working with the founder both in and out of the dojo. He also gives a unique spiritual interpretation of many of the major techniques used in the art and references forces in nature and the universe for comparison. Well written and well founded. A must-read for any serious aikidoka.
