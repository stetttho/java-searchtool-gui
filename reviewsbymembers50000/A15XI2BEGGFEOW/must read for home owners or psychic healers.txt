 I am an experienced paranormal investigator. I have been doing a lot of heavy research into dowsing and geopathic issues in relation to paranormal phenomenon and can honestly say this book is the best thing I've read on geopathic issues ever. It's written in a very friendly, down to earth and concise manner. Roy and Ann share real-life lessons and experiences throughout the book with plenty of illustrations from their own work. Don't expect to learn the basics of dowsing or learn all the ins and outs of working with geopathic stress zones but do expect to get an outstanding overall perspective on dowsing for and correcting geopathic stress. There's even a chapter on discarnate entities (ghosts) and other spirits. I simply can't endorse this book enough. I'm making it required reading for my group!
