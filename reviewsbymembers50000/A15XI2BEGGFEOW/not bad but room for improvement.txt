 This book is required reading for newcomers to my paranormal investigation group because it gives a history of the spiritualist movement as well as basic information on most of the tools used in ghost hunting and paranormal investigation. However, the book does have some editing issues and doesn't have much in the  way of procedural information for conducting a credible investigation. To my experience there is not a "total package" book out on the market. I have not read it but I understand the Ghost Hunter's Bible has more procedural information but is littered with a lot of derogatory comments and unfounded opinions on alterative religions and the use of psychics in this line of work. While relying on psychics for proof is folly in any investigation as far as credibility we have found that they are indispensable. This is a great beginner book but don't expect it to give you all the answers.
