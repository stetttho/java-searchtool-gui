 A fascinating and compelling true story written by a registered nurse about a true haunting with a home her family purchased. This is on-par but not quite as good as Black Hope Horror. Given my experience in the field I can testify that the events covered in this book are very typical of true hauntings. One of the better haunting story books out on the market.
