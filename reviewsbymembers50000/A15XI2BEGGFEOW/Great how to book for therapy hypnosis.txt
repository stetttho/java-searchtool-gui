 An outstanding reference for novice and professional hypnotists alike. This book has the most up-to-date techniques on hypnosis and includes several methods of induction and some very practical scripts for conducting hypnotherapy sessions ranging from weight-loss to stopping smoking to dealing phobias and traumatic experiences. It even covers getting individuals to recall blocked memories or increasing the level of detail recalled in memories. This is written from a very professional clinical perspective.
