 This is one of the best books on dowsing I've read. The author gives you the theory and the practice side of things and covers all the basic dowsing tools and techniques. It's a short read but that doesn't mean it's short of information. It's not as complete or thorough as I would have liked in some areas but it's a GREAT book on the basic principles involved. To pick up where this book leaves off on geopathic and earth energy dowsing try the Healing Sick Houses book listed below. It's the perfect compliment.
