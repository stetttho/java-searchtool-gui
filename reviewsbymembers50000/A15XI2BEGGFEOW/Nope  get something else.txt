 Now, I enjoyed this book immensely though it is, in my opinion, quite feminist. I always strive for a balance and this appears to be a bit out of balance but if that's your thing you may dig this book.  On to the bad stuff... There's absolutely no historical data to back this book up. As near as I can tell it's a total lie. Wicca (or if you choose to disguise it as "Witta") is not 1000 years old. It's not even Celtic. It's barely 50 years old and wasn't founded with anything to do with Celts. See my website www.linesofthedragon.com
