 This was my first (probably last) time using ItsDeductible.  One rude surprise was that you can't export the data to TurboTax for the Web, which is what I'm using.  So after all that painstaking data entry into ID, I have to do it all over again in TTFTW.  I have sent a suggestion to Intuit, hopefully they'll get that fixed for next year.   This product would be more useful if it was purchased at the beginning of the year, and you stored all of your donations in it as you go.  Instead, I'm spending a half day transferring handwritten notes on receipts into the software... I'm thinking I will use a spreadsheet for that this year, and save the cost of this program.   Another beef is that there are numerous reports shown, but there are only really two!  Cheesy.  So, as a learning experience: keep digital photos of your donations, tie them to your data (a spreadsheet or this software), make reasonable estimates on the Fair Market Values, and you will be in good shape in case of an audit.  The government doesn't allow much in the way of deductions to the average tax payer, so take advantage of what you can!
