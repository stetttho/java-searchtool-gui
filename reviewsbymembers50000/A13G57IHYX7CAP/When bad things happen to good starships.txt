 After tearing through this book and staying up late last night to finish it, I have to disagree strongly with the professional review here.  This book was a knock out.  It was very easy to imagine these events occurring in our future.  The writing is definitely a fat notch above the usual sci fi fare.  Good writing, a great story, depth of characterization, and a lot to ponder...a five star book, in my book.  Unresolved issues?  Did the professional reviewer expect an answer to why God allows pain?  The theology here is not cut and dried.  Great science fiction takes a fundamental question and builds an interesting story around it.  And leaves the questions unanswered.  I wouldn't change a thing about this story, except maybe the Bishop.  He was a bit too shallow, undefined.  Maybe there was a reason for that, though.  Hmm.  I'll have to think about it.  Don't you think twice, though: buy this book!
