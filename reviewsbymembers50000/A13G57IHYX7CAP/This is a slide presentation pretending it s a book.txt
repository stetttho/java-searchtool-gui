 I have never seen anything like this before.  A slide presentation (with minimal notes) is all this is, folks. Very disappointing.  I wouldn't have minded if there had been some useful information, but I imagine that King supplies the "missing meat" when he gives his slide presentation.  As it stands, this book leaves me as in the dark as I began.  I was hoping for some illumination (puns intended) on the workings of the energy machine.  Perhaps the sparse notes included here are sufficient to an electrical engineer.  To a mere lay person, the book is opaque.  Too bad!  I hate to write a negative review like this, since I really do support the man's work and this type of research.  It's just unfortunate that this book does little to advance the cause of free energy research, in my opinion.  I'm returning it.
