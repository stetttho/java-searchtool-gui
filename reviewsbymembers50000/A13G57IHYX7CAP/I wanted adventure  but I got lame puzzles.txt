 At least in Riven (which I also grew tired of), there was a sense of "being there," of exploring a mysterious, beautifully detailed world.  I bought the CD version of Schizm, which was the only version for sale at Best Buy, dutifully loaded all 5 CD's, and was appalled at the low quality of the video. No sense of reality, no immersion. I KNEW I should've bought Myst 3, dang it.  But the truth is, the puzzles in this "game" are what I'd expect to find in a newstand puzzle magazine.  And I don't find those interesting, either.  I'm a programmer, and I live to solve logic problems.  So why don't I like Schizm? Because, based on the game's own description of itself, I was hoping that it would be more of an adventure, filled with discovery, wonder, and mystery.  As if you were truly stranded on an alien world and trying to figure things out.  The only game I've played like that is Thief II, which is WONDERFUL.  You interact, you figure things out, you knock a few guys out here and there with a blackjack, and meanwhile a great story develops, PAINLESSLY.  I can't wait for Thief III to come out... This game was nothing more than an interactive screensaver wrapped around some lame puzzles.  Very disappointing. This is the second Dreamcatcher title I've bought.  The other was Cydonia (now called Lightbringer, probably to throw people off the track who have read bad reviews of Cydonia).  Lesson learned: if it says Dreamcatcher, avoid it all costs.
