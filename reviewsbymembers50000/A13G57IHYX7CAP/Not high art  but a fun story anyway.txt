 This book may been more interesting and successful if had been given in-depth, serious nonfiction treatment.  I say that because the most interesting parts, for me, were the expository sections.  The fictional elements were shallow and amateurish, I thought.  Throwing in references to contemporary pop culture does not add to a novel's realism, it just cheapens it.  The "thriller" elements seemed to be hacked in as an afterthought, perhaps at the prodding of an editor looking to increase sales.  They certainly added nothing to the story. A third-person point of view would've made more sense.  As it is, the story is told by a scientist who tells his story in a rather dime-store fashion, all the while bemoaning the "dumbing down" of the Museum's exhibitions. The thoughts he shares with us reveal a guy who knows a lot of neat stuff, but is not a very interesting person to spend over 300 pages with. The actual story deserved to be given a much more serious treatment, by a more gifted writer.  I found Sawyer's attempt at down-to-earth, regular-guy banter to be insulting.  He assumes I am going to catch his references to Star Trek and Star Wars, and that that will make me like his main character.  Seems a cheap trick, to me.  The ramifications of First Contact with an alien culture, the realization that close-to-lightspeed travel is possible, the religious beliefs of the aliens, and even weightier matters, are not given realistic treatment.  I don't know...give me Molly Gloss or Gene Wolfe any day.  Good science fiction CAN be well-written and intelligent.  But this isn't it.
