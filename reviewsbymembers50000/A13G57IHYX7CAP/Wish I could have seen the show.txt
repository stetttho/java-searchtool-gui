 I've never seen such a frenetic editing job.  This was like Fillmore East meets Star Wars.  Or maybe Fillmore East meets MTV is more like it.  What, do they assume we all have a two-second attention span?  It would've been nice to see just ONE solo, start to finish.  Just one.  I got a headache watching this video.  I so wanted to see these guys play.  Instead, the view keeps jumping from one player to the other, almost like someone had the thing set on random.  Very very annoying.  But the performance was very tight, and worth suffering through the edit.  At times, it struck me that these guys seemed more like the world's best Allmans tribute band, rather than the real deal.  I have no problem with Dickey not being present, no problem at all.  His ego was always too overwhelming for me after Duane died.  No, my impression is based more on Derek Trucks's performance.  He seemed like some very intelligent rich kid who had spent his life learning every riff on Fillmore East, and had the advantage of help from Betts and others who had been there.  Very competent player, but completely lacking any soul.  This guy looked bored to tears half the time.  He never even broke a sweat.  Totally emotionless.  His playing was technically good, but...how shall I say this...  He plays like an upper middle class white kid.  You gotta suffer to play the blues, kid.  It ain't enough to just learn the licks.    Now, I know this is probably considered heresy by most of y'all reading this.  Oh well, it's just my opinion.  Good to see the boys playing some of the great classics, and playing them with the respect they deserve.  I just wish somebody would do another edit of this concert, and let us SEE the damn thing.
