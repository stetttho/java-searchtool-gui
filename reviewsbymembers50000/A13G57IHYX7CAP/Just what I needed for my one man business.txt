 This product has gotten a lot of bad press here on Amazon, apparently due to several years of buggy releases. I took a chance hoping that the recent flurry of patches had cleaned things up (v2 came out summer 2005, and by Feb 2006 is on R3). CM v2.03 seems quite stable to me, after two weeks of daily use. I've imported my QuickBooks and Outlook names without a hitch.  Since I use QB only occasionally, it's not a problem to have to start it up once in a while to sync with CM.  I don't find that a big deal.  You can create Groups, which is how you organize all your names.  Names can belong to multiple groups.  Go into the Names panel, select your group type, and only those names appear. So, despite a previous very negative review, it's a breeze to manage names.  I have over 2000 names in my db, and haven't had any issues.  This is not a replacement for a major-duty CRM product, by any stretch.  It fills a need for folks such as myself who need a way to organize our customer data.  Is it perfect?  Hardly.  I must fire off a product enhancement email at least once a day (Just click the "Help/Make a Suggestion..." drop down). There is also a thriving Intuit-sponsored user forum online.   For my purposes, this thing is great, and I just felt I had to add some positive energy to counterbalance the negativity. Now, when a customer calls, I quickly call up their data, and it's all there on my screen: what we discussed last, what projects I have for them, any related contact info, appointments... It's great.  They offer a 60 day refund, so it looks like they are trying to make a good faith effort at this point.  Too bad they brought it out not ready for prime time.  It looks ready now, and is only likely to get better.
