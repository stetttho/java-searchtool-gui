 What a disappointment this unit has been. We get the DVD player home, start watching a movie, and at about 1 and a half hours in, the movie freezes solid. The unit freezes up.  The controls don't respond.  You have to turn it off physically and restart it.  This happens with most DVD's, brand new, rented, it doesn't matter. So, we returned it, still under warranty, and got a replacement.  Guess what?  It does the same thing!  I spent hours trying to resolve this with Philips.  They sent me a "firmware upgrade," which should've corrected the problem.  Did it work?  Let me put it this way:  I still don't know how Three Kings ends.  Talk about frustrating.  What a total piece of junk.  Philips should be ashamed of themselves.  Please, whatever you do --- LOOK ELSEWHERE.
