 The first half of this book is a rather sarcastic, put-down-ish, trying-to-be-funny critique of the established paths to enlightenment.  I assume the author has given these methods a try, and none of them met his needs or expectations.  Apparently, he has found something, but I'll be darned if I can figure out what it was.  Perhaps it's impossible to put into words, this truth Mr. Harrison has found.  Perhaps I'm not capable of understanding what he's saying.  Maybe I'll read it another day, and the light will go on.   But I question his sarcastic attitude.  I suspect the author is embittered at his failures, and is working very hard to convince himself and others that he has succeeded.  The teachings of the Buddha have helped countless souls over the last two thousand years.  Mr. Harrison says this isn't so.  The emperor has no clothes, he says, but everyone's afraid to stand up and say "Hey! This meditation stuff doesn't work!"  What is he proposing in its place, though?  "Actuality".  Huh?  I don't get it.  I may get it some other day, but for now, my opinion is, this man is not helping anyone.   One final note:  the historical Buddha was a prince, a man who was brought up in very privileged circumstances.  Mr. Harrison is an Ivy League graduate.  The Buddha decided that all the prior teachings were wrong, and he set out to find out the truth for himself.  Mr. Harrison has done something similar.  Perhaps he has found the truth, perhaps not.  Perhaps he needs to try sitting under his personal bodhi tree just a bit longer, before dismissing Buddhism altogether.
