 Cinema 4D has a reputation as the world's best 3D package that no one has heard of.  But it is also known as one of the easiest to learn.  This is in large part due to the intelligent design of the interface.  C4D is at least as deep a product as Photoshop, however, and you are not going to learn how to use it by just clicking buttons.  You need a hands-on tutorial type of book.  Well, maybe you don't, but I sure do!  And this book is only one of two about C4D written in English.  (C4D is a German product.)  So I was relieved to find that this book is as helpful as it is.  Otherwise I'd need to learn German, and fast!  The book covers most of the basics quite well.  There is a project that continues throughout, which you work on more as you learn something new.  In addition, there are three (for some reason) tutorials on creating a human head.  This seemed a bit much, personally.  I would've liked to see more on textures and lighting.   I agree somewhat with others' comments that the tutorials can be vague.  And the screenshots, which look great on the CD-included PDF files (250 extra pages worth), look simply awful in the book.  They are small, low-contrast, grey, and sometimes impossible to make out.  This is the book publisher's fault, I'd guess, not the author's.  Luckily, the author has included every single screenshot on the CD.  Makes me think he was doing his best to make a bad situation better.  Charles River Media could learn a lot from Peachpit's Quickstart Guides.   If you are new to 3D and/or C4D, I'd highly recommend this book.  There is hardly any information available on the Internet about C4D...yet.  But my guess is, this product is going to leave its competitors in the dust.  Maxon has just released version 8, and it SMOKES.  I think this is a product worth learning, and this book is the place to start.  I hope Mr. Watkins does a revision for R8.
