 Doug Smith's music is very accessible, yet complex.  His playing is perfection, yet his technique is not in-your-face virtuosity.  Like Mozart and Bach, his tunes are the kind you can hum along with, yet they reward repeated listenings.  I enjoy Doug's music so much that I made the trek (pilgrimage?) to Portland just to take some lessons from him.  That's how much I think of this man's music.  So my advice to all lovers of acoustic guitar is: BUY EVERYTHING DOUG SMITH HAS RECORDED! Other top recommended CD's are Order of Magnitude and Alone Again.  If there were any justice in the world, Doug Smith would be a household name.
