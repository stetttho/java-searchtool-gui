 Ever since 9/11, I've been wondering what went wrong.  Obviously, we did something to really anger somebody.  Shows how naive I was, I guess.  I subscribed to a few American leftist magazines, hoping for an insight, but I have to say the answers I was looking for are all right here in this book.  Why did we attack Iraq?  Why were the World Trade Center and Pentagon (and nearby me here in Pennsylvania) attacked?  Who did it, and why?  Is it really just about oil?    Screeds by the likes of Michael Moore are funny and fun to read, but they don't answer the bigger questions.  We know Bushco is doing terrible things to our economy, the environment, he's working hard to roll back every inch of the New Deal...but what's he up to in Iraq?  The answer is in this book.    I'm very grateful to the author for publishing this insightful analysis.  Note, however, that when I ordered this book, Amazon told me it would be weeks before it shipped.  After a month went by, they said it would be a while, was I still interested?  At this point I cancelled the order, and ordered it from Amazon.ca (Canada).  It seems that, as of a few months ago, this book was VERY hard to come by in the US.  Published by a Canadian publishing house only, this book should be on everybody's reading list.  I don't know why it's not a bestseller, quite frankly.  But it is in the top 200.  Quite an achievement for a book that you can't order!    If you can get your hands on it, please read it.  It will clear up a lot of confusion and misinformation for you.  At least, it did for me.
