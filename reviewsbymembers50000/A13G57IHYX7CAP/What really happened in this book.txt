 I have a theory about this book.  Here goes:  the main character, Charlotte, is an author who has always wanted to write "real" fiction, on a par with her hero, Jules Verne.  Yet she only writes pulp fiction to support herself and her sons (no mean feat in itself).  This book is presented as a found manuscript, really a pile of writings tied up with a string.  And the finder, Charlotte's granddaughter, wonders if the events within really happened.  My guess is that they didn't "really" happen, and the manuscript is Charlotte's attempt at good, solid art.  One clue is the way the story is presented, as a there-and-back-again first-person story, very popular around the time the story takes place.  Obviously her notebook couldn't have survived her ordeals, and obviously she wouldn't have bothered to write as she did while trying to remain alive.  For me, this was the main reason I kept reading: to figure out if it was real or not.  I took special note of the interspersed "cuttings" included by Charlotte.  We see what I'm guessing is a first attempt at the same story we are reading (woman gets lost, is found by primitive beings, etc.).  We see newspaper clippings, perhaps collected by Charlotte while she was developing the idea for her story.  I see these as hints that the story is not really what happened to Charlotte.  At one point towards the end, she mentions that her own life was not worth writing about, despite how unusual she truly was.  I think she felt that she had to write a fantasy ala Verne or Conan Doyle.  That was the idiom she knew and respected, so it is the one she used.   Just my theory.  Read it and decide for yourself!
