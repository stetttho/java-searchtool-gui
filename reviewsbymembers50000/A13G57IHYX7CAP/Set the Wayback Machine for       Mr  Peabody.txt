 Has it really been nearly 30 years since I first heard this mythical album in a friend's bedroom, while incense burned and candles flickered...The amazing part is, it really is as good as I remember, though the sonic quality doesn't compare with today's acoustic recordings.  But still, thank goodness the suits finally got around to re-releasing this gem of a record.  Based on the success of "Blue Country Heart", no doubt, but hey, we'll take it whatever the financial reasons were.  Great fingerstyle blues and ragtime picking, and some beautiful ballads I had totally forgotten.  A real keeper.
