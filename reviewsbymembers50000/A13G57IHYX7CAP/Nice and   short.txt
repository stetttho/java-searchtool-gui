 I can only repeat what others have said here.  It's a nice CD, but it is shockingly short.  Especially after such a long hiatus between releases.  People said Sting was pretentious for releasing a 2-CD, "Nothing Like the Sun." However, Mr. Sting (?) at least gave us our money's worth.  At the end of the LP age, Sting released enough material to fill a CD, even if it meant the LP version would extend past the medium's capacity.  Now we have Enya releasing a recording only 34 minutes long, on a medium that can hold more than twice that. I'd call that a bit pretentious.  And not very respectful of her legions of fans.   And what is the deal with the Latin chanting stuff?  I never have understood that.   She could also do a little less of the pizzicato-sounding keyboard.  Gets tiresome.   But otherwise, I'm glad I bought it...
