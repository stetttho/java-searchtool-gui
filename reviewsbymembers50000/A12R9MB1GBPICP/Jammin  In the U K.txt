 Shakatak is one of the best jazz groups in the world.  With the rich, soulful sounds of each of the tracks, Shakatak has a way of bringing it all together.  "Shinin' On" is one of their best, although all of  them are great.  The track, "Paradise Island," will have you  groovin' no matter where you are.  The group has a fantastic way of  combining vocals at just the right times and with just the right songs.    As one of your most loyal fans, I say thank you, Shakatak, for the usual  "job well done!"
