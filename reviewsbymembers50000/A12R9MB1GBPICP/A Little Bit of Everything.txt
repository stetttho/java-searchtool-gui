 Strivers Row is a good, different story that encompasses a little bit of  everything--family, frendships, romance, academics and nostaglia for those  who want to return to those college days.  Grandmother Mary was something  else; she did somewhat redeem herself, but Aunt Phyl saved the day.   Strivers Row is about setting goals, working hard, realizing your dream and  reaching back to help others.  Add this delightful debut novel to your  reading collection.
