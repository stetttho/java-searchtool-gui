 The writer did an excellent job of capturing the essence and reality of what oftentimes happens in relationships.  She was extremely skillful in capturing it from an African American perspective.  However, the main theme  of the book transcends all racial lines.   Renee Swindle is a good  writer, and I believe that she will make her mark in the literary world as  more of her books are published.  I can't wait for her next novel.  Kudos!
