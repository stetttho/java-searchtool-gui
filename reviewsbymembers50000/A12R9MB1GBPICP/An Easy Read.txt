 The author is a good writer, and does a good job of capturing the black family and the trials and triumphs we all go through.  She did a very good job of showing readers the importance of family from a modern perspective.   This was an easy read, and it held my attention.  Also, the author was  particularly skillful in interjecting the strength of women (particularly  black women) in being able to handle multiple issues and adversities  simultaneously.  The author really shows the tremendous coping skills that  black women have and that black women have always had throughout our  history.  I highly recommend this book to fellow readers!
