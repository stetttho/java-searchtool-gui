 Silent Conspiracy is a must read for mystery lovers, but for all readers.  The characters are well developed, and the author did a superb job of developing the plot and story line to keep readers' interests.  I won't go  into the book's details so as not to give the story away, but I highly  recommend the book to all readers, not just mystery lovers.
