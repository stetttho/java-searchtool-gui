 Denise Turney successfully captured the past, present and future all in one book.  Her characters were well developed, and the story line was very touching.  The strength of Portia was unbelieveable.  She overcame a major  obstacle in her life through her faith in God, love for her family, and the  strength of her relationship with the man she loved.   Portia was about  family and the importance of maintaining close family ties.  Portia is a  story I won't forget!
