 This is a must read.  This book brings out so many issues that it's impossible to articulate them all in one review.  Michelle McGriff captures the emotions of family, friends and acquaintances all in one book.  Readers  will be quite surprised at what "Majestic Secret" really means.   The author did a great job in bringing it all together, with a happy  ending.  I only hope that readers will give it a shot.  It truly is a great  story.
