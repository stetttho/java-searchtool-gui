 Although this is the author's debut novel, it was written as though she is a seasoned author.  While I figured out what the deal was with Adrian early on, the events leading up to her true identity were captivating.  I kept  wondering if the author would actually have Greg catch Adrian in the act.   Well, he did, which was really the climax of the book.  I particularly  liked the way the author brought Greg around and allowed him to reconcile  with his mother.  The author was particulary skillful in showing how we can  oftentimes assume a lot of things that aren't necessarily the way we  assumed them to be, which was the case with Greg.  He assumed so many  things about his mother that turned out not to be the case at all.  The  author did an excellent job of progressing the novel in such a way that  didn't leave gaps or a disjointed feeling.  Camika Spencer is an excellent  writer.  Move over Terri McMillian and Bebe Moore Campbell.  Make room for  Camika Spencer!
