 Michelle McGriff has done it again.  She takes the real-life issue of sperm donors and weaves a story of love, conflict and intrigue.  Set in her native California, the story is an unusual romance novel that really touches the heart. When I write reviews, I try not to give the story away.  This is a book that can be read in a day, and that's a good thing.  It holds your attention, and you want to know what will the protagonist do?  How will she handle the dilemna she's faced with?  Will she make the "right" decision?   If you want to know the answers to these questions, get a copy of Michelle McGriff's new novel YESTERDAY.  You'll be glad you did.  Ms. McGriff is a romance novelist that steps beyond the boundaries of the traditional romance genre.  She adds twists and intrigue that will eventually propel her into the ranks of some of the great African American romance novelists such as Donna Hill, Frances Ray, Robin Amos and Shirley Hailstock. Looking forward to your next one, Michelle.
