 If you want to read a good book that's different and interesting, read Silent Conspiracy.  The author did a great job in developing the characters and holding the interests of the readers.  I won't disclose the plot or  story line because I don't want to give it away, but this is a must read.   It's different in that it's a mystery, and it keeps you in suspense.  I  highly recommend this book to all readers, especially those who are looking  for a different story.
