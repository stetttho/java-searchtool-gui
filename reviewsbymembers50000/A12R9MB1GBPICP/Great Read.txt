 This is a great debut novel.  Picking Up The Pieces has a little of everything: happiness, sadness, family, relationships, careers, you name it.  The author did an extrordinary job of developing the characters and  bringing it all together.  The end is shocking, which makes the book a  page-turner.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for  something to hold their interest.  I don't want to divulge too much about  the book and give it away, so I'll close by saying reders will be totally  shocked by its ending!
