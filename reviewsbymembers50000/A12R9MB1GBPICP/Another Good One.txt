 In typical Shakatak style, "Under Your Spell" is chock-full of tracks that will keep you jammin' from beginning to end. The first track, "Sunshine," sets the stage with an upbeat, soulful rhythmn that will have you up on your feet, moving to the beat. The remaining tracks are a combination of fast, slow songs that flow in the usual Shakatak arrangement. Shakatak has done it again. I have been a Shak fan for years since my college days. This CD reminds me of one of their earlier pieces, "Intuition," which rose to the charts and propelled the group into being one of the world's best contemporary jazz groups. I'm sue this CD will be another hit in their already successful musicial portfolio.
