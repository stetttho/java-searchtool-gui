 Father Found is an exquisitely woven story around the real-life social issue of child support and neglect.  Traveling through Chicago's dark side,  it is a story that we can all relate to at some point either directly or  indirectly.  Zale Rowen is a tough, hard-core guy on a mission, even though  that mission threatens his own life.  Martin and Debra Carter have their  own shocking secret--a secret that was unexpected, and one that is revealed  fairly early in the story. But there's more than that one issue for Martin  and Debra. There is action and drama  throughout the story, making it  hard to put down.  While out of town, I read it over the course of three  days and would have read it a lot faster if I not had to go to work.  The  story grabbed me from the first page.  Make this thrilling novel a part of  your reading collection.  You'll be glad you did.
