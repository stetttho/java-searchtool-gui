 This story is set during Robert Louis Stevenson's last days, as he attempts to continue writing while convalescing in Samoa.  One day an Edinburgh missionary arrives on the island where Stevenson lives.  He appears at chance moments to Stevenson and speaks in a manner both cryptic and threatening.  Soon a series of terrible crimes occurs on the island, and the natives are certain that Stevenson is responsible.  As a story based on the "double" or "doppelganger" theme, Manguel's book can be located in the literary neighborhood of Poe's "William Wilson," Chekhov's "The Black Monk," and Dostoyevsky's "The Double."  However, the story never does anything very unique to create an atmosphere of unease, nor does it travel deep enough into its characters or themes to rank with the best stories of this sort, such as Conrad's "The Secret Sharer" and "Heart of Darkness" or Gustav Meyrink's "The Golem" and "The Green Face"--let alone that masterwork of Stevenson's which Manguel obviously hopes to evoke, "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."  Perhaps it is the fact that this long story, or short-ish novella, is bound between hardcovers that one expects something of greater weight and significance.
