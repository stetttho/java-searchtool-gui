 Gifford's "Hotel Room Trilogy" contains the two incredible plays filmed by David Lynch for HBO and a third, lesser play.  The tangible mystery of these stories is grounded in peculiar relationships that unfold slowly before us, producing an unrelenting atmosphere of the uncanny.  In "Tricks" Gifford approaches the psychological territory of Kafka.  We meet two men looking for something more than just sex from a prostitute.  Are the men two halves of a severed personality?  "Mrs. Kashfi" is the story of Charlie, a young boy who must amuse himself in the apartment of a fortuneteller while his mother consults the woman.  This is the play that was not filmed, and though it is perhaps the least engaging work in the trilogy, the story does contain one unforgettable twist.  "Blackout" remains my favorite of the plays, and is a story I will cherish forever.  Danny and Diane, have come to New York in 1936 to meet a doctor, a specialist.  Diane has a mysterious problem that has shaken her sanity and dragged the couple through a crucible of grief, burning away everything but an intense, clear-eyed, and sincere love for each other.  In the end, "Blackout" is story rooted in a very basic relationship, and Gifford packs every line with texture and meaning-a style deeply reminiscent of Faulkner.
