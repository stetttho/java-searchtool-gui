 This band from Norway has a rare talent for enigmatic mood music; I tend to classify them with Jeff Buckley and with This Mortal Coil.  Velvet Belly has a light industrial sound, mixing synthesizer surprisingly well with  cello and violin.  In that sound there is something measured and spacious,  and it beautifully frames the irrepressible voice of Anne-Marie  Almedal.  The lyrics on 'Lucia' are startlingly fresh. Each song is a  sort of abstract sliver of feeling--an isolated moment in a relationship,  or an excerpt from a train of thought.  Each picture evoked is incomplete,  and the songwriters seem to understand that the best songs only begin a  process which is finished in the ear and mind of the audience.  The song  most likely to hook you on the first listen is 'Easy', a nicely layered  "problem" song. It shows just how distant this band keeps itself  from easy pop sentiment. The song is rather like Robert Frost's ironically  popular poem 'The Road Not Taken', in that it is probably saying the exact  opposite of what one first imagines.  Much could be said for every song  on 'Lucia', as each has such a distinct sound. 'Trick', though, is one that  keeps coming back at me, with its icy percussions and Almedal's penetrating  white-soul vocals. Also, the cover of Kate Bush's 'The Man With the Child  in His Eyes' is a very fine track, ending the album with loads of energy  and endless possibilities.
