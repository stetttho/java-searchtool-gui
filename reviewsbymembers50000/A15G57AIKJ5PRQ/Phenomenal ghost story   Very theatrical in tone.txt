 Sam Shepard, the writer/director of "Silent Tongue," is one of the big names in contemporary American theatre.  So it comes as no surprise that his two feature films--also, "Far North"--have a distinctly theatrical tone.  General audiences may not have a taste for this, but Shepard's films do reward additional viewings, and both have grown on me in a big way.  "Silent Tongue" is a ghost story which uncovers a disturbing sickness at the heart of the Old West.  River Phoenix becomes mentally unhinged when his Native American bride dies in childbirth.  This sends his father, Richard Harris, on a journey to try and find another woman for his son.  Exhibiting tragically limited imagination, the father returns to the traveling circus where he traded horses for the first woman, and he attempt a second bargain for the woman's sister.  In the end, the sister must confront the dead woman's ghost, and we learn the dark secret of their past.  Phoenix is eerily convincing as the mad Talbot Roe, and Richard Harris is uncharacteristic low-key as the world-weary Prescott Roe.  My only complaint is Dermot Mulroney who is miscast and unable to make his character's diction convincing.
