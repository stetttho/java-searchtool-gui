 'In ancient times, in the "time of inspiration", the poet flew from one world to another,  "riding on dragons".... They dragged  behind them long tails of dragonsmoke.... This  dragonsmoke means that a  leap has taken place in the poem.  In many ancient works  of art we notice  a long floating leap at the center of a work.  That leap can be  described  as a leap from the conscious to the unconscious and back again, a leap from   the known part of the mind to the unknown part and back to the  known.' So  begins one of the most fascinating books I have read in  the past several years.  Robert  Bly gives us his wonderful idea about  "leaping", surreal poetry and pays homage to the  modern masters  of this method, largely Spanish poets such as Neruda, Lorca and  Vallejo.   Involved in this idea are the concepts of Wild Association and the presence  of  three brains involved in a complex relationship within the human  mind. After  this book, you will never look at art, any art, the  same way again.
