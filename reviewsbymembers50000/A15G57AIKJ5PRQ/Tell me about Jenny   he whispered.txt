 Wilson (Terence Stamp) is an aging, but still surprisingly capable, British criminal just released from prison.  He travels from the UK to LA  and begins looking into his daughter's recent death with a gut feeling that  Jenny's car wreck was not an accident.  There Wilson meets Jenny's closest  friends and asks them all about her life in LA.  He soon targets Valentine  (Peter Fonda), Jenny's lover, as the obvious culprit.   	That's  the surface of the film, but there is another layer here that turned  standard thriller material into sublime art house fare.  "The Limey" is  very much a visual, cerebral film that moves in spirals and wanders through  a labyrinth of moods and lyrical images.  The film is finally all about  memories, and its climax is an epiphany of memory and of the strange  patterns that we fall into in our lives.   "The Limey" takes a  circuitous approach to the phenomenon of women falling for men like their  fathers and bringing their father-daughter baggage along with them.  What  trouble these relationships are the specific emotional patterns and games  people play, which are worked out in great detail between child and parent  very early in life.  So what happens when you bring all that to a  relationship with a new person who doesn't know the rules of your game,  doesn't know when you're bluffing or when you're making a serious threat?   Well, in a worst case scenario you might just end up dead.   And how  does it feel, as a parent, to recognize your own handiwork in your child's  homespun catastrophe?  "The Limey" answers that question with the force of  Greek tragedy, and the answer rings true. The film is a rare cinematic  accomplishment, achieving both an honest emotional foundation for Wilson's  dark epiphany and a web of rich, resonant images that anchor the entire  experience in a vivid, dazzling tapestry.
