 Anyone revealing sensitive plot material about this book is doing a great disservice to the reader and to the author's carefully constructive narrative; so let me say from the start that this review is "spoiler" free.   Kazuo Ishiguro has written what possibly will be remembered as the most readable, most important novel of 2005.  Like P.D. James' "The Children of Men" or Anthony Burgess' "The Wanting Seed," "Never Let Me Go" is a challenging work of speculative fiction that exposes the social absurdities and junk ethics of the hyper-industrial age.  It is also a profound work that questions what it is, in memory and in sentiment, that makes us human.  The novel's deceptively simple language and eminently accessible narrative voice neatly hide the workings of what is in fact a most complex, innovative novel.  Take for instance Ishiguro's twist on the "speculative fiction" format.  Instead of placing the story in the near future, he has placed it in the near past--thus refusing the reader the small comfort of distancing himself from the story's implications by means of the "near future" buffer.  Ishiguro seems to be warning that the seeds of wrong, in this eerie cautionary tale, are present already in our history and our society as they are; only a few minor hurdles of technology and modern, degenerative philosophy remain to be surmounted.  For anyone who has finished this book and would like to see its themes developed further in a couple of non-fiction books, I can recommend C.S. Lewis' "The Abolition of Man" and Wendell Berry's "Life Is a Miracle : An Essay Against Modern Superstition."
