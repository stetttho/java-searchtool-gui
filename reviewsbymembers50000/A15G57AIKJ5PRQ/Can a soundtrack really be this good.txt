 Well, yes.  This is simply the ultimate in surreal mood music. Lynch and Baladamenti will float you away on a bluesy wave of melancholy.  The third song on the album has Jimmy Scott singing "The Sycamore Trees" -- a special import to this soundtrack from Twin Peaks' last episode.  "A Real Indication" has Badalamenti himself supplying the lyrical equivalent of an out-of-the-body experience.  Then Julie Cruise makes an appearance with "Questions In A World of Blue," Laura Palmer's tragic goodbye.  Then the album moves into a brief but terrifying trip through hell with "The Pink Room" and "The Black Dog Runs at Night."  And finally the whole dizzying ride levels out with some of that good old Twin Peaks slowdance, music for sweet dreams.
