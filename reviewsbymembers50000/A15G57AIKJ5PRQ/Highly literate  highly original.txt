 This neo-pagan novel is a psycho-spiritual portrait of one English town told in a dozen first-person snapshots over a period of 6,000 years, beginning with the story of a Neolithic man and ending with a mystical, poetic monologue in the author's own mind in the Northampton of 1995.  Northampton is examined as a phenomenological entity with Moore attending as occult detective, a shaman mapping its mental geography.  Brilliant, disturbing, overwhelming and highly original.
