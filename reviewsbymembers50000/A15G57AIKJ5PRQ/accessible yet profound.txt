 This wonderful little book is eminently accessible yet also manages to be quite profound.  Mathewes-Green has several important things to say to Christians unfamiliar with the Eastern Orthodox tradition and relates many excellent thoughts about the difference, in basic points of theology, between the early church and modern, western Christianity.  For western Christians, Mathewes-Green offers a startlingly fresh perspective on issues such as the transformative act of conversion, authority within the church, the meaning of repentance and forgiveness, and the purpose of prayer.  The chapter on "The Jesus Prayer" is reason enough for reading the book.  The later chapters, "Dealing with Others : The Smaller Circle" and "Dealing with Others : The Larger Circle" make for important and humbling reading and could be taken together, for great benefit, with C.S. Lewis' sermon "The Weight of Glory"; however, the second of these chapters should be read and carefully weighed in balance with I Corinthians 5--an often neglected passage dealing with the ideas of "judgment" and of forgiveness within the church.
