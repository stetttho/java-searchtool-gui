 Jack (played by Kevin Anderson) is released from prison and meets up with Ainsley, a young woman he has been writing letters to for quite some time.  Ainsley (Martha Plimpton) is a sweet romantic simpleton who doesn't even want to know about the crime that put him in prison.  Jack believes that he has been reformed by the justice system and by religion, but he's also a control freak.  For strange reasons lost in the mysteries of the human heart, these poor souls decide to start a relationship. One can't give away too much of the plot without collapsing the nonlineary framework of the film and ruining its breathtaking effect.  So suffice it to say that this recipe for disaster is tossed up in the air along with the biblical story of God asking Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac and with all the theological and ethical problems both of these stories present.  Everything builds to whirling climax of nonlinear convergence and small-scale horror.  In the end the audience is brought face to face with that grand philosophical theme "the problem of evil," and we find no easy solutions.
