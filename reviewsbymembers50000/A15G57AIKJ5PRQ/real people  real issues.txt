 "Human Resources" is an excellent docudrama about labor issues in France following the instatement of the 35-hour work week (a measure taken to help remedy the country's unemployment crisis).  The film has a wonderfully realistic tone and authentic characters coping with the challenges of everyday life in the modern world.  Director Laurent Cantent (of the superb "Time Out") has given us as substantive a look at public issues working themselves out in individual lives as we saw in Soderbergh's "Erin Brockovich" or Sayles' "Matewan."
