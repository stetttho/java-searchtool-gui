 Donald Margulies' "Dinner with Friends" received the 2000 Pulitzer Prize in Drama, a well-deserved award.  The play deals with two couples who have been close for a long time, but now one couple is going through a divorce.  Throughout the play, relationships are questioned and reorganized.  The still-married couple find themselves assessing the strength of their own relationship and mourning the little corner of their world which dies when their friends divorce.   "Dinner with Friends" is a rare gem--a questing, moral play that takes an honest look at the issues of commitment and fidelity in today's world.  I don't think I've seen a new play which delved so deep and true into the heart of an everyday issue, and with everyday characters, since David Mamet's "Oleanna."  The last two scenes bare the relationships and souls of the characters so fully (and, thankfully, without overt hysterics) that I literally got the chills.   In scene three of the second act Gabe meets his friend Tom a few months after Tom and his wife have split.  Tom is living with his travel agent girlfriend, and Gabe quickly tires of Tom's rationalizations and his descriptions of the fantasy life he has constructed around himself.  Tom talks fanatically about his newfound freedom, and Gabe tells him he's starting to sound "like a Moonie."  Gabe finally voices the essential problem he has with Tom's decision to leave his family.  Gabe says, "The key to civilization, I think, is fighting the impulse to chuck it all."  Then Tom tries to tell Gabe that maybe Gabe's own marriage isn't all that it appears to be; Tom has heard Gabe complain in the past, and Tom says that he knows the signs of trouble.  The difference between the two men, however, is that Gabe believes in working at his marriage and cannot imagine ever giving up.  "You don't get it," Gabe says.  "I _cling_ to Karen; I _cling_ to her.  Imagining a life without her doesn't excite me, it just makes me anxious."
