 It?s the scintillating story of a man with a dream--a dream to never let truth interfere with his cynical fantasies and to prove that the end always justifies the means, at least for an incurable narcissist!  Any 5-page section of this book is enough to blow Moore?s cover as the modern world?s most diabolically clever propagandist.  Take, say, pages 21-25 in which the authors detail Harlan Jacobson?s (then editor of ?Film Comment? magazine) 1989 expose of Moore?s film ?Roger & Me,? in which he reveals that nearly every event that Moore portrayed as ?fallout? from the 1986 GM layoffs in Flint, MI (remember all those inept attempts by the city to revitalize its economy?) were--gasp! surprise!--actually events that took place before 1986 and had nothing to do with the layoffs; all these events that Moore shows after the layoffs actually occurred in 1980-1985.  (Pauline Kael also wrote a damning review of the film for the ?New Yorker,? and her piece was considered the reason ?Roger & Me? did no business at the Oscars that year.)  Or take just the 3-page section, pages 178-180, in which the authors duplicate exactly Moore?s own conspiracy-theory methods to show the connection between Moore himself (via Miramax, Disney, & the Carlyle Group) to the bin Laden family!  Brilliant stuff.  It?s the most entertaining read I?ve had in months!
