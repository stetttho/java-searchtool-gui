 This is an indispensable book for anyone beginning their studies in Jungian psychology.  At 140 pages in length, the text is an easy read with no wasted words and no convoluted passages to unravel.  It addresses Jung's  entire system and provides succinct, memorable summaries of each  concept. The Book is broken up into seven chapters: 1. Carl  Gustav Jung (biographical background) 2. The Structure of Personality  (the psyche, conscious, personal unconscious and collective  unconscious) 3. The Dynamics of Personality (psychic energy and values,  the principles of equivalence and entropy, etc.) 4. The Development of  Personality (individuation, transcendence and integration, etc.) 5.  Psychological Types (thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuitive) 6.  Symbols and Dreams 7. Jung's Place in Psychology. For more  eminently readable Jungian psychology, try Marie-Louise von Franz.
