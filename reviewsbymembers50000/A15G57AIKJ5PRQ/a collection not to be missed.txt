 In January 2004, the Pacific Northwest lost one of its distinctive literary voices with the death of Jack Cady.  This, his last book, is a wonderful tribute to that cult genre he loved so much, the ghost story.   Written in Cady's irresistible, gregarious, ear-bending storyteller's style, each piece is something unique and surprising.  "The Lady With the Blind Dog," though full of distinctive Cady elements, reads like the sort of modern mytho-fantasy so prominent in the writing of Neil Gaiman.  "Daddy Dearest" is one of the more successful renditions of the "humorous ghost story" that I've come across, succeeding as it does by substituting fright with Twain-like, tall-tale audacity.  The collection's 80-page novella, "The Time that Time Forgot"--though marred somewhat by anti-war moralizing--is a thick, atmospheric, mystical adventure.  And "The Ghost of Dive Bomber Hill," I am certain, will prove to be one of the great, enduring American ghost stories, a tale ranking near the work of that master ghostly author Russell Kirk. In addition, the book includes two wonderfully engaging essays, one on the ghost story and the other on religion in science fiction.
