 Kazuo Ishiguro's "A Pale View of Hills," his first novel, is a devastating, breathtaking work of structural genius.  Hence, it is a story that you have to pay extremely close attention to if you want to work out the mystery at its heart, and once you finish you'll likely want to read it a second time.  Ishiguro has long been considered one of the great contemporary practitioners of the "unreliable narrator" technique.  His narrator here is Etsuko, an older Japanese woman who has, many years before, immigrated to Britain.  Through the course of the novel she reminisces about her time as a young wife and mother-to-be in post-WWII Hiroshima.  On the surface Etsuko is the ideal traditional, timid, submissive Japanese wife.  But pay close attention to everything she says--she's a monstrous liar, and not until the very end do all the puzzle pieces she's been trying to keep hidden suddenly come crashing in on you.
