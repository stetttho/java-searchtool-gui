 This is minimalist filmed version of a play originally directed for the stage by Judi Dench.  In my opinion, it's also Kenneth Branagh's finest screen performance.  For a full two hours, he is Jimmy Porter, the man you  want to hate but can't help but love.  He's one of the educated lower  class, burdened by ego and unfulfilled potential.  He's an urban lion with  a huge heart and claws that constantly torture those around him, namely his  wife (Emma Thompson).  These characters are so real, you'll dream about  them afterward, and if you give it a chance, this film will work its way  into your heart and teach you something about life.
