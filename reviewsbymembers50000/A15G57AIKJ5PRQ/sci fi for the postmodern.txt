 In this Serbian, postmodern, science fiction novel (yeah, you read that right) a mysterious stranger appears in three different times to three different people.  He talks to them each about certain aspects of the nature of time and then gives each a "time gift," a visit to another time which will have special significance for him or her.  In the book's fourth and final section, the mystery of the stranger and his visits is solved in the most unexpected way while questions of time-theory give way to a unique aesthetic statement.  Not too much can be said about the organizing concept or the ending of this book without ruining its effect on the reader.  Like most postmodern writers, Zivkovic depends heavily on the surprise created by the way he unexpectedly warps the traditional structure of a narrative.  Postmodern writers generally violate at least one of the big, assumed "laws" of storytelling (good pop culture examples of this are the films of Charlie Kaufman--"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," etc.).  This is not to say that Zivkovic's work is a hollow stylistic exercise, however.  The final section of "Time Gifts" offers the reader one or two truly substantive problems to ponder over.  Zivkovic's prose, also, is often a treat.  As an example, here is a priceless image from the novel, which comes as Zivkovic describes the modest amenities in the office belonging to an aging academic, a woman addicted to tea: "Several used tea bags were lying on the newspaper like tropical fish that had died of asphyxiation."  A precious little gem, that.
