 "Are All the Giants Dead?" is a very fun story peppered with clever in-jokes for those who love fairy tales. Young James, who is more interested in science fiction than fairy tales, is wisked away in his sleep by Mildred, an ethereal storyteller who takes him off to a magical kingdom.   This place turns out to be the land of "happily ever after"  where all the legendary heroes and heroines of the past live in leisure and  contentment long after their stories have ended.  James, though, finds one  or two stories left unresolved, and so his adventure begins. Mary  Norton's prose is crisp and well paced, and her characters are very well  drawn.  The story, however, may have turned out more memorable had the plot  become a bit more involved.  The villian of the story, for instance, is  glimpsed only briefly at the tale's end. And of course Brian Froud's  8-10 black and white illustrations are fantastic.
