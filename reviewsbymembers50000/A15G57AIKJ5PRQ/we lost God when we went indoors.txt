 In this short polemic work of 133 pages, Dale Allison makes a strong argument that the secularization of the modern West is not due to philosophical proofs against religion or a large-scale, reasoned enlightenment among the populace.  Rather, this secularization is due largely to a basic change in environment, resulting from the Industrial Revolution.  The environmental factors that once engendered a religious sensitivity--long periods of silence and darkness (that is, periods of sensory relaxation) and direct, regular contact with nature--have been replaced in the modern world with constant sensory stimulation and insular, artificial environments.  Allison promotes all of the following as an antidote to this modern trouble: cultivation of silence and darkness, contact with nature, a return to traditional physical postures in prayer, meditation on the deeds of saints and heroes, and development of the "ascetic imagination."  His antidote culminates in the last of these prescriptions, and Allison gives this brief three-part program for "fortifying" the ascetic imagination: "(1) extended reflection upon transcendent realities, (2) prolonged experience of the natural world, and (3) stillness without and within."  "The Silence of Angels" makes many wonderful points with many quotations from Christian and non-Christian sources alike.  However, my one reservation is that the book, as brief as it is, might have been strengthened by some editing in the chapters at its center.  Allison occasionally belabors his points, assembles more examples than necessary, and lets his argument dwell on small points for too long--thus breaking its momentum.  All in all, though, this is a fine book worthy to be placed in the company of C.S. Lewis' "The Abolition of Man," Wendell Berry's "Life Is a Miracle," and Michael Aeschliman's "The Restitution of Man."
