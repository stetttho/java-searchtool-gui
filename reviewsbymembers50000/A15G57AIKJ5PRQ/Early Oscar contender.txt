 By far the best film I have seen this year.  Sure, there's been some flashy fun stuff like The Matrix and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.  And there's been some more subtle art-houst films like Run Lola Run and The  Winslow Boy.  But Cookie's Fortune has it all: rich plot, a dozen  beautifully written and acted characters, and a climax to die for.  And:  It's the best thing Altman's done since Short Cuts!
