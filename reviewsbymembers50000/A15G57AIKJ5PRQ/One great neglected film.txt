 3 Weddings and a Funeral...  'Once Around' is a film all about ceremony--about ritual, tradition and family.  Sam (Richard Dreyfuss) is a rich older man falling for the younger Renata (Holly Hunter) while her  family looks on, not sure what to make of Whirlwind Sam.  Is Sam simply a  superficial, living-for-the-moment egotist?  Or is he a rare, and easily  misunderstood, creature of guileless passion as Renata believes?   Superb, subtle cinematography and perfect casting.  Hunter and Dreyfuss  are the name stars, but Gena Rowlands is every bit as good.  And one could  say that Danny Aiello's actually makes this 'his' film.  Another gem  from Lasse Hallstrom, master of the honest sentimental film.  'Once Around'  hits the heart and rings true, and it's a thousand miles away from sappy.
