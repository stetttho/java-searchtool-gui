 Novelist, poet and conservationist Wendell Berry takes recent scientific innovations such as genetic cloning as his starting point for arguing against the reductive modern view of life fostered by scientism. Berry then proposes a more cautious, more humble worldview in which life is seen as a mystery and a miracle, as something we will never be able to fully control or even understand. He argues that cultural beacons in art, philosophy, and metaphysics should be consulted if we hope to rescue our educational, religious, and artistic communities from their crumbling foundations which have been built on smug rationalism and aggressive materialism.
