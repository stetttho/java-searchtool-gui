 This film, of course, is a 5-Star film, but the DVD gets just 4 due to the inept layer change.  It comes directly after a key line of dialogue.  Just as Chris Cooper's character is having an epiphany, the sound disappears and  the image freezes momentarily as the layers change.  Ugly, clumsy: Studios  get a clue.  Grrr... Putting that aside (and the fact that there are no  real DVD 'extras') it's great to finally see the film in widescreen again.    This is one of Sayles' best, up there with The Secret of Roan Inish and  his neglected masterpiece, City of Hope.
