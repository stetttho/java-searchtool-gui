 Dream Harder is a transition for Mike Scott and The Waterboys, a move beyond their heavy celtic phase and into something sounding a little more like pop.  The hit single, The Glastonbury Song, is the heart of the album.  Bursting with creativity and imagination, the song can only look forward.  The New Life in a Spiritual City is clearly in sight here for The Waterboys.  Their creative influences come to them in visions, and the "boys" introduce us to C.S. Lewis, Jimi Hendrix, and the pagan god Pan.  Their music soars and, as always, the lyrics are poetry.
