 Wonderful blend of real-time and stop-motion storytelling by a master of the surreal.   An apparently ordinary everyman is led by curiousity into a dilapidated building which  turns out to be a strange cross of theatre, a  puppeteer's workshop, and an alchemical  laboratory.  Suddenly, he finds  himself becoming the legendary character Dr. Faust,  selling his soul to  the devil to gain magical powers.  Jan Svankmajer is the real sorcerer  here and blends stage sets with real settings,  seven foot puppets with  live actors, and makes magic of it all.  The film has been dubbed for  English audiences, but I have never seen a less  obtrusive film dub.  The  voice performances are excellent and actually add to the  surreal quality  of the film.  Just one caution: This is not a "family" film.   There is some adult material, so don't  confuse this with Bass and Rankin  style claymation.
