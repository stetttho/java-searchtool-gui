 A beautiful, subtle film.  One of the year's best. A shock, a surprise, a revelation--David Mamet's idiosyncratic style is a perfect match for the era.  The story and performances are nearly flawless, and the ending scene  is a masterpiece of careful emotion--I can only compare it to certain  scenes in 'Remains of the Day.'
