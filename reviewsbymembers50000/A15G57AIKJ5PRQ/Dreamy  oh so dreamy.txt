 After the popularity of the Twin Peaks soundtrack, David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti                         collaborated with Julee Cruise to  produce this fantastic album. Includes songs from Twin                          Peaks and Blue Velvet.                         Lynch's lyrics come  straight from the dark side of the brain, as does Angelo's music. And                          Julee's voice floats it all right up to radiator heaven.
