 . . . you still have to buy the CD!  The full Ashley experience can only be had live, but this is the next best thing.  When he revs his fiddle up to a fevered pitch, just imagine a whole lot of stompin' going on.  Mr. MacIsaac learnt his fiddle playin' from the King of the Faeries, and the energy in this album proves it!  Here you have the hit single, "Sleepy Maggie," sung in Galic but all about "sex and dancin'."  And there's "The Devil in the Kitchen," a no holds barred, take no prisoners, gritty, grungy Fiddle Fest.  In the middle of the album, the humor of "What An Idiot He Is" sneaks up on you; it's one of the funniest, wittiest songs I've ever heard.  Point is: the album's all good. You've moshed, you've banged your head.  Now learn how to stomp.
