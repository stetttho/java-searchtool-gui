 I've had 2 other tape rewinders in the past, and both of them sounded awful, clacking and whirring away like they were shredding my tapes.  Also, the lids often popped up before the rewinding was finished.  This one,  though, just has a pleasant, gentle little hum and does what it's supposed  to.  It's nice to see that a company actually put some effort into this  invaluable but mundane necessity of every VCR owner.  And the price is  right too!
