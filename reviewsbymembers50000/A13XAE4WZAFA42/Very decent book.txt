 The book consists of 5 parts, appendices (the 6th part) and covers the following topics: 1. Introduction to Linux environment and basic development tools (gcc and make). 2. System programming (processes,  signals, system calls, file handling and daemons).  3. Some Linux APIs  (Berkeley database, ncurses, sound API) and creating your own  libraries. 4. Interprocess communication (pipes, shared memory,  semaphores and sockets). 5. Programming utilities (RCS, gdb, RPM and  other packaging). Everything is done using C. All explanations are clear  and concise, and are illustrated by the sample project. Appendices contain  lots of useful Internet links by categories. The book looks very good but  in my opinion it could be even better if the author used C++ instead of C.  Writing UI with ncurses is a bit obsolete, but the author has promised to  write about Xwindow and OpenGL in his next book. We'll see. SUMMARY: in  my opinion if you have at least a moderate Unix/Linux experience you won't  learn too much from this book. But if you know a little about Unix/Linux  programming (and have a working knowledge of C) you will probably love it.
