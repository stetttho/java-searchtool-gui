 I used this book to prepare for exam that I successfully passed. My overall impression from the book is very positive. It is well-structured; all explanations are clear and concise. It is strongly focused at exam and doesn't spend your time on irrelevant topics. I think it covers not less than 90% of what you need for exam. I recommend reading it along with enquiring Books Online. However it has noticeable amount of typos. Most of them are quite obvious, but I can recall at least a couple of typos that really made me confused. The companion CD is much worse. I expected the tests from CD to be a real help, but their format made them very inconvenient to use. Moreover, some test questions seemed to be corrupted. Honestly I think the CD is nearly useless. SUMMARY: this book is not ideal; however it can be certainly used to prepare for the exam.
