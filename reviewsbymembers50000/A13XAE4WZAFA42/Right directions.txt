 Today I passed the exam and this book was my main instrument during preparation. The book gives right directions and touches all the topics that you may encounter on exam. No unnecessary topics, and no topics  missed. It is of a comparatively moderate volume and allows to focus on  exam preparation. Of course, nothing is ideal in this world, this book  isn't too. Not everything is covered with a depth necessary for exam.  Sample test in the book is noticeably easier than a real exam. I also  noticed some minor errors. BTW, it was my 8th MS exam (previous were 4  MCSE core exams, TCP/IP, IIS 4, Proxy 2) and I found it the most difficult.  Before reading this book, I had read Special Edition Using SQL 7 (QUE) and  played with MS SQL 7 for a couple of months (but I had an experience with  other DBMS). SUMMARY: I recommend this book for the exam preparation but  I don't recommend to rely on it as the only source of information, use at  least SQL Books Online as a supplement, and of course play with SQL Server,  trying and checking all unclear moments on a test database.
