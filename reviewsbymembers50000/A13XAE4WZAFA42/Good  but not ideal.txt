 Like  all other books from this series ("Special Edition. Using...") which I have seen, this book covers a wide range of material on the subject but is a bit shallow. Nevertheless it is useful for both database administrators  and developers. The explanation is quite clear and comprehensive, though I  think sometimes more examples would be helpful. The author obviously  assumes that readers already have some experience with databases, most  probably with previous versions of MS SQL server.  If you don't have any  database experience at all (not necessarily with MS SQL) you may have  problems because the author doesn't explain in details the general  principles of relational databases but just shows how they are implemented  in MS SQL 7.0. In my opinion if you are not scared by what I said above  you will find this book useful.
