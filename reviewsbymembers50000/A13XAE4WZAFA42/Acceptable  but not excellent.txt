 Probably I would give it 3 stars and a quarter, or even one third, but obviously less than 4 stars. The authors tried to cover nearly all the topics in linux programming (excluding databases). The results are quite  mixed. The most of explanation is done using C, though C++ is also touched  a couple of times. The book consists of 6 parts. Part 1 is the linux  programming toolkit. Not bad at all. Suprising things are that gdb is  described in part 5, and electric fence in part 2, not here. Part 2 -  System programming, Part 3 - Interprocess communication and networking.  These parts are central and most valuable in the book. Good. Though I like  Linux Application Development by M.K.Johnson and E.W.Troan better. Part 4  - Programming the user interface. Very shallow. You can learn that such and  such techniques exist but may hardly understand how to use them. Part 5 -  Special programming techniques. A strange feeling. As if the authors  decided to collect here the material which they did'nt know where else to  place. Part 6 - Finishing touches (about creating the software packages  and documentation). Not bad at all, though a little shallow again. As it  was already said in the previous reviews there are regular references to  the non-existing CD. RESUME: it is an acceptable book, espesially if you  just start programming linux, or migrate from another platform. You will  get acquainted quickly with the most necessary things. So if you have  bought it, try to enjoy it:). If you don't have it yet I recommend better  to buy already mentioned Linux Application Development for both application  and system programmers, plus Programming with Qt by M.Dalheimer or  Developing Linux Application by E.Harlow if you are interested in GUI  development for KDE or GNOME respectively.
