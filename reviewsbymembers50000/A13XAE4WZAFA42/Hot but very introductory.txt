 This small book (just 200 pp.) will help you understand what is this new C# about in a very quick and easy way. The main advantages of the book are its brevity (in a good sense), ease to read, and of course its availability. Its drawbacks are direct results of advantages: the book gives only an introductory description of the language itself and lacks many important related details and topics. E.g. standard .NET classes are not covered, interoperability with the old COM is only touched, etc. I think the ideal reader for this book is a C++ guy with some COM experience. The author claims that if you are a VB guy it?s also OK, but I can?t neither confirm nor deny it. It is obvious that next year we?ll have lots of deeper (I hope) books on C# and .NET, but if you wish to learn more about it right now this book is not bad at all.
