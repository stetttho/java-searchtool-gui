 The book provides a detailed guide to developing OLE DB consumers using ATL. Unlike other books it goes much further than just showing you how to build a primitive consumer using ATL wizard. The author explains how to use OLE DB templates to develop real world applications, e.g. with various types of accessors, accessing not only regular tabular data sources but also OLAP and hierarchical data, etc. A very good on-line support for the book provides some useful template extensions as well other additional information. Unfortunately the book doesn't touch OLE DB providers but at least it's clearly stated in the title. Very recommended!
