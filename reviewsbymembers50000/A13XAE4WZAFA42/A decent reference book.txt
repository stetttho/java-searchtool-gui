 As far as I know it's the only FreeBSD book but  it would deserve 4 stars even in a tough competition. It covers installation, networking and administration in all details. I also enjoy FreeBSD 3.3 on 4 CDs enclosed  in the book. I think the book lacks the description of coexistense with  other operating systems (Samba coverage is shallow) and modern GUI desktop  like KDE (I found it different in some details from Linux). It should also  be more up-to-date.
