 One third of the book describes how to use RPM while the rest is about developing your own RPM packages. The book is quite comprehensive, well-organized, can be used both as a guide and a reference.  The book  was written 3 years ago, so it already is becoming obsolete and incomplete,  but it's the only one on the subject and still is a good starting  point. I don't see much sense to buy this book unless you are a developer  preparing your own installations. Any decent Linux guide contains  information on the most useful RPM commands, which is sufficient for  regular users. But if you really need to know the RPM underhood and digging  into the soulless man pages doesn't make you ecstatic you have to buy this  book.
