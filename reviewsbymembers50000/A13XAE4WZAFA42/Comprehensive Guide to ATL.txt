 The book consists of 4 parts: 1.Building ATL COM Clients and Servers (a brief introduction in COM theory and ATL). 2.Implementing COM Techniques in ATL. 3.Windowing and ActiveX Controls in ATL. 4.Developing ATL-based  Database Applications. This book gives an extremely brief explanation of  COM technique and is focused on how ATL facilitates and dramatically  increases speed of implementing COM. All explanations are quite clear and  comprehensive (if only a book on COM and ATL can be comprehensive). Some  minor inaccuracies don't spoil the whole impression. I recommend this book  to anyone interested in learning ATL.  About its prerequisites. Mr. Bates  claims that of course you should have experience of C++ programming in a  Windows environment, but that you don't need to have any experience of  COM/DCOM. In my opinion, to get the most of the book you should at least  have already read Inside COM by Dale Rogerson. Even better if you read  Essential COM by Don Box as the second book, and only then this book. In  any case starting this book as the first COM reading would be too hard.
