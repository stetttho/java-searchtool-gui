 I used this book during my preparation and found it veryuseful. It provides a brief summary on all topics you need to know topass the exam.   The book uses a usual Exam Cram format, i.e. each chapter is finished with sample questions and a list of additional information sources (Internet, MSDN, etc.), so if you don't feel confident you know where to find more. The last chapter is a sample test. The questions are very similar to the actual exam. However I strongly recommend trying the electronic simulation after reading the book, because the format of the real 70-100 exam is very different from any other Microsoft exam.  Otherwise, on exam you may spend your precious time not analyzing the case studies, but mastering the user interface of the test. Another big advantage of the book is that covering all exam objectives it has a comparatively small volume, just about 300 pp, of which at least 50 pp. are questions and answers,  I don't give it 5 stars only because I found a couple of minor inaccuracies in the book. REMARK: I agree in many aspects with what Dr. Robert C.A. Goff, MCSD said below in his review, especially what he wrote about relation to 70-029 exam (I did the same way). What I don't accept is the necessity to pay extra money for Transcender practice exam. In my opinion using a simple demo simulation from Microsoft site will let you get familiar with the format exam and it's enough. At least it worked for me.
