 The book consists of 2 parts. The 1st part is a detailed guide to the real-time POSIX programming. The 2nd part presents a reference to all POSIX real-time functions. The book also has an appendix with various sample and exercise code. All explanations in the first part are very clear and complete. Writing style resembles the best programming books (like those from K&R or R.Stevens). At the same time everything is given in a distilled manner without unnecessary water, so that you might handle the stuff surprisingly fast.  The second part is less valuable since all this material can be found in UNIX man. But if to see it as just a free bonus for the 1st part it is not bad at all. In any case having printed manuals is quite useful. Sample code in the appendix is also interesting to look at. Actually I didn't notice any considerable drawbacks in the book and recommend it to everyone interested in the subject. The prerequisites are minimal. You should know C and be familiar with the basic UNIX/POSIX API (like working with files, etc.). The next reading is obvious - some book on POSIX threads (I'd recommend one by Mr. Butenhof).
