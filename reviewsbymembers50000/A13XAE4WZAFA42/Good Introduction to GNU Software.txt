 The book collects the information usually scattered in different places.It covers the following tools: gcc, emacs, gdb, make, rcs, gprof. The explanation is pretty clear, necessary examples are given. What I don't  like in this book: too many words about benefits of free software, probably  more technical topics and details would be more useful. E.g. the chapter  about 'make' even doesn't mention pattern rules. I'd like also to see a  section devoted to CVS. The level of details is good for an introductory  course but is not sufficient for a reference book. RESUME: if you are new  to GNU tools and going to use them on a regular basis this book will help  you, otherwise skip it.
