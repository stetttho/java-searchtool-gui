 Steeped in espionage and counter-intelligence, Snaden and Dow's book, Betrayed, builds intrigue and suspense through refreshing eloquence and descriptive simplicity. The tapping of subconscious levels of recognition evident in things such as PTL Computers and an underlying humor - when I read about someone sitting in front of a monitor, his frog face reflecting the green screen- I laughed. I could really see it, and saw too, the genius of this writing team.  With honest portrayals of the spiritual struggle everyone faces, the characters of Betrayed depict real people who have stepped away from their faith and find themselves returning as they deal with past mistakes and face the future. A fast-paced novel that keeps the reader rivoted, never knowing which way it will turn, it shines through with life values of the Christian faith. This book stands alone.
