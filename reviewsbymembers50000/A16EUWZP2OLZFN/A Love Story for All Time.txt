 I have read this book several times and have encouraged others to read it. It is a love story for all time. Beautifully portraying Priscilla and Aquila and their time spent together in support of Paul. Today's modern woman might at first bristle at the thought of a woman eating separate from the man and some of the other customs decribed from the time. However, when the reader takes the deeper look and puts the story in perspective of the New Testament time and culture in which it is written, the incredible love story woven between these two will permeate your own relationships and enlarge your heart.
