 Maya Angelou poignantly puts, "If growing up is painful for the Southern Black girl, being aware of her displacement is the rust on the razor that threatens the throat. It is an unnecessary insult." Angelou's book, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," is cast in small minuets, each complete unto itself, yet each an intricate piece of "the humorless puzzle on inequality and hate." This book shows "the heavy burden of blackness" under which most Blacks found themselves not-so-long-ago in America. Through the impressions Angelou marks on the reader's conscience and intelligence, one can only hope that American society has improved, guaranteeing the equal footing for present and future generations. Angelou's autobiography, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", makes the reader change "from being ignorant of being ignorant to being aware of being aware." As Angelou's Marguerite declares, "[she] comprehended the perversity of life, that in the struggle lies the joy." Her name wasn't, Mary. Her name isn't Mary. Read the book to find out why.
