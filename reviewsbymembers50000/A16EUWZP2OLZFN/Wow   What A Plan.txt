 You have got to get this workbook if you are serious about seeing your first-time novel published. Evan Marshall breaks down the process into clear steps that really help the author to define the novel's characters, plot, relationships, pace, and so forth. I was astounded how quickly and in-depth my characters took shape, how the schemes, scenes and plots developed my manuscript to something that I can see being completed and ready for publishing soon. The Marshall Plan Workbook was the "write" plan for me. See if it is for you.
