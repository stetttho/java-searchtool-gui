 "God Allows U-Turns - Stories of Hope and Healing" by Allison Gappa Bottke is going to blow out the doors of traditional story collections. The first book in the God Allows U-Turns Series is a collection of 100 true life-changing stories from people around the world. Included are stories that give the reader a warm fuzzy like Lea MacDonald's, "Everybody Knows Everybody" where six-year-old Brandon states, "We all 'comed from God. He made us all." There are the touching tearjerkers, as in Candace Carteen's, "In God's Eyes," that cause you to see others as God might see them. "The Garden" by Alex and Dawn Edwards shows how everyday faith can change people's lives as a gang constantly taunts an old gardener. Walking in his faith, the gardener touches the heart of one gang member in particular, changing his life forever. "God Allows U-Turns - Stories of Hope and Healing" faces hard-hitting topics head-on like divorce, addictions and abuse. Bottke's own story, the genesis of the project, proclaims that you don't have to continue down that dead-end road. You can change your direction, drastically and eternally with His guidance and begin a new journey on the road of life. "God Allows U-Turns" is a book of hope and healing to all. Regardless of the wrong choices you have made in your life, no matter the rocky path you are traveling - God Allows U-Turns.
