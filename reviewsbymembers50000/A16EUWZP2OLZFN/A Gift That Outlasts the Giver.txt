 A Letter is a Gift Forever, as is Florence Littauer's book by the same name. A beautiful book that is as lovely to read as it is to hold, it blends the blessing of past niceties with future joy. Florence Littauer demonstrates how a written word of love, encouragment, thanks or even forgiveness from the heart outlasts the actual heart. Drawing on a collection of letters that spans the generations, these written words inspire us all to write to those whom we love and care for, it's never too late. The joy  received from the blessing sent in a letter will last forever.
