 In Claude Brown's, "Manchild in the Promised Land", the author regales the reader with a starkly realistic portrayal of Harlem. The autobiography, written in narrative form, walks the reader through the childhood and early manhood of Sonny, Claude Brown. The writer pulls no punches as he hits the page with an intense anger of the circumstances that created the culture of Harlem in the 1940s and 1950s, and to great extent contribute to the same chaos today. Written in 1965, "Manchild in the Promised Land" could be referred to as a streetwise primer. It's clear, lucid prose gives unflinching detail to the black man's experience living in the ghetto. Brown recalls his childhood with pleasure and pride, a childhood defined by violence, crime and drug addiction. This honest pride is evidenced in many reverse values from "traditional" society, of those living outside the ghetto. Brown shows how these opposite values come about naturally, giving the living conditions, and how they become survival techniques that make sense. In the 1950s, no one actually lived in Harlem, they survived or died, according to Brown's account. Touted as the story of one who made it out of Harlem successfully, Claude Brown's "Manchild in the Promised Land" is the story of Sonny, a man who stands where a manchild ran.
