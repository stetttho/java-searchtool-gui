 Once I picked it up, I couldn't put down Dee Henderson's, The Negotiator. With the fast-paced feel of current television hits like C.S.I. and The Agency, Henderson's main character, Kate O'Malley negotiates hostage situations with the ease and grace of the professional she is. O'Malley - one of a set of seven "siblings" - orphans that banned together as children - learns to negotiate her heart and soul through time spent with FBI agent, Dave Richman. Richman, who falls for Kate while the two work their way out of a bank bombing, can't give his heart until he is sure of Kate's relationship with God. Henderson easily incorporates the gospel message into The Negotiator and gives the reader a fresh perspective on heart and soul matters, while delivering a romantic suspense that rocks the socks.
