 Good feeling, catchy melodies and harmonies with folky, psychedelic lyrics. Lots of acoustic guitar, always a plus. But there are a lot of different instruments on this record. The sum is greater than the parts. The album sounds familiar and new at the same time. It really is a new kind of pop music.  I haven't heard either the Shins or Califone, so I'll compare Fruit Bats to the Beatles, Kinks, Velvet Underground, maybe even early, pre-ambient Brian Eno. It's great music!
