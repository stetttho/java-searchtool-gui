 I've been intereted in Jim Loehr's work since picking up a copy of his Mental Toughness Training a long time ago. I got this one a couple of months ago, and it's a really great model of life management, possibly the best in the field. It has helped me tremendously. I was especially impressed with the authors's take on the importance of ritual. Highly, highly recommended for people looking to make a change.
