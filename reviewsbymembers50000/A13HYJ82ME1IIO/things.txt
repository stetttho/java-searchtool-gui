 Having a scale is great for portion control.  This scale looks artful and is accurate, but there are 2 things I don't like about it. The turn off button and the reset button don't work very well, and the grams/ounces switch is very difficult to reach. And yes, I find the grams/ounces switch to be important, since on all packaging serving size calories are always given in grams, but most other sources of info give calorie info in ounces.
