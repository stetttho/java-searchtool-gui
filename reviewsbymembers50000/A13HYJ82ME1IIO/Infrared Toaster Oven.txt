 I use this appliance a lot, possibly more than I use my microwave oven. Cooking takes longer, but is just as simple. This toaster oven is a great product and a great value. It's worth it just for what it can do with individual-sized frozen pizzas, especially if you cook them directly on the rack. I've been eating healthier as well, because the oven also does a great job with those meatless burgers found in the freezer section. They get crispy. The secret's in the infrared.
