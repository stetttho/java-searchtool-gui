 This thing is great. It's smaller than a pack of cigarettes, and the sound is awesome. Setting it up took less than 10 minutes, and I was listening to tracks in about another 5 minutes, thanks to the included MusicMatch Jukebox and the super-simple Intel Audio Manager. It's great for exercising because of its size. The controls are easy to understand and use.
