 This is really a fantastic book. It's not so much a novel but a collection of short stories that have an over-riding theme, that theme being love. The characters are vivid and alive, and the writing is fun, so reading it was never a chore. I read this book over a period of several months, taking it out every 2 weeks at the laundromat. Because of the short story progression of the novel, this worked great.
