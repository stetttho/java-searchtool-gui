 Amazon tells me I bought this in October 2004. Paradoxically, it doesn't seem like I've been using McGhee's system that long and at the same time it seems like I've been using it for years and years. It's very natural, simple, and easy to do. I have a windows mobile device and this system is perfect for it.   It does seem like it was derived from Allen's Getting Things Done book, but McGhee ports the idea to use in Outlook, without the need for another application.
