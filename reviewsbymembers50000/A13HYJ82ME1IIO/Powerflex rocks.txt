 I had been using another Bronze Bow Publishing book, The Miracle Seven, as my primary exercise routine for about a year and wanted a change. So I got this book and followed the Level 1, 8 week routine. 15 minutes a session, and did the sessions anywhere from 4 to 7 days a week. No gym equipment is necessary. These exercises can be done in the comfort of your home.  The author, Jim Forystek, names each exercise using animal metaphors, such as Gorilla Flex or Shark Flex. I like this, and think it helps.  My transformation has me totally astounded. I never thought that developing a powerful body like this could be done in such a short period of time, and with enjoyable, easy to do exercises at low rep counts. Powerflex does work! I'm living proof.   I look and feel great. Never before in my life have women touched my arms and shoulders during casual conversation like they have been since I've been on this program. Having a muscular body rocks, and following the routines in this book will develop one.
