 Not necessarily recommended to those who shy away from the bleaker perspectives, but these are great stories.  _The Day of the Locust_ is set in film making L.A. of the 30's(?) and the main character, Homer Simpson, does not exactly fit in.  Because of this, his adventures bring out many of the oddities and illnesses of the culture.  You feel that even though he can't express his situation and environment, his subconscious is somehow in tune with it.     _Miss Lonelyhearts_ was also written in the 30's, I think, although I can't really recall the exact setting.  Miss Lonelyhearts is a newspaperman drawn to self-abuse and melancholy swings and his job writing the daily advice column under the pseudonym of the title provides plenty of 'food for the soul,' so to speak.  (Boy, that sure sounds like a back-of-jacket blurb.  Oh well.)    Both stories are pretty short.  I'm a slow reader that rarely reads the same book twice (there's just so much else out there), but I reread these both recently in a day and thoroughly enjoyed them again.
