 True, but _Johanna_ is kinda bluesy, which is interesting to hear.  AND that's not just a blurry photo of a dead donkey (llama?) on the cover -- it's a 3D photo of a dead whatever, whith 3D glasses and a neanderthal mug  shot on the inside.  In short, if you're an Iggy fan who thinks 3/4 of his  stuff is worth owning then this is for you.
