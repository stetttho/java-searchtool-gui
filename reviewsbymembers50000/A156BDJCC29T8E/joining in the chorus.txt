 Yes, this is a great album.  As noted below, the sound quality is *very*  good for a 32-year-old live recording.  I've heard some of the songs in  multiple different styles/tempos/versions on other recordings, and the ones  on this album are up there in beauty.  Highly recommended for the fan and  the Dylan newbie, although there is something to be said for the design of  original albums like Bringing it All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited.   Buy them all.
