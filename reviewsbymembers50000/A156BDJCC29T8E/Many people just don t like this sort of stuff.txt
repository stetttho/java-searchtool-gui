 ...but I'd rather be one of the few who finds pleasure in Self's perversity than one of the many who see only perveristy in such pleasures (as those of the wanton that is Self's Henry Wotton).    Perhaps you should skip this tale if you:  ) rarely find reinterpretations as enjoyable -- note that this is not the same as 'good' -- as an original or 'classic'  ) are offended by repeated discussions of drugs, sex, homosexuality, precious bodily fluids, et cetera  ) haven't read any of his other works; or have, and don't like such  ) don't like it when authors make much wordplay or use obscure vocabulary which might require the reader to visit a dictionary   Note: I am a big fan of Mr. Self.  You also may find his writing very entertaining if you don't fall into any of the above buckets.  If you're interested in checking for yourself, I would recommend the short story collection _Grey Area_ or the novel _Great Apes_.  (The only major book of his that I did not find highly enjoyable was _How the Dead Live_, which was a little tedious.)  So there you have my opinion.  It's just that.  But do take the reviews of those who panned this book as such as well.  There's no accounting for taste; however, I personally recommend that you taste this account of a modern Dorian Gray.  Terrible, I know;).
