 Unlike most of the below reviewers, I found this book to be quite engaging.  I can't help but think them put off by the horrid nature of the tale.  Call me childish and sick, but I liked this well written and quite fantastic story.  An unabashed five stars.    Also, what's the problem with big words?  If you'd rather read at a tenth grade level then go ahead and stick with most any other contemporary writer.  I think you'll find that Self's choice of an exotic word over a more mundane possibility often adds to the detailed desciptive quality of his writing.  Note that no one has accused him of mis-using his large vocabulary.   This book is not a great work of literature, BTW, but not all books are supposed to be.  Some are more for fun, and this one is  just not everyone's idea of it apparently. Disclaimer:  I am a big Will Self fan.  However, I am not liking his new novel (_How the Dead Live_) very much, so know that I can also be critical of his work.
