 Say what you will about other Ween that is better or worse in this or that respect, but I think it's a matter of taste.  For me, this is one of the slicker ones and I can listen to it a fair bit (this from someone who often plays even new albums only once a week).  Nice variety yet there is a  certain continuity to the album as a whole.  Works real well while high, so  take a puff or three and kick back with a good beer or whatever else you  like and crank the volume to your personal level for optimal absorption.   Ween rocks.
