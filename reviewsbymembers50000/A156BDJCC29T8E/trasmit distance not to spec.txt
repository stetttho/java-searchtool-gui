 The specs say 150 feet indoors and 1000 feet outdoors.  I can barely get 100 feet outdoors.  Also, I think that the other reviewers who are complaining about sound quality have a point, although I personally don't  care about crystal clear voices -- I just want to hear the words without  them clipping when I walk to my garage.  I will probably be returning this  item if I can find a similar product with longer range.
