 While there's a little Bone Machine-ness to some of the less melodic tracks, the album is definitely a little more listenable. (Don't get me wrong, I like BM.)  Some songs remind me of ones on Franks Wild Years.   Unlike that album, and a few others now that I think of it, there is not  much of a theme to the Mule Variations songs.  Good album though.
