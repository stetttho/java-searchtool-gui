 The book was well written and the story well told, but I feel that more  time spent on the girls' personal histories is called for. While the crime  itself is well chronicled, and more than enough time is devoted to the  girls' life in prison, I didn't really get the feeling of actually knowing  any of these girls -- least of all, the victim herself. Only a few pages  were given to each character's background.
