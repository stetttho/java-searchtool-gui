 This book was very well researched and detailed, but I would have liked to have seen more character history. The first 1/4 of the book described the crime scene and the investigation and the rest detailed the trial. I found myself wanting to know more about the key characters' histories, particularly Kirby Anthoney's. I love true crime but always enjoy delving into the killer's childhood and background more than the trial.
