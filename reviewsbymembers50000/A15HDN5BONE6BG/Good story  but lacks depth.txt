 This is a very ironic case, where a single mother who is well known in her  community for her tough stance against gangs turns out to be the ringleader  of one. Unfortunately, while the story itself is very interesting, the book  is not written all that well. I felt it lacked depth. I think more detail  and more background is called for, to give the reader the feeling of  knowing the characters. There were also some confusing and/or conflicting  passages. Worth reading, but not one of my favorite true crime books.
