 I disagree with the other reviewer, who I don't think was fair to this  book or its author. While it's not the best I've ever read, it was good and  certainly worth the price. I felt I got to know the main characters fairly  well, and the trial was covered in some detail without bogging the reader  down in dry legal prose. As for the other reviewer's comments about the  pictures not matching the text, I have no idea what he's referring to...  the pictures were of the crime scene, the victims, and the prosecutors.
