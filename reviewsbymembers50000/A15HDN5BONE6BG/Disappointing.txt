 I'm afraid I have to agree with the majority this time... I'm a true-crime  buff, and I found this book to be somewhere between 'mediocre' and  'disappointing'. While the story was interesting, it was not very well  written, and it was definitely lacking in depth. The reader is left  wondering what really happened the night of the murder, because the killing  itself is barely touched upon. Also, I did not get any sense of  "getting to know" the characters -- not any of them. The last  third of the book was downright boring, and the reader is left with many  questions. I wouldn't recommend this book.
