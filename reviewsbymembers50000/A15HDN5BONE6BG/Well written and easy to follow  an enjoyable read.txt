 This book was written with an easy to follow timeline. The characters come  to life and seem real; the reader can feel sympathy for each of them, even  those one doesn't expect to. Little is said about the actual murder itself  because, of the only two people that were there, the victim is dead and the  killer keeps changing his story. So the reader is left not knowing how Tina  really died, but it doesn't seem so important by the end of the book. What  matters is that she is gone from this world; I feel it would've taken away  from the story to sensationalize on the gory aspects. All in all, this book  is definitely worth reading.
