 This book is an interesting blend of fact and fiction. I recommend it for horror/suspense novel fans. It is well-written, in the same intriguing style as the author's true crime books, and I like the way it combines fact  (Ed Gein's story) with fiction. However, if the reader is not already well  versed in the true story of Ed Gein, he or she may have trouble knowing  where the fact ends and the fiction begins. Still, it is an entertaining  story, even if it is a bit far-fetched, as are most novels that try to  mimic true crime.
