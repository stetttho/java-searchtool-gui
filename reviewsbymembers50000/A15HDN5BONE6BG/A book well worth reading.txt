 This is the story of Robert Ben Rhoades, a trucker who preyed on  hitchhikers and women he picked up at truckstops. He tortured, then  sometimes killed them. Also included is an in-depth look at the woman who  was first charmed by him, then slowly exposed to his darker appetites, and  went on to marry him and became one of this victims. I also liked the  author's detailed explanations of how facial reconstruction can be done  from a skull. All in all, a very good book.
