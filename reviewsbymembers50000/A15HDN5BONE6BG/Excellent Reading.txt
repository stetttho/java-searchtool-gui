 This is one of the better true-crime books I've read. What a horrific crime! What a disturbed person! One almost feels sorry for Darci, yet her gruesome crime is unforgivable. This book was well researched and very well  written. I found myself neglecting everything around me until I finished  this book; I simply couldn't put it down!
