 You don't often see mass murderers in their 70's! That alone makes this an  interesting and entertaining book. However, I was disappointed at the lack  of detail in this book. I never felt I got to 'know' any of the characters,  least of all the main character, Ray Copeland himself. If the author had  put more time into researching the background of the Copelands and their  victims, this would be a far better read.
