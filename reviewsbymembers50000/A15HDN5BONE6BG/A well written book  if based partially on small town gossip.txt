 This is a well written book, seemingly well researched, although another  reviewer disagrees and  I cannot verify the accuracy of the information.  Much of the book does seem to be based on gossip and one person's  reputation in a town, but that doesn't mean it's inaccurate. There are  several references to facts that were not made public or not brought out in  trial but we're never really told why. All in all, this book is well worth  reading.
