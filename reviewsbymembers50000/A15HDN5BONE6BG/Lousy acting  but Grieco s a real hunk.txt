 The plot has definate potential, but the movie was unfortunately ruined by poor acting from both stars, neither of whom seemed capable of reading their lines with any emotion at all. The ninety minutes I spent watching this film was saved from being a total waste only by the sight of Richard Grieco, however -- his acting talents might be minimal, but his sex appeal kept me glued to the screen. And male viewers will be equally appreciative of Angie Everhart's nude scenes. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie.
