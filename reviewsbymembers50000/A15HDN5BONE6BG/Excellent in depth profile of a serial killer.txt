 This is one of the best true crime books I've ever read, and I've read hundreds. It is very well-written and gives detailed insight into what went on in Tom Luther's mind. The reader gets to know the 'two Toms' -- the Good  Tom and the Bad Tom, and we see him as a human being, not just his criminal  side that the media reports. Additionally, the reader gets to know Deb  Snider, the woman who loves Good Tom enough to put up with Bad Tom year  after year; it's very easy to say she was stupid to tolerate his treatment  of her, but the author does a great job of helping you understand why she  did so. Highly recommended reading for true crime fans!
