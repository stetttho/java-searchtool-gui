 This is an excellent book. True, the stories are not in-depth, but they're not intended to be. Each chapter is about a different killer who practiced cannibalism. While the topic is horrible, the presentation is fascinating.  The author's extensive knowledge of the subject is impressive, as are her  theories on such related topics as vampires and werewolves. I highly  recommend this book, but you need to have a strong stomach...
