 This account of a cold-blooded double-murder of the killer's ex-girlfriend  and his own daughter is interesting and well written. I especially like  that the trial and sentencing were covered but without taking up half the  book which often happens in true crime; the reader is not left hanging by  not knowing how it ends, yet is not bored with dry legal transcipts and  life histories of all the attorneys, either. I highly recommend this book!
