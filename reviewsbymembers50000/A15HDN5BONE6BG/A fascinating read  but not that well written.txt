 This is probably the most gruesome case of child abuse I've ever heard of.  This woman's cruelty and inhumanity is beyond any normal person's  comprehension. For that reason only, the book is virtually impossible to  put down. As other reviewers have pointed out, it is not very well written.  There are numerous inconsistancies throughout the pages. Nevertheless, as  soon as I finished it, I immediately went web-surfing, searching for more  information on this hideous case; I ordered "Mother's Day" by  Dennis McDougal.
