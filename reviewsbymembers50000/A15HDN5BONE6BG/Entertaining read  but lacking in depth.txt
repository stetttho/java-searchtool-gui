 I found the book hard to put down -- in fact, I read it straight through in a matter of hours. I was greatly entertained, but found myself hungry for more details. This series of crimes, in my opinion, is unparalleled in  regards to cruelty and gruesomeness, with the possible exception of Jeffrey  Dahmer's murders. But I was left with many unanswered questions. The book's  316 pages of large type was just not enough to delve into even ONE of these  crimes in any real depth, much less all of them, and the trials were  skimmed over even faster. All in all, I recommend the book for its  entertainment value, but I  would think most true crime fans will be left  unsatisfied.
