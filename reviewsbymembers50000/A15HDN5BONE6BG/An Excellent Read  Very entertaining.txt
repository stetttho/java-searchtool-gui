 I thoroughly enjoyed every word of this book. Not one word failed to hold my interest. It tells the story of a wealthy, married American swimsuit model who seemingly has it all yet inexplicably falls in love with a Greek  sailor, who no one can understand what she sees in him. She then gives up  her husband and even her small daughter to be with this man, but it doesn't  take long for her to realize her mistake. Unfortunately, she dies violently  at his hand before she gets away from him. My only complaint about this  book is that it goes into much detail about the victim but very little is  learned about her lover who killed her. It's definitely worth reading!
