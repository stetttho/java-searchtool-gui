 I first heard of this movie when I saw it up for auction at eBay, and wondered why I hadn't heard of it before, seeing as I am always looking for family movies and Chihuahua items both. But after one veiwing, I now know why! This is obviously a home video recorded by someone with too much time on his hands who somehow managed to get it packaged up nicely and marketed. With only a handful of actors, none of whom can talk in anything other than a monotone, and shaky film footage, I can't imagine how this ever got into production. I doubt that it would hold even a small child's interest. A serious waste of time.
