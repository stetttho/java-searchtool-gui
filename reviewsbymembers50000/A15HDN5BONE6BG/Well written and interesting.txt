 I enjoyed reading this book and found it well written and detailed. I personally don't buy the "Adopted Child Syndrome" as an excuse for murder, nor do I think most readers will, but it was the last resort of  a desperate defense team. Some of the trial scenes toward the end got a bit  dry, but all in all, this book is worth reading.
