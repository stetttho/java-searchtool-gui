 I don't feel this book was the best true crime I've ever read, but it  certainly doesn't qualify as the worst, either. It doesn't deserve the  single star that other reviewers have given it. While I agree that it's  lacking in depth and detail, it is not boring or dry. I would have liked,  however, to have read about both the killer's and the victim's backgrounds.  I never really felt that I got to know any of the characters.
