 This is a well-edited edition of Sun Tzu; the only aspect that left something to be desired was the inclusion of illustrative anecdotes; I would have preferred if they were left to the end of the chapter. I can understand why this book was a fad in the business world but object to claims that the tactics described in this book are easily applied to business.  This is a book about conflict, specifically, war, and there is much wisdom lost if it is taken out of its context.  There is much excellent advice for analogous situations; political persuasion and debate, games of Go, Shogi or Chess, or even sporting events. When taken from the world of conflict to the business, the realm of cooperation (in the sense that competing businesses compete to cooperate the best with their customers), The Art of War becomes yet another tome of "Eastern" sayings which sound pretty and can be "applied to any situation" only because they come to mean very little. Those who will be in a conflict situation or wish to prepare for one, even if it is a simple game of Go, should study this book.  Read the text and the anecdotes, and come back later to read it again gaining fresh insight.
