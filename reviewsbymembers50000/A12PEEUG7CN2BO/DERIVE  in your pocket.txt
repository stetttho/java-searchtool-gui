 This calculator is undoubtably TI's best yet.  All of the features of the 92+, except Cabri Geometry (which may be added) are present here, at less cost and in a smaller case. I wouldn't recommend this calculator to high school students who think they'd be tempted into not learning the math.   And for engineers and others who deal with a lot of numerics, I'd recommend  the HP 49 (despite its easily scratched screen). What this machine excels  in is symbolic manipulation.  It's like having a copy of Soft Warehouse's  DERIVE on a dedicated, portable machine.  The calculator excels at solving  equations and can even handle some differential equations.  There have been  several integrations for which the 89 has given me cleaner results closer  to the form I expected than Wolfram Mathematica or Waterloo Maple.   It's  programmable (with growing support from the consumer end), and people have  written software that does LaPlace transforms, Bessel functions, 3D CAD,  and more.  The 3D graphing engine, TI's main  selling point, leaves a lot to be desired (it only does two variable  functions--no parametric plots, CAD, implicitly defined surfaces, etc) but  the rest of the graphics are nice. While this machine is not as powerful  Mathematica for symbolic math or MathCAD for numerics, it is an excellent  tool and the best all-around machine out there.
