 This book is a classic in the Libertarian movement, and is thus somewhat untouchable.  It is a great book, offering Bergland's brand of Libertarianism and many libertarian solutions in a simple yet thought-provoking fashion. However, it is very dry and will not appeal to all.  Those who couldn't care less about economics would not like this book.  Granted, most Libertarians do care about them but that is only after realizing how economic liberty is really not separate from personal liberty. I'd recommend this as a primer for those who are new to the movement but already consider themselves Libertarians.  For those who aren't I'd recommend something like Harry Browne's Great Libertarian Offer, Virginia Postrel's The Future and Its Enemies, or a few current issues of Reason magazine to give you an impression of what Libertarianism, the politics of free minds and free markets, is all about.
