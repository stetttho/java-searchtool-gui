 One would expect a lot more for the price of this book.  Instead of being a comprehensive guide or even complete introduction to LaTeX, this book is a nearly cursory introduction. Commands and options are not described in detail, leaving a lot of guesswork in doing simple tasks like laying out equations, including an abstract, or including graphics.  How to program your own environments is left for the Latex Companion.  The reference section in the back is poorly laid out and missing quite a bit of information. The book is a good introduction for those who have never used LaTeX but gives very little for one's money; books on other computer-related topics, from C to HTML tend to be more comprehensive.  I'd recommend this book only because there aren't many basic introductions to LaTeX in existence.
