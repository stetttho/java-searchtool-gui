 Red beans and rice is such a simple dish.  Everybody in New Orleans eats it on Mondays, from cab drivers and port workers to businesspeople and Tulane kids. New Orleaneans (native or adopted, displaced or otherwise) know that red beans and rice is a very subtle dish.  The beans at Dunbar's, Mother's, and Ye Olde College Inn (all famous for the dish) are all different, and everybody's mother has her own recipe, too.  There are many variables involved in getting it to come out just right, from the choice of meat to the number of bay leaves to add to the pot.   The most important is in choosing beans.  Red beans and rice cooked by displaced New Orleaneans elsewhere doesn't always come out as creamy as people in the city are used to--often they're thick and starchy and the beans need to be put in a blender to get anything resembling the gravy in the authentic dish.  One reason for this is that Americans outside of New Orleans and the Deep South really don't eat beans, red or otherwise, and the beans sit on the shelf and toughen.  The second reason is that the "red kidney bean" popular in New Orleans is not the same thing as the kidney bean used in three-bean salad or Texas chili.  It's smaller, hence it cooks faster, gets creamier faster, and has a more intense color and flavor. Camellia beans are authentic Louisiana red beans--the small variety--and they're probably the most popular in New Orleans.  They enjoy such a good reputation because they're almost invariably fresh and they produce the creamy pot of beans that, more than any other dish, reminds us of New Orleans.
