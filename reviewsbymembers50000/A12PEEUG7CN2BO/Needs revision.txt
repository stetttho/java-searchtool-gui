 This work has such a reputation, and so much praise has been (rightly) given to it in the reviews, that it certainly does not need an endorsement; what could I say that hasn't been said? That having been said, the Chicago Manual of Style is in need of a revision.  Specifically, it does not cover issues that arise when self-typesetting books or journal articles, a common practice among mathematicians and scientists in the age of LaTeX.
