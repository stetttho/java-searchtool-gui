 Audio quality on this remastered release tops that of the CD and the original LP.  The horns are now as crisp and clear as in a concert hall.  The difference is also noticable in the organ solo in "Blues Part II"--the limits of the electronic organ and the intricacy of the solo (these guys were musicians of the first order!) can both be heard for the first time. The addition of live versions of "More and More" and "Smiling Phases" is itself a blessing to the listener.  All accounts say that Blood Sweat and Tears (all incarnations) could really jam.  The dearth of live recordings--this is the band left off of most if not all Woodstock recordings, mainly for political reasons--means that we youngsters have had to take this statement on faith.  It couldn't be more true--we hear rock musicians jamming together as tightly as jazz artists here. The liner notes have also been improved for this version, giving us a bit of the post-Kooper history of BS&T. Persons to whom I recommend against buying this record are  those who expect this to be a jam-band record a la Blind Faith or Ten Years After, or those seeking the conventional.  It did win a Grammy, but there are people out there who will not just dislike this record; they'll hate it to the point of disgust.  "What's up with the carnival music?" "This is sooo kitschy." "Who writes this stuff?" etc.  Chachun a son gout.
