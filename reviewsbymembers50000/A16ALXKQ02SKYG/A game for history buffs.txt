 Have you ever wondered about the Voynich Manuscript?  How about the Knights Templar?  Did you know why Solomon's Temple is so important to Christians and Knights Templar both?  Did you ever wonder why the ancient Egyptians might have built their pyramids? Or what made Excalibur so powerful? If you were ever curious about any of the above--or just wanted a good wine recommendation and the chance to solve some intriguing puzzles without once touching a gun this game is for you. I am not a gamer and, to be honest, this is the very first game I finished.  I quite literally could not leave it alone--the story and the puzzles alike kept me glued to my keyboard and monitor.  For in this game you as Niko and George travel to the Congo, Europe, England, Middle East, and back to England, encountering mythological characters from around the globe.  In what other game out this season can you find a dragon and Anubis side-by-side? And, of course, the good guys never, ever touch a gun.  Who needs bullets if you have smarts?  But smarts you most definitely need.  Puzzle after intriguing puzzle await you here.  And you cannot skip the cut scenes in this game--this is not a cut and slash game where the object is to kill anything that moves; here the cut scenes hold clues you will need to save the world. In fact, saving the world is about the only thing this game has in common with the slash-and-burn games we have all seen so often.  But then, after all, it IS a game. And a truly fantastic one at that.
