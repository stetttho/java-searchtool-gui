 These essays are part autobiographical, part literary review, part reflection on the 20th century as a whole.  The clearest example of the merging of these themes occurs in "Rushdie in the Louvre".  Here we find Salman Rushdie who to Cynthia Ozick "has become, in his own person, a little Israel'; and defending whom "nowadays... places one among the stereotypes and the `Orientalists'".  Here we see a man whose "right to exist is mired in the politics of anti-colonialism-and never mind the irony of this, given Rushdie's origins as a Muslim born in India."  And here too we see Rushdie's work; his literary genius.  But these themes (so concentrated in this one essay) are scattered throughout the rest of the book as well.  In this volume we find a touching portrait of Alfred Chester-a writer who might have been great; the first writer of her own generation Ozick meets; the man who (in many ways) gives her a hand up the ladder, even as he begins his own descent into death.  Here we find the warning to our generation because we are too ready to celebrate the Now at the expense of history and culture (a warning that follows on the heels of a smile-inducing history of the Temple's fight against Modernity).    And then there are some frankly personal essays.  "Helping T.S. Eliot Write Better" will make any editor cringe; "Of Christian Heroism" is as much a personal rumination on human nature as it is an ode to Christians who saved Jews during the Holocaust.   But no essay in this volume is impersonal.  There are some themes that run through them, of course: anti-totalitarianism, anti-racism, anti-sameness, an abiding admiration for Western culture and literature and an even greater one for the creative spirit. But the author of these essays is ever present.  In "Isaac Babel and the Identity Question", Cynthia Ozick decries the lack of "a valid biography of Babel."  In this volume of essays, she has (I think) begun to write her own.
