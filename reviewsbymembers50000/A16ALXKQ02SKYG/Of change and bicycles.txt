 This, as Amos Oz, says is a simple story about a boy who "once was given a bicycle and swapped it for a railway; got a dog instead; found a pencil sharpener in place of the dog and gave the dog away for love."  But it is so much more than that.  It is a story about change, about growing up, about dreams.  It is a story about families, their loves and even their politics.  It is a story about occupation and colonialism.  It is a story of Jerusalem.  But most of all, it is a story about a boy who gets his very first bicycle and declares his very first love on the same day.  And it is sure to touch the hearts of all those who have ever grown up (or who have ever considered doing so).  I highly recommend this book.
