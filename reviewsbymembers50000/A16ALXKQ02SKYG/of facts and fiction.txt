 What is a biography?  That is the question that haunts me now that I have put this incredible book down.  Is it a simple exercise of "finding your facts, selecting your facts, arranging your facts, considering missing facts, and explaining your facts" or is it, like all writing, a river flowing "toward the writer's own body and the writer's own experience"?  Is a biography then, in some way, an auto-biography?  After all, what is a fact (and how is it different from fiction)?  And what makes this (and not that) fact important?  How will I (or a biographer) know it when we see it?  And what, in the end, is "experience"?  This story, as much of a mystery as a story, grapples with these and other questions.  I was not necessarily satisfied with the answers-tentative as they were-at the end but that was not the point.  The point was the question; and the question is a good one.  It made me think.
