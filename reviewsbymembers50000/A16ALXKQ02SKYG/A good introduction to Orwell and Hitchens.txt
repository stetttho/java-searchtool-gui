 Orwell's work, writes Hitchens demonstrates "that politics are relatively unimportant, while principles have a way of enduring, as do the few irreducible individuals who maintain their allegiance to them."  This statement is as true of Hitchens as it is of Orwell.  For, to both these men, the great sin is compromising one's principles for the sake of realpolitik.  Perhaps because he feels a political kinship with Orwell, Hitchens' essay about him is so passionate.  In it, Hitchens defends Orwell from attacks from the Left (including from Hitchens' good friend Edward Said); takes pains to point out that Orwell cannot be read as a creature of the Right (a charge often leveled at Hitchens himself); and shows too that Orwell's was the face of the decent Englishman (one who, like Hitchens, was deeply ambivalent about `Englishness').  And yet to Hitchens' credit, this is not an idealized portrait of Orwell.  Hitchens does not close his eyes to Orwell's lapses such as his lifelong detestation of homosexuality and feminism; nor is he blind to the racial prejudices Orwell worked his life to overcome.  Hitchens reports these human failings honestly; without attempting to "whitewash" them.  The result is a genuine and eminently readable book that serves as good an introduction to Orwell as it does to Hitchens.  I highly recommend it.
