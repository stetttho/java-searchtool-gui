 We hear about many people nowadays who are called "leaders of this or that people"; this is a biography of a man who really was a leader of a people and as such, it is good to read this short and critically-acclaimed biography to discover what a people's leader is.   In these pages, Benjamin Franklin emerges as a man who "did as much as any to shape the world he and" his contemporaries lived.  Here we see a person who throughout his life sought to determine what was in the public interest and who then tried to persuade the people to act for their own good.  But he never tried to place what he thought good "above what they did".  Furthermore, he never tried to gain even adequate compensation for his long and hard years as a public servant because he believed that private property was not a natural but a society-given right and that society should therefore see to it that no-one had too much wealth. This, of course, is not a view often associated with the author of the Poor Man's Almanac-even though he held this opinion since at least 1750 when he wrote that "what we have above what we can use, is not properly ours, tho' we possess it."  Yet it is a view that we in a time littered with corrupt politicians who steal several million here and a billion there; who impose their idea of what is good on a people who as often as not are forced to obey or be killed; in a time when these thugs are yet called "leaders", might do well to recall.   For here in a little over 300 pages we have a portrait of a true leader.  A man who spoke little, listened a lot, and who led Americans to independence (although he would have personally preferred a British Empire of Equals).  It would be good for us to remember this man for we live in a time when the men we call leaders are often anything but.  Yet, perhaps when we recognize what makes a true leader we will once again have them.
