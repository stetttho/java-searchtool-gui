 This is a terribly written book in the sense that it was written for academics and by academics.  I have been reading it on and off since it was recommended to me about a year ago.  To understand it, you have to be well-versed in Hegel and Foucault and Said among others. But it's a VERY important book.  It calls for a return to historiography in the true sense of the word and an end to the ideal types of Foucault and Said of object/subject; colonialist/colonizer.  Or, as the book itself puts it, what is needed is a study of non-ideal and non-homogenous society but a society "constituted by at least two conflicting traditions." All our histories are far, far richer than that and to say that all we are is either one or the other (as many of our history departments do) is to do all of us an injustice.  What is more, the monolithic situation of the "other" simply makes no historical sense.  "The real situation in the colonies never breaks down into an absolute binary between pure opposing forces.  Reality always presents proliferating multiplicities."  We are not just object/subject or colizer/colonized and to call us by these ideal types alone is to do us all an injustice. This book says that-but in very academic terms.  Nonetheless, it is a very important book that should be debated in our universities.
