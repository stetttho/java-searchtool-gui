 In this book, AIPAC is presented as an all-powerful lobby; indeed the only lobby in the US.  All the mistakes we have made in our dealings in the Middle East are laid at its door.  A good example is the USS Liberty incident.  Instead of an analysis of how a ship came under friendly fire in wartime the book builds an elaborate conspiracy theory to cover up the inciedent and places AIPAC at its head.    The facts of course are quite different. There were numerous investigations into the incident, countless books, and several movies.  If AIPAC was the head of a conspiracy to cover up anything, the conspirators should have fired AIPAC long since.  But perhaps the most disturbing element in this book is its focus on what is really a not-very-important-in the overall-scheme-of-things Jewish lobby on the Hill.  The two most important lobbies (the AARP and the NRA) are never mentioned; nor does the significant role OPEC plays in American politics get any space in this book.    No, according to this book it is the Israeli (shouldn't that be pro-Israeli?) lobby that is this book's sole target. What is more, there is more than a hint that all Jews agree (secretly or otherwise) with AIPAC.  AIPAC it seems is more than a simple lobby--it is a kind of "King of the Jews".  So a relatively unimportant lobby gets all the spotlight but the "big shots" get none.  And one is left to wonder why.  Perhaps the kindest conclusion one can draw is that this book is misleading at best.
