 This movie, loosely based on how the SAS rescued the hostages in the Iranian Embassy in 1980, is believable and not so believable. The action is believable; the demands of the terrorists(that the UK nuke Scotland) I did not find terribly believable. However, there are two parts in this action-packed movie that are truly food for thought. The first is the conversation between the British Foreign Secretary and the terrorist leader.  He asks her if she thinks she can achieve a peaceful or even a better world by murdering all the hostages.  In other words, aren't her means also her ends?  She tries to argue that but in the end concedes his point to a fellow terrorist. And the other part was the very end.  That's when the people who orchestrated the whole thing, who paid for all those deaths, cheerfully went off to dinner at some ritzy London restaurant assuring each other that there is always a next time. Indeed there is.
