 This is the chilling story of how Washington sold us out to the House of Saud and directed the CIA, FBI, and all other agencies to look the other way when the Saudis "misbehaved".  The CIA, for which Robert Baer worked, was informed in no uncertain terms that if a CIA operative "were to somehow turn over a rock and tattle to Washington [about the Saudis] his next job would be running the basement candy store in Langley." And never mind that the Saudis are currently financing every single terror cell from Chechnya to Kansas to Gaza.  (In this book you can discover, among other things, how much the operation in Kansas, USA costs.)  And never mind that this is as true today as it was before September 11, 2001. And the same "consent to silence" applies to our "new best friend in the Middle East-Qatar".  We know, of course, that Qatar's foreign minister is sending al Qaeda checks on a regular basis but that does not seem to trouble post-9/11 Washington too much.  For although this man (called "good Hamad" inside the Beltway) probably paid to have 3,000 people slaughtered on September 11, 2001 he ALSO let Enron close a multi-billion-dollar natural gas deal in Qatar.  And for that, the oil tycoons (the people who really run Washington D.C.) are prepared to overlook a few flaws. And when Robert Baer tried to get his former employer, the CIA, to pick up these many-fold threats to our national security; when he e-mailed the CIA the names, places, and targets he got a two word reply from his former bosses: "No interest". Indeed, the only man Robert Baer could find who was interested in yet more Americans being murdered was a young Wall Street Journal reporter named Danny Pearl.  Danny never lived to see this book but it is dedicated to him and to "his unrelenting search for truth". It is a book I like to think Danny would have approved of. More importantly, it is a book that any American who wants to make sure that 9/11 does not happen again MUST read.
