 "We want to beat back the Jews and kill them off," declares Mohammed Hejazi flatly.  This very articulate high school drop out is remarkably articulate about what he wants to do with his life.  "I want to be a martyr; better that I go to Paradise. I want to enter Paradise. Better that I leave this life." He assures the audience.  And it is highly likely that he will get his wish for this paperboy's hobby seems to be confronting Israeli tanks-a recreation that has already gotten his best friend killed. So dangerous is Mohammed's favorite past-time that his father has already once tried tying him up to stop him.  To no avail.  And the fact that even such direct parental involvement has not helped as well as harrowing scenes of Palestinians being wheeled into hospitals certainly highlights how much little Mohammed hates and despise the Jews and some of the forces that have made him declare so matter of factly that he wants to kill the Jews and become a martyr. But what is perhaps most interesting about the film is its one-sidedness.  For despite frequent mention of the Jews they are never seen; they are like the horrible evil in the background of this story.  The evil one cannot see; the evil that one must by definition fear. And the few glimpses we do get of the Jews (the Israeli flag, the tanks, the bullets we must presume are Israeli) only emphasize their terrifying non-presence.   The total effect is breathtaking in its cinematographic splendor and that nonetheless flirts with propaganda.
