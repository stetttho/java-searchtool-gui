 This is the story of a human and a political friendship.  A seemingly unlikely friendship between a Tory Prime Minister and a Progressive President.  A friendship between an extroverted, warm human being and an introverted, many layered and often secretive man.  A friendship between two men who lived in a time not so very different from our own, when certainties were few, enemies seemed to spring up like mushrooms, and the whole world in danger. Their friendship did much to save that world.  It was a friendship that made D-Day possible; and it was in part thanks to that friendship that Winston and Franklin made a joint decision to avenge, not save the victims of the Holocaust.  Their decisions saved and cost millions of lives.  They were two friends, doing their best in a world plunged into darkness.  And they brought it out again-together. Winston Churchill led Britain when that island stood alone against Hitler for one year; Franklin Roosevelt patiently prodded an isolationist nation into accepting the responsibility that comes with power.  And in the end, they made a "world that is for many a better one than existed before" (283). Thanks to their efforts, when "an American President and a British prime minister [today] walk through the woods of Camp David, or confer on a transatlantic telephone, they are working in the style and in the shadow of Roosevelt and Churchill. [They are reaffirming] the Anglo-American alliance [that] has been the bedrock of global order for decades" (366). A bedrock Winston and Franklin created in those fraught years of a world war.
