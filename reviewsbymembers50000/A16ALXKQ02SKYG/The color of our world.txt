 These three short stories about how women see our world --- the colors they see, the sounds they hear, the thoughts they think-- are truly remarkable for their philosophic depth and their word craftsmanship.  In some ways, reading these stories (stories attuned to the everyday details of our lives); stories that describe the ringing of the phone, the belt buckle of the hairdresser; the color of the still-alive lobster in his "cage" with as much, if not more, attention as they do the "big themes" of life, death, and marriage.  They are haunting, they are short and crisp and precise.  The language flows gracefully and forcefully (though you do not notice the force until later; until you have closed the book). And they stay with you.
