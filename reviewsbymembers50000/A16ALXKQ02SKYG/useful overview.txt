 This is a useful overview to anyone (patient, independent practitioner, non-profit, local governmental agency, university teaching mental health practitioners, or government agency) that specializes or deals with the delivery of specialty mental health care to persons with serious mental illness.  It provides all the various perspectives and identifies many useful pitfalls.  And (most importantly) it at least hints at several ways of providing consumer-centered health care in an increasingly managed care environment.  Perhaps the only issue I have with this book is the self-congratulatory tone of several chapters.  Some of the contributors were having their contract/proposal reviewed at the time they were writing their chapters and used the chapters (in part) as a kind of "sales pitch" to the government agency.  The resulting tone of "look how great and worthy of funding I am" is occasionally distracting from the very real and valuable information contained in this slim volume (including their chapters).  But despite this relatively minor quibble I can honestly say that for anyone dealing with managed mental health care this book should prove invaluable.  I recommend it.
