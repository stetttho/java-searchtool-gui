 This is the story of a Jew who tries to discover if religion can be a source of unity in the Holy Land.  He thus begins a two-year exploration of Christianity and Islam.

Yossi Halevi succeeds until "the madness comes;" until, as his brother Sheykh Ibrahim is forced into anonymity by the Palestinian Authrity. Yossi Klein Halevi succeeded but, as Sheykh Ibrahim tells him (in English; using Hebrew is too dangerous for a man whom Arafat warned not to fraternize with Jews) "This is the time of the fanatics... I am crying every night." Let us all cry.
