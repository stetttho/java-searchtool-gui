 And then writes what is best described as a political tract.  In this book, which purports to take politics out of the history of ancient Israel, there is no room for archaeology--no room for the collared-rim jars the ancient Israelites left behind, no mention the four-room houses at 'Izbet Sartah and, of course, none of Merneptah Stele, the ancient tablet (dated at 1212 BCE) which is also the first discovered recorded non-biblical reference to a people and a nation called Israel. All these inconvenient facts are suppressed.  Instead, Mr. Whitelam chooses to focus on how Israel has been portrayed in the Western World.  Instead of contributing to the serious archaeological discussion on an Israel that was undoubtedly inhabited by Israelites, he instists on populating Israel with a people who came into being relatively recently and who were certainly not there in 1212 BCE and before. However, this book does prove Mr. Whitelam's thesis: history is most certainly political and none more so than his.
