 The essays in this book about the Iraq War and international law are for the most part in clear and accessible English and do not rely on theories that are left unexplained in the body of the essay itself.  For that reason I would recommend this collection to people who are interested only in the development of international law and mores and who are not much concerned with the Iraq War.  For those who are interested in the Iraq War, this collection is, I feel, indispensable.  Not because the authors agree (they do not) but because the debate in this volume has about it a quality that has been largely absent from the Iraq debate: candor.  Thus while the authors disagree on fundamental issues such as:  *	was the war in Iraq, on balance, justified;   *	did the governments that lead us to war lie or act in good faith;   *	was the suffering of the Iraqi people alone sufficient justification for war; and   *	do we have what it takes to see this war through  they do so without simplifying the arguments and without assuming that the Iraqi people agree with their positions.  For as profound as their disagreements are, the authors agree that:  *	Saddam's regime was genocidal;  *	leaving Saddam in place was not costless either (and most immediately) to the Iraqi people or (eventually) to the West; and  *	the Bush administration has terribly botched the occupation, thereby endangering the whole enterprise.  And finally these authors point out that when in a public policy debate, the liberals sound like Henry Kissinger while the conservatives echo John Rawls, the political landscape is out of joint.  This is the sort of debate liberals like myself had every right to expect in the days and months preceding the Iraq invasion.  We did not get it (for reasons addressed in this volume).  We get it here; in this collection of essays.  I highly recommend it.
