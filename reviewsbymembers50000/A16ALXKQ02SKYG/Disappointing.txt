 It is to be expected that a memoir by a Palestinian girl should not give "equal weight" to both sides of the story. But I found it very disappointing that not only did Ms Kharmi not give equal weight to the other side but that she ignored the fact that the "other side" existed at all. It's as though she was able to see the British side of things but not the Israeli one.   I hope she will keep writing--but that her next book will contain more introspection.
