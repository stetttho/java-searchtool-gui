 "I never emerged from books" Yambo tells the reader.  And he never does.  For this story is about a man who tries to read about his own life; to become a character in his many books.  It is about a boy, who after not seeing his friend kill Germans, buries himself in the fog of books and who (in many ways) never fully lives in this world again.  That is not all there is to this wonderful introduction to Umberto Eco, of course.  There is the plot.  A man, an antique book collector loses his memory and tries to recapture it in the home of his childhood.  A home he had abandoned after something happened to him there.  (What, he does not know)  There is the story of the boy growing up in Fascist Italy, learning from his parents to praise the Balilla Boy in his classroom compositions; learning about resistance from his poor classmate and learning about doubt from a partisan who takes a liking to him.  There is the story of a first love and affairs and a family.  But above all, this is a novel about books and reading and how books can come to seem more real than life, can become life itself.  I highly recommend it.
