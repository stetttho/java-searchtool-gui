 This is a very useful tool for someone who needs to read and understand federal bills.  It may also help remind (at least moderately experienced) drafters of the things to watch for when drafting legislation.  (Although the author's occasional pompousness can be distracting.) However, if you have never drafted a bill before, this book will probably be somewhat less than useful.  So I think it's a useful reference-if perhaps not for the reasons the author intended.  Have your office buy it for you.  I would not spend my own money on this.
