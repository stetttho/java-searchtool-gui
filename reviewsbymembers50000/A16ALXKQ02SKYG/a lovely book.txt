 These five stories are told with the shimmering grace and ephemeral colors A.S. Byatt readers have come to expect.  And as such, these five realistic fairy tales for adults will surely not disappoint.  But these tales are, in some way, something more.  Written in different times and for different reasons, they nonetheless "hang together" almost as one whole fairy tale about love, dream, story-telling and the many different ways we have of being free.  Free to live our own lives, comfortable with themselves, their worlds, and their selves.  Free to know we are, indeed, quite special after all.  I highly recommend this book.
