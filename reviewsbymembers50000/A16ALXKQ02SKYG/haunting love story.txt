 This is a love story, a story about growing up, a story about discovering one's three rich heritages (Italian and Jewish and literary).  And it is a story about a boy becoming a writer.   There must be thousands such coming-of-age stories; thousands of stories about that first (and naturally unrequited) love; and, since most of the people who write these stories are authors there are even a few tales of how boys grow up to become writers.   And yet this tale is haunting.  It grips the reader and never lets him go till the end and even long after.  And that is because this is also a story about a murder. The murder is barely mentioned.  Oh, the narrator invokes it once or twice when for example he tells us that when he looked out at his family members during a Passover meal "most of whom, a few years later would be swallowed up by German crematory ovens" he found almost all of them terribly bland and bourgeois.  He also mentions it at the beginning when he informs us that his first (unrequited) love, Micol, her father, her mother, and her Grandmother were all "deported to Germany in the autumn of `43".  But that's not what this story is about. This is not a story about concentration camps and the mechanized degradation there.  This is a hauntingly, heart-breakingly beautiful story about a young man and a first love in a wondrous garden.  A story that comes to an abrupt end because the children (the real flowers in the Garden of the Finzi-Continis) are made to pay the ultimate price because the Italians around them first resented that "the Jews were not enough like the others and then, having ascertained their almost total assimilation into their surroundings, [resented] the opposite: that they were just like the others."   It is, in the end (to paraphrase Amos Oz), about Jews who were not to be special and who were not to be banal; who were not to be.
