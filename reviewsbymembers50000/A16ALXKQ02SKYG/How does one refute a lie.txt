 This is a commentary on our age as much as it is a series of essays about the people Vidal-Naquet calls assassins of memory.  And a sad commentary it is.  For it features some of our greatest minds and some of our most revered institutions. Here is Chomsky, proudly proclaiming that "It is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the truth and expose lies"... shortly before penning a preface to Robert Faurisson's book--a book that denied the Holocaust. (Chomsky later realized what he had done and frantically called the publisher to omit his preface). Here is an institute that finances revisionis activities offering $50,000 to anyone who could prove the existence of a gas chamber.  A gentleman who had seen his entire family murdered accepted only to find that the conditions of "proof" were set so high that only a person who HAD been gassed could, in fact, prove the existence of a gas chamber. Here is Jean-Paul Sartre's report on genocide--a report which omits the Armenian genocide so as not to offend the Pakistani and Turkish authorities. Here is the origin of the book's title for those who would deny the Holocaust, "chose their target well: they are intent at striking a community in the thousand painful fibers that continue to link itself to its own past." Here is the French Court struggling with the concept of "crimes against humanity" on December 20, 1985. And here is the state of the French libraries.  "Neither at the Sorbonne nor at the Bibliotheque Nationale can one find fundamental documentation concerning Auschwitz, which has to be consulted, for the most part, at the Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaire, which itself is far from possessing all that it should."   It seems Vidal-Naquet is amply justified in concluding "Will the truth have the last word?  How one would like to be sure of it....."
