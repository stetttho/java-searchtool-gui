 I don't know if George Orwell is the best writer this century has produced, but he is among the most decent human beings who was also an extremely talented writer.  And that decency, that honesty and sense of fair play come through loud and clear through this wonderful mix of editorial pieces and personal letters.  It does not matter whether he is writing about the Socialist movement, the Monarchy, the manner in which Americans were treated in England during WWII, the English language, writing, colonialism, nationalism, anti-Semitism, or how to make a proper cup of tea, his honesty is ever-present.  For he wrote these essays (I think) because although "emotional urges which are inescapable, and are perhaps even necessary to political action, [they] should be able to exist side-by-side with reality.  But this requires a moral effort."  If you are prepared to make such a moral effort-or simply want to spend a few nights with a truly wonderful human being and gifted writer, I highly recommend this book.
