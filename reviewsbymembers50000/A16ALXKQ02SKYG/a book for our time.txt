 Raymond Aron wrote this brilliant book as a devastating attack on intellectuals who were then much taken with communism, revolution and the proletariat.  But it has, as he recognized, obvious relevance to the intellectual climate in the post Cold War world. Consider, for example, this his profound insight that the intellectual "protests against police brutality, the inhuman rhythm of industrial production, the severity of bourgeois courts, the execution of prisoners whose guilt has not been proved beyond doubt.... But as soon as he decides to give his allegiance to a party which is implacably hostile as he is himself to the established order, we find him forgiving.. everything he has hitherto relentlessly denounced.  The revolutionary myth bridges the gap between moral intransigence and terrorism." Hence today's intellectuals no longer defend Stalin; they applaud Arafat.  They do not question whether Western democratic values are superior to those of the USSR but whether Western values are superior to those of Mid-East and Africa.  It is no longer fashionable to question whether the way we see communist countries is culturally apt; instead we question whether how we see terrorists is culturally apt.  After all, should we not look for "root causes" of terrorism?  That question is still asked.  It's just that before 1989 intellectuals asked that question about communist terrorism; today they ask it about Mid-East terrorism. The myth of the revolution has moved to a new continent and intellectuals, the Revolution's devotees, have a new Pope.   What a difference a few years make!
