 This book equates war-privations with the systematic murder of 6 million children, women, and men.  It does not prove any of its allegations for the simple reason that they have been Disproved --in at least one case in a New York Court of Law (a detail this book omits). It never mentions any of the conclusions reached in any of the inquiries held (in different countries) about many of the incidents it portrays here. Nor, does it even mention what Palestinians say about all this.  It does not, for example, mention the plight of Palestinians like Raja Shehadeh who are marked men because they truly want peace. But that is not surprising--for in this book purportedly about the Palestinians the Palestinian voice is remarkably absent.  The Palestinians are never asked and their esponses are never recorded.  We know what the authors think the Palestinians' plight is; we do not, however, have any idea what the Palestinians themselves think. For those truly interested in what is happening in the Territories from a Palestinian perspective, I would highly recommend Strangers in the House: Coming of Age in Occupied Palestine instead. by Raja Shehadeh, Anthony Lewis
