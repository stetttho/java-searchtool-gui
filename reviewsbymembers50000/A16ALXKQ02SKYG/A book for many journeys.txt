 In this collection of wonderfully sardonic essays Umberto Eco demonstrates the qualities that have made his a great novelist: attention to detail, to people, and his erudition.  And to the delight of many-he displays yet another (perhaps unexpected) quality: a wicked yet welcoming wit.    For these essays about many different journeys are welcoming because they are so recognizable.  There is the journey (without) a watch; the journey of a child eating ice cream; the (very literal) airplane journey with attendant gadget advertising; the journeys of modern communication via a fax machine-and many, many more.    These essays drew me into an incredible world, made me laugh and grimace at the same time.  But above all, they forced me to recognize my world--and myself.  This is a good book to take with you on a journey-no matter where you are headed.  I recommend it.
