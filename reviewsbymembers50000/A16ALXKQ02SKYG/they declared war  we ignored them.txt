 This is the personal story of a man who joined the CIA to "get a slice of the truth not available to everyone" and who travels to many hearts of darkness in search of that truth.  This tells us of the friends and foes he makes in his quest; of the Kurds he befriends in Iraq-the ones who nearly overthrew Saddam but stopped their operation because the White House could not "remember to care" whether Saddam was in power or not-and the enemies he makes.  Perhaps most notable of the last is Sheila Heslin, a prominent DC lawyer who represented Caspian oil in the Clinton Administration. It is also the story of a quest that almost became an obsession: Robert Baer's determination to find out who was behind the bombing of the US embassy in Beirut in 1983.  He discovered his answer 15 years later: Yassir Arafat's Fatah bombed the US embassy on Iran's orders.  At the same time Robert Baer discovered that Usama bin Laden had made an alliance with Iran and with Egyptian fundamentalists-the latter most likely with ties to Arafat. And last of all it is the story of an organization.  An organization that goes from being a serious spy agency to one that is so politically correct and so politicized at every level that when Robert Baer suggested sending someone to interview fleeing Afghanis, the central CIA office recommended giving them sexual harassment training instead.  For the "mantra at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue seemed to be: Get through the term.  Keep the bad news from the newspapers.  Dump the naysayers.  Gather money for the next election-globs and globs of it-and let some other administration down the line deal with it.  Worst of all, the CIA had decided to go along for the ride." And as a result, when the terrorists in Iran, PLO, and Saudi Arabia declared war on the US and the West, we decided to ignore them.  With what results, we all know.
