 In this book, Phyllis Chesler shows us that what too many call new anti-Zionism or legitimate criticism of Israel is really nothing other than good, old-fashioned anti-Semitism of the worst kind.  Jews are murdered, cut up, their murderers dip their hands in their victims? blood and the media says nothing, nothing at all. A writer of Phyllis Chesler?s stature, a woman who virtually created a strand of feminism, writes a book sympathetic to Jews and to Israel and she is shunned by her colleagues; dis-invited to lectures; her books no longer sell.  All this because she, a woman who learned her feminism while married to an Afghani in Afghanistan wrote a book on anti-Semitism.  Because she broke a taboo. These are chilling examples.  But perhaps the most troubling (to me at least) chapter in this brilliant book was entitled ?Modern Anti-Semitism before 9/11?.  Most of this chapter is a list really.  Part of it for, example reads ?On September 5, 1995, a terrorist broke into Daniel Frei?s house in Ma?aleh Michmash.  He was only 28 years old?. On November 13, 2000, two bombs exploded ?. On January 22, 2002? Danny Pearl?.?  This chapter is 47 pages long.  It covers terrorist attacks against Jews from 1920s till September 2001.  These atrocities took place all over the world.  And no-one said anything. Why?  Because these attacks on Jews were not called pogroms; they were called attacks on Zionists. They were and are the new anti-Semitism.  And the world?s reaction is the old silence and consent.
