 At one level this is an historical novel that charts the course of a courageous woman's life.  A woman who did much to save the Jews being persecuted by the various Inquisitions by, among other things, purchasing Safed to be a haven for Jews.  But that is not what this book is "about."  For the question it seeks to answer is a very modern one.  This book tries to tell us why we should bother being Jewish, Sephardic, or anything at all; why being "just human" is not enough.   And as the story weaves in and out of romance, history, and all-too-familiar contemporary issues of feminism vs. family vs. career, we gradually come to realize, that it is worth being "a someone ethnic" because only by being Jewish, Sephardic, or any other culture can we "learn from the good that was part of your history, that which ennobled and raised your people even higher."  We learn not "to insist that we were born rootless because the past can't be overcome." Nor should it be overcome.  For in this world of "jeans and Rollerblades and bad T-shirts and Walkmans... there is no danger in our differences; but in the overwhelming tedium of the ... sameness that is drowning out what each of us has learned, what each of us can contribute." So in the end this beautifully-written historical romance asks (begs, really) all of us, whatever our culture or ethnicity to hold on to our rich heritage and thereby stop what many sociologists have called the McDonaldization of our world.
