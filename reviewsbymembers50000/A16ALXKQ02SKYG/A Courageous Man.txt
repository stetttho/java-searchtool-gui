 Shehadeh's book is perhaps the only one to lay out the multi-faceted nature of the Israeli-Palestinian-Arab conflict.  Or, as Shehadeh, puts it so eloquently a conflict between Palestinians, Israelis, the "inside" and the "outside". For me, the most touching moment of the book came when the young Shehadeh heard the PLO radio denounce his father for daring to work for a two-state solution.  "A.S.," it declared, "you are a traitor, a despicable collaborator.  You want to surrender and sell your birthright.  We know how to deal with the likes of you.  A. S. you shall pay for your treason.  We shall eliminate you.  Silence you forever.  Traitor.  Collaborator.  Quisling." The PLO quite simply could not afford to lose the funding it received from the surrounding Arab states to create a peaceful future for Israelis and Palestinians and also to ensure that Israel would no longer "be the subject of fiery speeches in which the people's rage could be articulated and released-they would be distracted from dealing with all that was wrong at home."   The PLO simply could not afford peace because it wasn't being paid to bring about either peace or an independent Palestinian State; it was being paid to keep the Palestinians miserable and angry.  To ensure that the Palestinian plight remained a distraction for the Arabs earning for democracy. Shehadeh's father dared to stand up to the PLO and its backers.  He was murdered.   And now, his son is carrying on his father's work.   It is our job to make sure that Raja's life lasts longer than his father's.
