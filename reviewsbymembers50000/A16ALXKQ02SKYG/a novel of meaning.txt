 Culture Geerts tells us consists of "webs of significance" that man shares with others snared in those same webs.  And in Mr. Sammler's Planet, Bellow shows us that this is indeed the case.  For he shows us what happens to a people after the bearers of the significance are destroyed and only the remnants of webs, fluttering meaninglessly are left.  For this is a story of post-Holocaust.  It is a tale of a man whose life flashes before his eyes as the last man who is able to share his meaning lies dying.  Mr. Sammler "originated in... another time" and he recognizes the traces of that time, that clture in his relatives.  And Sammler sees traces of that time and culture in Bruch's fetishism; sees it every time Wallace asks Sammler if "he has the exact words"; hears it in Feffer's voice whose "undertones appeal really for help"; sees it in his own fascination with the Black man and his latent racism.  For certainly his time and his culture were not ideal, or as he himself says "the original Cracow Sammler was never especially kind."  But the tragedy of this story lies in the fact that only Sammler sees the traces of that once-vibrant culture in his Jewish relatives.  Sammler and Elya.  And Elya is dying.  And Sammler's relatives-they feel alienated from their own (brutally destroyed) past, and, as a result, give themselves up to a world that seeks to rearrange and orchestrate its own disorders and thus give the illusion of meaning.  And so they become mad and want nothing more than to escape to the omnipresent moon.  To start over.  And Mr. Sammler sees all this and as his friend, his friend; his nephew dies slowly he begins to talk.  He begins to share with the orphans around him what they had been begging from him all these years-he begins to tell them from whence they came.  For as the only man who had ever understood him dies Mr. Samler understands that must meet the terms of his contract; he must to try to help bring back some meaning.
