 Mr Finkelstein is so obsessed with vilifying Zionism (which he compares to Nazism) that he never even tries to discover what Zionism is. Zionism is a movement of national liberation and has all the attributes of such a movement. Had Mr. Finkelstein paused to consider this, he might have realized that Zionism may be clashing with another movement of national liberation.  If he had done so, his book might have been at the least honest. As it is, he is so busy vilifying Zionism and praising everything and anything opposed to this evil straw man he has set up in his mind, that he is simply incapable of writing a scholarly work on this conflict. A pity because he is obviously a gifted writer.
