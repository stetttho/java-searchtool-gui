 Judy Lash Balint leaves nothing unsaid.  Her diary tells us everything Judy Lash Belint sees just by living in Jerusalem: from the daily terrorist attacks to the water being turned off when she gets back from yet another grueling day of work (in Jerusalem water is rationed and every apartment complex votes on when they will have no water but Judy Lash Balint was not there for the meeting and so did not vote and did not know...) and yet being so tired, no exhausted that never mind she can collapse and sleep without water or a bath or a drink. And from her we hear what it is like to visit a family right after a horror attack.  Vadim was murdered and a Palestinian soaked his hands in his blood and held them up for the cameras of the world to see.  Irina his pregnant wife was watching television and saw it all on TV... and when Judy Lash Belint pays a condolence call and Irina says nothing because what is there to say? And Judy Lash Belint tells us also of the Ethiopian Jews' custom of going up to the Western Wall to celebrate their gratitude for the Torah and she tells us of drinking coffee in a Starbucks and of the regular election debates. The ordinary and the recognizable intermingle freely in these pages with the horrible and the incredible.  It is a book all those who are interested in Israel should read because it tells of one woman's experiences in Israel, in Jerusalem; day by day.
