 I first read Absalom, Absalom! in a class on women's writing and feminist interpretation.  The instructor assured us that this book was "all about" Faulkner's fear of and jealousy of women or more specifically of our reproductive power.  Even though I was very much a feminist at the time (hence the class in the first place) I admit, this interpretation ruined the book for me. In fact, I never finished this book while at college and only read enough to get an "A" on the term paper and exam.  It wasn't until very recently that a good friend of mine finally succeeded in convincing me to give Faulkner another chance.  I did and this review is a kind of thank you to that friend. For Absalom, Absalom! is an incredible work.  For those of you who want to know "what it's all about," the plot is fairly simple: a poor boy goes to the West Indies to make his fortune, meets a woman there, marries her, finds out she is part Black, repudiates her and his child, gets another (White) wife and family.  Eventually his son by his first wife meets his second son, the two come home and his first son falls in love with his half-sister.  And the younger brother kills the older brother before the latter can marry their sister. That's it. That's the "what happened" plot but the real "plot" is in the "why happened" not the "what happened".  This book takes us on a breathless journey to the depths of the human heart (a heart corrupted by an immutable caste system) and lifts us up again on a rollercoaster ride that is a bit hard to take sometimes.  It is about the way people think and react; about the way (and the why) they love and whether they acknowledge that love (or not) and what happens as a result. It is about the choices we make once but that happen over and over as though those choices are not and can never be made only once.  And no doubt Faulkner's fear of women is in here too. It's just that this time I didn't see it as much; or perhaps it wasn't the only thing I saw.
