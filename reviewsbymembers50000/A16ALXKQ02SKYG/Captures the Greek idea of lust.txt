 The acting in this movie (I did not get the chance to watch the miniseries) ranges from the very believable (Menelaus, Priam) to the ridiculous (Helen).  And, of course, anyone who is looking for a faithful reproduction of the Iliad need look elsewhere. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this movie because (despite the ending which was obviously meant to appeal to our own, modern age) Helen of Troy captures the Greek concept of love and lust better than I have yet seen done in any other production. The Greeks did not think that sexual passion was a harmless passtime.  To them sexual passion was a destructive natural force that, if indulged in to excess, could destroy worlds.  In this case, it destroyed Troy and all but destroyed Mycenea. And that is why all feel dishonored in the end; for the ability to control one's appetite is the sign of a truly virtuous man--and none of the men in this movie can be so described.
