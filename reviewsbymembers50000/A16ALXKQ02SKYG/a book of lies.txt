 Contrary to what the book would have us believe preventing civilian casualties was of the utmost importance to the Israeli Defense Forces.  For example, Israeli soldiers carefully guarded a Palestinian hospital's water and oxygen supply and blew up nothing that might endanger the hospital despite the fact that it served as a refuge for several wanted fugitives. The man who claimed that the IDF somehow endangered the hospital was in fact being treated in a hospital while the Jenin operation was occurring.  The hospital was in Afulla and it is an Israeli hospital.   One of them men interviwed for this book, Abu Riali, was also interviewed by al Jazeera television.  It was there that he made up his story about "thousands of victims" (a story the UN later proved to be completely false).   The book talks about a child who died when Israeli tanks flattened a Palestinian house.  This never happened.  The footage that "proves" this was doctored.  The man who produced this footage, Muhammed Bakri, has admitted to doctoring the footage.
