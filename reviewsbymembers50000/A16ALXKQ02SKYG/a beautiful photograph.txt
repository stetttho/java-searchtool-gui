 Reading this book was for me like looking at a family album while my host (whose album this is) tells me about the photographs quietly, gently, his sad eyes fixed on the back of my head.  And as I looked I realized that the photographs (the still lives captured on this page and that) are photos of photos of photos; that behind them simmer reflections of things not in the image itself; that they are photos of the same scene but taken with many cameras, seen with many eyes; and slowly, gradually I realize that I am in the photographs also-a kind of ghost guided inside by my host-and I step in and look around.  Until finally, I come to the last photograph in the album (not the last photograph; just the last photograph in that particular album) and I look at it, at its grey rain, at its sadness and I don't close the album.  That is what reading this incredible book is like-and that is why I heartily recommend it to anyone who ever hesitated to speak of himself, his family, his heart.
