 I wonder if Mr. Hoffman would disagree with the following statement: "You ought to realize that there are some things which the human mind has in its power to grasp, others which it cannot grasp by any means whatever, subjects which are closed to it; and there are others still which the mind knows in one state but not others."  Or how about "Where two claimants are holding on to one object (or have possession of one animal) and each claims ownership of the whole object, each of the claimants must take an oath that he has a valid claim to ownership of the object he is claiming, and that he is entitled to no less than half of it.  The claimants then divide the object, or its value, equally between them."   Probably not.  After all, the first quote is from Rambam: Readings in the philosophy of Moses Maimonedes and the second from The Talmud: The Steinsaltz Edition, Volume I, Tractate Bava Metzia, Part I and it is Hoffman's intent to "debunk" both. I must therefore assume that he believes for example that the human mind knows all (no matter that the New Testament says otherwise) and that the best way to settle disputes is for the claimants to kill each other (and who cares about the Sermon of the Mount).  He therefore debases much that is good and noble in Christianity in his "cause". It is a pity so many believe him.
