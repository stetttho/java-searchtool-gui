 Honestly, this updated Platinum edition offers everything you could ever dream of in a first person "shooter" game. In the edition, you'll get Half-Life, Opposing Force, Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, and Blue Shift. All games are more than worthy of being called classics in their own time.  And more specifically, Half-Life, OpFor, and Blue Shift allow you to play individually. Now, what truly pushes this over the top is the ability to get ONLINE and fight with other human opponents!  The online community is thriving. Counter-Strike, Half-Life, Team Fortress, and Opposing Force all allow online play or no sign-up/monthly fees.  It's all FREE.  There are nearly 1000 Half-Life servers and nearly 30,000 Counter-Strike servers world-wide!!! As a lover of DOOM, Descent, and Duke Nukem 3D, I thought I had played all the best first-person shooter games (as of 1998). Then I played Half-Life!  Since Half-Life 2 has not yet been released this still remains the BEST online Multiplayer First Person Shooter on the market today. With an NVidia GForce2 and a 1GHz PIII, I am getting between 60-99 FPS (frames per second). The graphics are excellent and the play is smooth. One warning though with this game: ONCE YOU PLAY IT ONLINE, YOU WILL NEVER EVER HAVE ENOUGH TIME IN YOUR LIFE TO PLAY THIS GAME. It is truly awesome and the Half-Life community is a welcoming one...as well as challenging.  The Mod community is thriving as well...there are truly a multitude of Mods. Simply put: BUY THIS GAME!!!  GET CONNECTED!!! THEN PLAY UNTIL YOUR EYEBALLS ROLL BACK IN YOUR HEAD OR YOUR FINGERS FALL OFF. You will never be sorry for buying this product.  I have been playing this game online, every month for nearly 3 years...I have tried other games, but none compared to this one.
