 Honestly, this Platinum edition offers everything you could want in a first person "shooter" game. In the package, you get Half-Life, Opposing Force, Team Fortress, and Counter Strike.  All games are more than worthy of being called classics in their own time. HOWEVER, what truly pushes this over the top is the ability to get ONLINE and fight with other human opponents. As a lover of DOOM, Descent, and Duke Nukem 3D, I thought I had played all the best first-person shooter games (as of 1998).  Then I played Half-Life! With an NVidia GForce2, I am getting between 60-99 FPS (frames per second).  The graphics are excellent and the play is smooth. One warning though with this game: ONCE YOU PLAY IT ONLINE, YOU WILL NEVER EVER HAVE ENOUGH TIME IN YOUR LIFE TO PLAY THIS GAME.  It is truly awesome and the Half-Life community is a welcoming one...as well as challenging. Simply put: BUY THIS GAME...GET CONNECTED...AND PLAY UNTIL YOUR EYEBALLS ROLL BACK IN YOUR HEAD.
