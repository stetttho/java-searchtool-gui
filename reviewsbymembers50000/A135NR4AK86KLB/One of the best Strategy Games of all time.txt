 So, you just read my title line... Am I stretching the truth? No. I have played this game for YEARS. I first began to play it in 1996. First thing to note: if you have Civilization 2, the major upgrade here is the ability to play over a network (which works pretty darn well). Second: this pack also includes some quite impressive scenarios.  To be honest, I was surprised at the Viking scenario, it was truly different from the standard Civ2 game. Overall, the beauty of this game is that is is deep, yet easy to learn. It is fun, but not "arcade-like". There is strategy, but it is tempered with action. You can be: diplomatic or iron-fisted, peaceful or war-like, science oriented or a land-grabber or even a money grubber. This game has nearly every facet of enjoyment that you could hope for. The most amazing thing is that you can learn something new nearly everytime you play. The key features to the game are as follows: Build Cities and Improvements (like aqueducts, etc) Build Wonders of the World (which give you special traits) Build Armies Establish trade routes Conquer Enemies Ally with friends Expand your population and finally... Build and send a space ship to Alpha Centauri Simply put, this game is stunning. You will lose many good hours of your life into it...and never feel an iota of guilt or regret. This game works well on all PCs from a Pentium 90 and up, so if your machine is older, no worries. This is unquestionably the best strategy game I have ever played.
