 About 1 month ago, I purchased this product.  I dragged it home, hooked it up, made a call to ATTBI...lo and behold it was running in about 10 minutes.  All they needed to do was register the MAC address and re-set-up the account. I am running 2 computers (via a Linksys router) through it and I have had no issues. I saw an earlier review which said ATTBI did not support this product.  That is true, to an extent.  They will not help you with the modem itself, but they do set up the MAC address to get it to work. One odd thing that did happen though.  For some reason, my account was listed as suspended the next day.  However, that was quickly resolved with one phone-call. Overall, I would highly recommend this product.  It was easy to install, works great, AND it has a nice small footprint (takes up little space on the desk).
