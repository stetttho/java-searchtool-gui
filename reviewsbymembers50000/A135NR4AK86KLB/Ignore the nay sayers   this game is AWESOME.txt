 Test of time was simply an edition of Civ2 that could have been released to current owners as an upgrade.  HOWEVER, if you do not already own the game it is WONDERFUL.  It really has some kick butt upgrades to a nearly-perfect game. I have played Civilization games for nearly 8 years now.  I first began to play in 1996, and have continued on with the latest versions ever since. First note: if you have Civilization 2, the major upgrade here is the ability to play against other humans AND an alien race. Second: this pack also includes some quite impressive scenarios and fantasy settings.  Which force us "old-hands" to go back and learn some new tricks. Third: with the trip to Alpha Centauri, you are granted MORE units.  Units are expanded drastically.  This is an AWESOME addition to the originial game. Overall, the beauty of this game is that is is deep, yet easy to learn. It is fun, but not "arcade-like". There is strategy, but it is tempered with action. You can be: diplomatic or iron-fisted, peaceful or war-like, science oriented or a land-grabber or even a money grubber. This game has nearly every facet of enjoyment that you could hope for. The most amazing thing is that you learn something new almost everytime you play. The key features to the game are as follows: 1) Build Cities and Improvements (like aqueducts, etc) 2) Build Wonders of the World (which give you special traits) 3) Establish trade routes 4) Conquer Enemies 5) Ally with friends (or those you might betray!) 6) Expand your population 7) Build and send a space ship to Alpha Centauri 8) Once on Alpha Centauri, you build a NEW civilization. Simply put, this game is stunning. You will lose many good hours of your life into it...and never feel an iota of guilt or regret. This game works well on all PCs from a Pentium 90 and up, so if your machine is older, no worries. This is unquestionably the best strategy game I have ever played.
