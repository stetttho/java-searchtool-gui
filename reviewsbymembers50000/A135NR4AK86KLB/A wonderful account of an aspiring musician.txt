 First: I am a HUGE Billy Bragg fan and have been since about 1990. Second: This book was excellent. The book really gives a great background on Billy's growing up, his influences, and his rise to "fame".  It is great to see even the simple insights into his music, like the girl from "The Saturday Boy"...and how she approached him after all those years.  Of course, he did not remember her, but that makes it all that much more ironic and colorful. The book itself was clearly written, well-organized, and most importantly it finally gave us fans a great look into Billy's life and music. Summary: ALL fans of Billy's should buy this book.
