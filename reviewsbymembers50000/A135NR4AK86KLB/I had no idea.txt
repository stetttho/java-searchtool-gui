 I truly had no idea the extent of what the US faced off of its shores.  Hickam's account is eye-opening to say the least. Before I read this book I had little-to-no interest in U-Boats or the struggle the found themselves engaged in.  Hickam, pulled me in, kept me up late, and made me buy more books on U-Boats. A great book overall.
