 I was not sure what to expect when I received this book for Christmas.  I had heard that there was an unfinished book and this was it. Well, this is what to expect: 1) A collection of letters, writings, and speeches from Adams.  Some quite old, some more recent. 2) Some selected interviews 3) Less than one-half of what would have been the next Dirk Gently novel This book allows the reader (most likely Adams fans) to see the many facets of Adams' personality.  You truly get a feel for how he thinks and what he truly was like as a human being.  There is much more depth of Adams' character to be found in this book than anything else I have ever read about him.  Even his website could not quite capture this feel.  The editor did a simply marvellous job capturing Douglas' personality, character, and love for life. Two pure gems in the book would have to be: 1) His essay on the two neighboring dogs Maggie and Trudie.  He met them while writing in New Mexico.  Being a dog lover and owner, it was terrible interesting to see dogs through his eyes.  It really gave me a feeling of how he viewed the world. 2) A short skit he wrote with Graham Chapman called The Private Life of Genghis Khan.  (on the Douglas Adams website)  I absolutely loved it.  It actually introduced a character we meet in the Hitchhiker's series. When I finished reading I can say that I felt almost melancholy knowing he had passed and would not be around to finish his work, or produce even more.  The thought is saddening.  However, up until the point that you close the book, you will laugh.  You will laugh long and hard.  You may even re-examine yourself, your life, and your surroundings. This book despite its incomplete ending is absolutely the most fitting tribute to such a gifted and wonderful human being.  In fact, the incompleteness almost adds to the tribute.  DNA may be gone, but he will continue to influence us until we move on as well. As always, the answer remains 42...
