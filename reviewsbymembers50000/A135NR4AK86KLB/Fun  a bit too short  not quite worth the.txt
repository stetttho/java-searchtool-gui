 Buying Blue Shift forces one to make a choice: Do I care enough about the story line of Half-Life to shell out a few bucks for a continuation? The game itself is good.  It is not an improvement of the previous versions (Half-Life, Opposing Force, etc).  HOWEVER, it IS a continuation of the story.  There are some cute/cool tie-ins from the previous games (like when you see Gordon jumping through the portal to Xen). There is also the High Definition pack which improves the graphics-look/feel of the weapons. However, one note of warning: if you play Half-Life in DeathMatches, the HD pack makes it difficult to use the crosshairs...  Why?  Well, for instance, the tip of the M-16 covers up the crosshairs somewhat when it fires.  In the game, this is not an issue, but in HL-DM it can be problemtatic.  The solution to this is to change crosshairs to more visible ones...but I digress. Basically, the game is nice from a story continuity standpoint, but if you don't care about the "Gordon" story, then it is probably not worth buying.
