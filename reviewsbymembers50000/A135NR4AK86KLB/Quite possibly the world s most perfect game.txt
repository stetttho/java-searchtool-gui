 So, you just read my title line... Am I stetching the truth?  No. I have played this game for YEARS.  I first began to play it in 1996. The beauty of this game is that is is deep, yet easy to learn.  It is fun, but not "arcade-like".  There is strategy, but it is tempered with action. You can be: diplomatic or iron-fisted, peaceful or war-like, science oriented or a land-grabber or even a money grubber. This game has nearly every facet of enjoyment that you could hope for.  The most amazing thing is that you can learn something new nearly everytime you play. The key features to the game are as follows: Build Cities and Improvements (like aqueducts, etc) Build Wonders of the World (which give you special traits) Build Armys Establish trade routes Conquer Enemies Ally with friends Expand your population and finally... Build and send a space ship to Alpha Centauri Simply put, this game is stunning.  You will lose many good hours of your life into it...and never feel an iota of guilt or regret. This game works well on all PCs from a Pentium 90 and up, so if your machince is older, no worries. This is unquestionably the best game I have ever played. I realize Civ3 is out now and that game may be better (I have heard great things), but (for the price) you cannot do better than this game.
