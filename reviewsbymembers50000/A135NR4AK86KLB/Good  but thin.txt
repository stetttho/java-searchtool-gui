 First: I am a big fan of Military History.  I love first-hand accounts, books that relive strategies/tactics/lives. This book was good, but it was missing something...  First hand descriptions of what actually was going on. Borovik references a great deal of events, but never delves into them.  This comes about primarily because the book is a collection of articles about the Soviet-Afghan experience.  Mainly though, it was a depressing half-hearted diatribe against Soviet authorities who drove the war effort. Being a student of Soviet Studies, it was clear to me that the style was quintessentially Russian.  Meaning, it talked about hardships, was vivid in visual details, and rich in melancholia.  However, it lacked details on what really happened there, how troops conducted themselves, what the Afghans were like, and how the war was waged. Frankly, the book left me a bit cold.  However, if you are looking for a book that gives the somber nature of the Soviet feelings towards the Afghan war, this is a decent book to read.
