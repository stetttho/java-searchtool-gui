 This movie has become one of my favorite movies of all time. The story is as follows: Peter Reigert (Mac) is a fast-dealing/smooth talking Texas oil-man who is asked to go close a deal in Scotland.  He must buy the town so the whole bay can be turned into a refinery. In a not-so-unexpected twist, the town is not as naiive as the Texans would hope.  More importantly, things are not as easy as a simple payout.  A lone hermit who lives on, and owns, the beach stands in the way. What makes this movie truly wonderful, is that the story of the purchase, is merely secondary to the story of how Mac falls in love with the town.  He falls in love with the real...and the not so real.  Meaning, he falls in love with the romantic vision of this small fishing town. In many ways, this movie reminds me of Brigadoon. Mac "discovers" a town, away from the hustle/bustle of his life.  It literally "appears" to him out of the fog (which he encounters on the drive there).  And, in the end, if his plan works...it will disappear. The music is beautiful (done by Marc Knopfler).  The scenery stunning (shot on both the west and east coasts of Scotland).  The acting excellent.  And most importantly, the story is charming and heart-warming...yet leans towards the melancholy. I could not recommend a movie more.
