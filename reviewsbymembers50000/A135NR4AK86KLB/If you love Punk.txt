 You will love this album.  The Toy Dolls are one o the more amusing, creative, and crazy punk bands around.  The lead singer has always sounded like he overdosed on helium...hard to believe, I know. I have been listening to these guys for over a decade now, and I never get tired of them. This album is worth the money just for the song: "I'M Gonna Be 500 Miles"
