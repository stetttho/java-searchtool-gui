 ...but I love this router.  It was easy to set up.  I have had my cable modem company let my service get fouled up a few times, thus causing the router to need to be reset.  The instructions were MORE THAN ENOUGH for a new person like me to be able to reset the router. I have two computers networked into it and have had no issues for over 9 months. For those of you who are NOT "geeks" this router is for you.  I have had nothing but a GOOD experience with this product.
