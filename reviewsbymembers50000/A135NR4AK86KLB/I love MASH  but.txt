 This is a great boxed set to buy for any MASH fan.  It is truly wrapped up well and a great addition to anyone's DVD collection. While I love the series and I was happy to have these, I would like to see at least some kind of basic special items, etc.  Behind the scenes...something.  But alas, there are only the episodes. The one EXTRA would be listening to the episode in French or Spanish...that has been fun...the dubbing cracks me up. Overall, this set is worth the money and all MASH fans should buy this set.
