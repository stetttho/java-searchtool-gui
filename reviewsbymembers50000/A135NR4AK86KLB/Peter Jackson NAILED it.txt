 Before the movie, I re-read the book.  Peter Jackson simply nailed it.  He was able to make the book come alive without compromising anything.  The movie was truly AMAZING.  Battle scenes were brought to life in such vivid detail and yet so true to the book, I was stunned. Anyone who reads the book also appreciates the importance of maintaining dialogue from the books.  Jackson's attention to detail and ability to capture the appropriate mood of each scene cannot be understated. Truly an impressive work. For fans of the movie itself, there are some wonderful extra features that should not be missed.
