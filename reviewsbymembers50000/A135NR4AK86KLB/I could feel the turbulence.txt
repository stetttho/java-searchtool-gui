 Gerald Astor has a gift.  Period. His ability to make the reader FEEL what it was like to be in a B-17, under fire, cold, and far from home...is simply amazing. I have never read an account of the air war that made me truly understand what it must have been like to actually be there. While Astor managed to stick to facts and figures.  He also managed to bring to life the very experience of flying over Germany. His ability to describe and bring a story to life surpasses Ambrose...without a doubt.  (and I am an enormous fan of Ambrose)
