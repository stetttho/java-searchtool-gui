 Simply put: I laughed. I laughed long and hard. So much so, my wife was being driven nuts. Whether you are a fan of the Evil Dead Series, Brisco County Jr, or if you are asking yourself "Who hte heck is this guy?" YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK. This was one of the more creatively written books I have picked up in a long time. The stories are priceless, descriptions are hillarious, and I actually learned something about the acting profession. I could not recommend this book more highly. However, should you have heart troubles or if you are firmly set against enjoying yourself then you should not buy this book. BUT, if you want a light and humorous read, this book is for you.
