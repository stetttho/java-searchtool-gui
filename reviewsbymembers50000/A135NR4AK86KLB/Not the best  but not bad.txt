 First, let me say, I have been a huge fan of Billy's since 1990.  I have attended concerts, bought T-shirts, and played his music full blast on many a day. The album contains a few gems, a few mediocre songs, and a few that are painful to hear.  Being a HUGE fan of the British Isles, I found the song "Take Down the Union Jack" to inspire a bit of melancholy and a bit of acceptance...the Isles have changed. Other songs like "Baby Farouk", "Distant Shore", and "Tears of My Tracks", bring you to remember some of his older albums quite fondly. This album is fairly decent, but is missing something.  Compared to William Bloke this is one notch below.  This album most directly corresponds to Don't Try This at Home... So, if you are a Billy Bragg fan, you should buy this album (if only for Take Down the Union Jack).  If you have never listened to Billy before, then I suggest you go pick up Back to Basics or William Bloke before hand.
