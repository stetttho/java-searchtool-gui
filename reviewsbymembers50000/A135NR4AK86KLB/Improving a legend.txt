 For those who have not played Yahtzee: The goal is simple a player rolls 5 dice (three consecutive times) to develop a "hand" based on poker rules. For instance, three 6's = 18 points or 1,2,3,4,5 = Full Straight. In each attempt you get to choose which dice to keep or put back in the cup for another roll. The wonderful thing about Yahtzee is that even though it is a game of playing the odds, luck plays an enormous part in this game, thus even a new person can destroy an experienced player with just a little luck. For those who have played Yahtzee: You will love this game because it is more than you have ever played before. There is the original game, plus 4 modifications. Yahtzee - the classic version Triple Yahtzee - Essentially 3 cards of Yahtzee on one card, with multipliers (1x, 2x, 3x) Painted Yahtzee - A mix of colors and numbers are used here. Battle Yahtzee - After your rolls, your opponent gets to roll INTO your dice!!! This game has been an absolutely wonderful addition to my collection of games (nearly 100 and counting!).  My wife and I play it whenever we travel...and sometimes just to be able to sit back and be a little competitive. The sounds are excellent, the music is not terribly annoying, and the 5 different types of play keep things fresh, so you don't get burnt out too soon. This is one of the very best values out there, period.
