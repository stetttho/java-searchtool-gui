 Well, this series of DVDs kicks off the 3rd season.  The characters become more rounded out.  The interaction quicker and more witty.  And most importantly, the characters have gelled in the minds of the writers.  In fact, this was the first season that Jamie Farr was offered a full time contract!!!  Before that, he was a "day player" and only made a few appearances. Now, if you are a M*A*S*H fan, this should pose no surprises to you.  You probably already knew this. So, for big fans you are asking yourself, what will I get by buying this? The answer is simple: A concise collection of the 3rd season with each episode in its entirety. For commercial reasons, there always seems to be a little missing from each episode, and these DVDs are able to ensure that the ENTIRE episode is delivered. Now, understand that there are still no behind-the-scenes interviews or "special features", etc.  You will simply get 24 episodes with no interruptions (which is always better than having to watch them with commercials and having a few seconds cut out). So, for you die-hards, I happily recommend this title, it is definitely worth the reasonable price.
