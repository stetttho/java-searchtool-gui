 Sid Meier designed a game EVEN better than Civilization2.  It is hard to imagine that this could be done, but it has!!! This game has everything: Trade Diplomacy Scientific advances War & Peace Exploration Culture Money Space Race EVERYTHING For those who are not familiar with Civ2, I will explain as simply as possible:  The whole idea of the game is to build the BEST CIVILIZATION possible. What does this mean?  MANY THINGS. YOU CAN WIN IN MANY WAYS: 1) Build a Civilization that achieves military dominance...CRUSH THOSE WHO OPPOSE! 2) Build a Civ that overwhelms all over Civs, so they want to be like you...IF YA CAN'T BEAT 'EM, GET THEM TO JOIN YOU! 3) Accumulate points that you are awarded for population, happiness of citizens, and even gaining knowledge.  BE THE BEST YOU CAN BE! 4) Expand.  Just be the BIGGEST Civ and you win by owning 66% of the world's land!  GO WEST/EAST/SOUTH/NORTH YOUNG MAN!!! 5) Be elected UN Secretary General by the players ...PLAY NICE WITH OTHERS!!! 6) Win the Space Race.  FIRST ONE OFF THE PLANET WINS!!! Now, you may ask: Well, how do I do this?  GOOD QUESTION. The answer is simple: Build Cities Have Wars/Declare Peace Trade resources/luxuries Gain Knowledge All of this is done at the macro and micro level.  You can control cities' production of units, improvements, and wonders of the world.  This can also be given to a COMPUTER governor (AI).  This will speed up the game.  But if you love strategy and you love detail and control...YOU CAN DO IT ALL.  NONE of it remains out of your control...if you want. This game is perfect because it allows you to control what you want, and nothing you don't.  The AI is good, the graphics excellent, the concept SUPERB, and the overall game STUNNING. You will want to play this ENDLESSLY.  Strategy, action, tactics...it has it all!!! However, should you buy this game and you listen to my recommendation...DO NOT BLAME ME FOR ALL THE TIME YOU LOSE IN YOUR LIFE... YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME!!!
