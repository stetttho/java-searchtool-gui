 One listen to "This House" or "Ode to Boy" will  convince you that Alison is in a league of her own. In 1994, I had the  pleasure of hearing her perform in a small club and her voice....THAT  VOICE, completely filled the room. I had to close  my eyes a couple of  times just to try to take it all in. The crowd just adored her and she was  very sweet and modest.
