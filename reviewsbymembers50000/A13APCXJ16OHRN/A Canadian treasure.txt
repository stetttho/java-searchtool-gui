 Loreena is a rare treat indeed....her voice, her music, her  style....exquisite. Something very notable: Loreena, unlike many other  musicians of the day, is not afraid to explore and pay tribute  to overt  Christian themes. This album is full of worshipful Christmas carols. Other  song examples from her various C.D.'s include; "Lullaby",  "Dicken's Dublin", "Dark Night Of The Soul". Her  decision to record this kind of music shows deep  respect so often lacking  elsewhere. As a result, Loreena gets my sincere appreciation.
