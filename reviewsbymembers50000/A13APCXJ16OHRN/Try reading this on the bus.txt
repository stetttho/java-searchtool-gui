 I really enjoyed this book and I must admit, it got me thinking about  areas of my life that need extra attention and a lot of prayer. I  especially enjoyed Hewitt's honest appraisal of "New Age" books  and their authors. It is humourous while still maintaining respect for  those mentioned. I found myself thinking throughout the day of several  things I had just earlier read about....I guess that was the whole  point.......!
