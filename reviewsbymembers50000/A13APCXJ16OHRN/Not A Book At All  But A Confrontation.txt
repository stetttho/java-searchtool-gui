 This is a dangerous read for one that may still be avoiding Jesus Christ. The reviewer that stated this book is "philosopically flawed" and that Lewis "over-simplifies" is buying into the same old unspoken  nonsense. Many want a god that can meet them intellectually, which means of  course that the God the simple man worships can't be the one for them. The  Gospel is deliberately simple; Lewis could not over-simplify it......he  could neither add to it nor take away from it. It is because of the  Gospel's simplicity that Jesus is available to all people at all times,  everywhere. God's intellect can be matched by no created being and any  individual that finds salvation through Christ to be of no intellectual  challenge is really revealing this: They value themselves above other  people and in doing so expose the very nature of sin and God's amazing  mercy of sending Christ into the world. A paradox? Of course, and the  narrow road to the Kingdom. Welcome!
