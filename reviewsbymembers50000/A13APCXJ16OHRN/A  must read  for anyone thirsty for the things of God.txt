 Man, I wish someone had told be about this author sooner!! A.W. Tozer was  greatly blessed with the ability to convey the nature of God to those  wanting and willing to hear. He was a very prayerful man and that fact is  certainly evident in this book as well as his many others. In it, I found  what I needed to hear about God and about myself as well. Tozer has never  been popular with liberal Christians and for good reason; he was a man  deeply committed to making God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit known to a  dying world - and he constantly urged believers to get out of the sandbox,  so to speak, about the most important issue in life; obedience to Christ.  This book may just be used by God to keep you up a few nights! Be  forewarned.....once you start reading him, you may not be able to stop!
