 Classic Tozer on tape! Play this in the car and go for a long drive....worth several listens and more. Boy, could this man hammer a point home and you know, he needed too. When finishing a book or tape of his, one is greatly reminded of the urgent message of the Gospel.....and the fact  that we really do need to "count your days like blades of grass".  This was recorded in 1954, but like the Gospel on which it is firmly fixed,  it is absolutely timeless.
