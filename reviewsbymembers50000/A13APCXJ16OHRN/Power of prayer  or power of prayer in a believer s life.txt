 Spurgeon goes straight to the heart of the issue before you even open the  book. He explains to the reader in no uncertain terms what God requires of  His children and what He is willing to bestow upon them for their  obedience. Spurgeon is a timeless writer although at times (most!) he makes  for some very intense reading. I have read other solid books on prayer but  this is the best.
