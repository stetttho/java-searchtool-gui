 Anthony Hobson is so enamored with J.W. Waterhouse that he published a  second book about the artist. If you are a fan, this is very good news!  There are many paintings here that one may never have seen before, but alas  there are also many that are not featured. Nevertheless, this is a  beautiful book to give or to receive. There is also a  "mini-biography" throughout that adds to the enjoyment of this  art book.
