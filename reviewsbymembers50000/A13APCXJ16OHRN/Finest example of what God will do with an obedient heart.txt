 There is good reason why this man endures as the years go past. Christ is  everlasting and will shine as a light in the darkness through a life in  complete submission to Him. This is by no means too strong a statement to  make about Billy Graham and his family. His autobiography makes for some  very fine reading. Enjoy!
