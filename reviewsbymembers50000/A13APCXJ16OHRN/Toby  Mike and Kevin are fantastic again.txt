 Well, the kind lady at the bookstore sold me this C.D. one day before the  release date. Thanks!! (It was probably the look of desperation on my  face......). This recording is definitely different than "Jesus  Freak" and with only one go-round in the C.D. player, I can already  say it's great. The lyrics, as usual, are rock solid in their profession of  Christ; and the guys voices are getting better all the time.
