 The first time I became acquainted with this book, a dear friend (a  pre-believer) picked it out for himself from the bookstore shelf. His life  changed dramatically after reading it. I found it to be an easy but  thought-provoking read - it's become a book I have purchased many times to  pass on to others anxious to know God. The author has a wonderful way of  explaining the nature and attributes of a holy God and the relationship  that He desires to have with each and everyone of us. It also dismantles  the false and lazy belief that we can live our lives fully now and  eternally while ignoring our Creator. Mr. Brown oftens uses quotes by  writers such as C.S. Lewis in a very helpful way. I think of this book as  sort of a "junior" edition of "Mere Christianity" by  C.S. Lewis or "The Attributes of God" by A.W. Tozer. I highly  recommend it!
