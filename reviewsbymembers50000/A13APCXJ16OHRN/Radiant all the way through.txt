 I have had this C.D. for some time and still find it immensely enjoyable.  I do however find it rather amusing that some listeners rush to call the  over-all album "pagan hymns", as did the "music fan from Los  Angeles". He/she musn't have been referring to "How Can I Keep  From Singing"! Granted, this album is by no means a Christian album  and therefore appeals to a wider range of individuals. The Celts have deep  Christian roots and for those wishing to explore this further musically, I  suggest Maire Brennen's "Perfect Time" or Iona's "Journey  Into The Morn". Both of these recordings are available through  Amazon.com.
