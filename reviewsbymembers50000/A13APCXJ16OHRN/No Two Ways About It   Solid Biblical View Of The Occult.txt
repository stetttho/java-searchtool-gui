 Yes, this book is out of print and I found it secondhand. Don't hesitate to buy it should you see it. Written in 1968 but especialy timely 30 years on. There are many "Bishop Pikes" in the world today, fiercely  clinging to their title of bishop while vehemently denying Christ Jesus at  every turn. The case of Bishop Pike is a sad one certainly but not one to  be sympathized with. Unger gives a thorough overview of the Bishop's  beliefs (or rather, lack thereof) and his rapid decline into the occult.  The Word of God regarding the occult is made extremely clear in the closing  chapters of this book.
