 Even after being a Christian for years, I had never bought a christian  recording until I heard "Heaven In The Real World" on the radio.  Steven is very engaging and there are many fine songs on this album. His  imput on "The Apostle" soundtrack with "I Will Not Go  Quietly" is also really impressive. You've got a fan for life, Steven.
