 There is great reading to be found within the many short chapters of this  book. "Eating the Locoweed" is one of my favourites. A.W. Tozer  had a way of taking a simple sentence and making the truth of it hit hard.  An example from "Eternal Retribution - A Bible Doctrine" :  "The man who will not believe in hell must surrender his right to  believe in heaven". Tozer's books stand in stark contrast to the  writings of many today; John Shelby Spong, Robert Funk et al. The masses  cling to anything that will "prove" a man right and God wrong.  One finds no such foolishness and blasphemy with Tozer thankfully.
