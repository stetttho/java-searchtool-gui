 Oh yeah, this is right up my alley! I stumbled upon Ashley's music when I  found a copy of "Big Town" in a used C.D. shop. I was  hooked.......how could she be writing about me when she's never met me?!  "Lesson Of Love" is somewhat different but beautiful and brillant  nevertheless. What a joy it is when someone with a voice you love sings  about the One you love.
