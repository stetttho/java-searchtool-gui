 Billy Graham does in this book what he does in life......let God do the talking and instructing. So much fluff is written on this subject and it is done with the attempt to take the glory away from God. This of course, is  something holy angels would never do as they were created to worship God  and to obey Him. Thankfully, Mr. Graham can always be depended on to be  faithful to the Word of God and this book is wonderful. For those who are  fascinated with angels and want a book about them, in all honesty, this is  the only book you'll ever need outside of the Bible. Discover for yourself  the beauty of angels and their adoration of Christ their King.
