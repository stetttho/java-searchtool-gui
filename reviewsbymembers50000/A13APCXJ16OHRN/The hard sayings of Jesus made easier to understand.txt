 F.F. Bruce is very often quoted by some of my favourite authors; now I  know why. I found this book to be most helpful to me in gaining a deeper  understanding of many of the things that Jesus said......and as a result am  able to apply them to my life in the appropriate way. There are 70 short  chapters in this book!! A couple of examples: "Taking Up The  Cross" and "Not Peace But A Sword". Excellent.
