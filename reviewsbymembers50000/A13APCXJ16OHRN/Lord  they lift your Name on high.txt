 What a wonderful C.D., really gets your heart pumping! "Let Our  Voices Rise Like Incense" is beautiful but like many of the songs, way  too short! The repeat button is always in use for "Lord We Lift Your  Name On High"! This recording is a very handy thing to have around  when you are yearning to worship with music and it's only Monday!
