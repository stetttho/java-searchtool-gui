 Many of Tozer's books are broken up into many, many short chapters on a  variety of subjects important to the faith. This approach makes it an  easier read....but this book is still power-packed. I especially like the  opening chapter, "That Incredible Christian". It is a delightful  essay on the pardoxical nature of living one's life in Christ.
