 Written with the determination to speak the truth in love, Joe Dallas has  accomplished what he set out to do. The gay-christian stance is a very  serious issue facing believers and society in general.....it is shot  through with emotion, anger and most sadly of all, pride. I am indebted to  the author for giving me a deeper understanding of both "sides"  and for handling this topic with such consideration and concern.
