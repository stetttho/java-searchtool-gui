 An excellent read that gives good insights to the person and the soldier Colin Powell.   There are plenty of good stories about Powell himself as well as the people he has served and those who have served him. It gives an insight into a person who (already at the time of the book) has had a tremendous impact on the Armed Forces as well as American polictics in generel.  We can only hope that there will be a sequal.
