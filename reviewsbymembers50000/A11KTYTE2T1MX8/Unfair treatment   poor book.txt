 Mary Mapes have no doubt been subjected to an incredibly unfair attack by part of the conservative right and that is tragic. In my book it doesnt even matter, that the newspiece that lead to it, was not very good journalism, was not all that well researched, balanced and a host of other things we all expect from good journalists. She was victimised, pure and simple.   Her book is unfortunately not a very good one, she is too self serving and too impressed with herself. Given her expericence, she should be able to give such a book a lot more teeth, be a lot sharper and to the point in her counter attack and let the reader more into her life at the time all of this was going on.
