 This books is really great on many levels. First, if you would like to know more about Black-Scholes formula, options pricing, bond pricing or refresh the knowledge you have, Derman lays it out for you in very plain and easily digestable language. Second, you enjoy reading brutally honest, entertaining and insightful accounts of amazing peoples lives, this if one of the best. After reading it I found myself admiring the professional courage Derman has shown all his life, as well as his refreshing direct and honest way of describing both his strengths and weaknesses.
