 Considering the career path that Lou Gerstner has followed, this book doesnt come close to its potential. That being said it is an interesting book about the turnaround for IBM and a few key insights of a high level CEO is shared with the reader. The book never comes really under the skin of neither IBM or Lou Gerstner, but ofcourse thats an opening for a sequal.
