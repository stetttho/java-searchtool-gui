 There is little doubt that Warren Buffett is one of the most successful business men of our time. The track record of Berkshire Hathaway speaks for it self, as does Warren Buffett. He has made a point out of speaking frankly and openly at the Annual Meetings for the shareholders and printing the yearly reports will give you all his thoughts throughout the years.  This book organises his thoughts very well into a number of key areas and thereby leads you through the Buffett Universe. It is a very intelligent and surprisingly unsofisticated one, build on a set of core values the corporate businesses should take a careful look at.  If you like investing yourself, this also gives you a few hints on what to focus on and what not to focus on. The Oracle from Omaha is always entertaining and this book makes that very obvious and is well worth a read.   Be aware......it is not a normal business book, you may find yourself laughing from time to time....
