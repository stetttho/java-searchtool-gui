 Blumenthal writes passionately about the Clinton presidency as you would expect. The first 200 pages or so are comments on the first term where he did not work for Clinton, and I only skimmed through those as it was mostly references to other sources. The next 500 pages are much more personal and although nothing new and surprising comes out, Blumenthal still writes a fairly balanced account of the events and shows his brilliant polical and intellectual mind on many occassions. An important part of the history writing of the Clinton presidency.
