 The title is great and seems to indicate that you as a new father can learn something from this book.  I did not find that to be the case. It lacks structure and doesnt present information in an interesting way. The actual information is also scarce and nothing new is added to the "normal" books on this topic. As a new father you will not be much wiser on your new role after reading this book.  I found Christine Harris's books to be much better and would recommend those.
