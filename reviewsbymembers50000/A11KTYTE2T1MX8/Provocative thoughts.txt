 The two authors eloquently takes the reader through a series of arguments relating seemingly non related issues to eachother (sumo wrestlers and school teachers for example) and present a new view on those by using an economists approach.  It is a great book to get a new view and argumentation on abortion, crime and parenting, although some readers should be prepared that some views are quite provocative, but nonetheless exiting.
