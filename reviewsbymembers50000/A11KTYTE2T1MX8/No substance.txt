 This is a very poorly written book, to say the least.  It is one of the many books written by folks that worked in the Clinton administration, providing an inside view of the events, but this one is extremely simple and does not add anything new to the discussions about Clinton or his administration.   Some of the things Clinton did during his administration was clearly disgraceful, but Pattersons conclusions are based on few observations (at least few that he shares) and many of them are repeated over and over again.   Large parts of the book are more like a biography of Patterson, who has appearently flown on nearly every mission that is worth speaking of, but who has been of absolutely no consequence to decision making in any administration. On the contrary his job as military aide to the president seems to have been more about caddying than about carrying out a top military job. On top that Patterson has a rather simplistic view on world politics and seems to want to hunt down and kill everyone that might potentially be a threat to United States.
