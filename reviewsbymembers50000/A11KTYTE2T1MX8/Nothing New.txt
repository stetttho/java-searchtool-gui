 Perhaps it is because the book is now 5 years old, but reading it now in 2002 it adds no value. Most of the "advise" given is very generic and does not break any new ground (which I am sure it did not do in 1997 either). For the non-financial manager there might be some new things in there, but the the CFO or other finance professionals the book can serve as a brush-up at best.
