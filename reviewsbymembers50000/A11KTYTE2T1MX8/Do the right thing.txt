 As always Julia Alvarez tells a great story, and a story with a point. It is a short story that is very charming and depicts Dominican Republic in a very accurate way.    The story is about a foreigner coming to Dominican Republic and how he slowly gets to know about what goes on "behind the scenes" in coffee making.   The story could have been about any type of farming, carpentry etc and the point would have been the same: The environment and those who works with it DOES matter.
