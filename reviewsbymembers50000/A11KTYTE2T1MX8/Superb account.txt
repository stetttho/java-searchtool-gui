 The great writing skills of James B Stewart can be enjoyed in all of his books and certainly also in this one. He book reads almost like a thriller, but it is always clear that Stewarts has his facts right and well documented and got the criminals dead to rights.  The book is structured as the first part being seen from the side of Boesky, Milken etc and the second part from the law enforcement, which is another feature that makes it very exiting to read.
