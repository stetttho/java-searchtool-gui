 This is a truly magnificent book that give great insight into the strategy and method of one of the most successfull leaders ever. It is very inspiring to read how Jack Welch has managed a company as big as GE with relatively simple means, and this should be an encouragement to all in senior management. Further the book is filled with good anecdotes and a humorous approach to nearly everything.
