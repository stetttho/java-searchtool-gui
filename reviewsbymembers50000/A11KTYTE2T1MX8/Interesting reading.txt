 This autobiography is interesting reading indeed, in that Ronald Reagan was a very fascinating person and his life certainly amazign in every aspect. I hesitate to give it a raving review and more than 3 stars, as it doesnt seem to fully live up to the subject matter. It lacks analysis and sophistication, but is still worth a read.
