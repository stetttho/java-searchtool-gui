 This is without a doubt one of the most revealing and breath taking accounts of how the Bush Administration works. O'Neill and Suskind have done a great job making this a fantastic book that you cannot put down. Amazing insights into the way Bush works as well as into some of the finer details of tax legislation and politics in general. O'Neill was and is clearly one of a kind and it is a shame that Bush did not have the courage to let him do his job. For sure some of the prominent cabinet members as well as White House staffers will have glowing red ears when they read this.
