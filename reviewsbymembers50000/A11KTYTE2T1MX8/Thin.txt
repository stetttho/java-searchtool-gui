 Colin Martin has clearly been through Hell and lived to tell the tale. Unfortunately the book does not do justice to his ordeal as it is totally lacking in detail, reflection, conclusions and insights. As an example he does not reveal how he makes money in the jail (refused to work, so no income there), nor does he describe in detail his relationship with the other inmates, family in Ireland, colleagues or other people around him. It is an easy read and will not take up much of your time, but if you have alternatives, use them.
