 For those who like books about the mob this is a reasonably good book. Be prepared though, Franzese is VERY determined to convince you that you should become a religous fanatic like him, and that because he is a true believer today, all his past sins are now forgiven. It is understandable why he would have that view on things, but depeding on your belief system, it becomes a bit of a drag in the end. However, he is a great story teller and the book is easily read.
