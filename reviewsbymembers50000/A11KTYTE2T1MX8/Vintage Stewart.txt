 As with all the books of James B Stewart, this book reads like a thriller and what gives you a real chill is that it isnt. That is all normal for a James B Stewart book, so for those who are not familiar with him, hurry up and order the book and start learning of things you never knew existed or could exist. For those familiar with his books, this is just as good as the others and well worth a read. He stays away from personal comments and conclusions and reports the story as it is.
