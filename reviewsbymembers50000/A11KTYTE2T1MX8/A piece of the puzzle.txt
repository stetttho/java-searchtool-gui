 With this book George Stephanopoulos provides yet another inside look into the Clinton administration. He is clearly a very intelligent person with a good grip on the power games in Washington.   The book is filled with descriptions of situations and events from his time in the White House, but lacks real analysis of his and Clintons achievements or lack of same. One wonders if he might have been better off waiting a few more years to gain more perspective on his own performance. He was a very young Senior Advisor and perhaps some more time would have helped him understand how that influenced the decision making.  Even with the lack of true analysis the book is an important piece of the puzzle if you want to understand the Clinton White House and George Stephanopoulos writes well and keeps the reader interested all the way through. Hopefully there will be a sequal at some point.
