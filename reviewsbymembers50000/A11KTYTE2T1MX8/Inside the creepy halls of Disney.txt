 If you had any doubt that Michael Eisner totally mismanaged Disney and disregarded the shareholders, particularly in the last couple of years, this book should forever remove those doubts.  The book almost reads like fiction and is a page turner if I ever read one. The sad part obviously is that it is non-fiction, and that a significant amount of people have paid for Eisners and the Disney boards incompetent and inappropriate management for years.
