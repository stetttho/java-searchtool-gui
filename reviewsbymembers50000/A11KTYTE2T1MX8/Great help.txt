 As an expecting parent (mom as well as dad) this book will help you get the answers to the most common questions as well as provide you with basic information on the progression of the pregnancy.  For every week you get some very basic info, size of the baby, size of the mom, what the mom and the baby will go through in the week to come etc. AND the most important thing, a funny little tip or two, such as what excercise to do or how the dad can be particularly helpful.  In our house we have both enjoyed the book and used it very frequently for checking if there was some information that could help us. 9 out of 10 times there was.  Highly recommendable.
