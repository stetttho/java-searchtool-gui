 This small, well organized, and beautifully illustrated book is an unexpectedly thorough and complete reference on vampire lore in Western culture. Succinctly written and carefully researched, it presents an entertaining and informative account on the mythical and religious origins of vampires, citing innumerable traditional, historical and literary sources, from the earliest civilizations to the present day. It also includes a discussion on the evolution and permanence of vampires in our culture through literature and films, featuring an exhaustive filmography of the most often dramatized of all fictional characters. For those interested in pursuing a deeper study of the subject, the bibliographical reference titled Further Reading and the List of Illustrations, both located in the back of the book, will prove to be invaluable resources. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
