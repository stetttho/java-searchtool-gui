 This figure is Toy Biz's take on Galadriel as she appears tempted by the power of The One Ring, after Frodo offers it to her at Lothlrien, in The Fellowship of the Ring movie. As simple as this figure looks, it's probably one of the most elaborate of the entire Lord of the Rings toy line. Her ragged, translucent, layered clothes, her ruffled hair, her detailed, tarnished armor, and a color scheme consisting of pallid and emerald greens, and many shades of verdigris brass, bronze and copper, give it a very dramatic ghostlike appearance. Its eyes are made of transparent jade plastic and they glow eerily when you press the Light-Up Action button under her hair. And its likeness to Cate Blanchett, the actress who plays the character in the movie, is unquestionably impressive; its expression faithfully captures the wavering of her will at the otherworldly temptation of possessing the Ring.  Furthermore, although not considered as part of the "Super Posable" lot, this is a substantially articulated figure that allows for a variety of movements and positions that extends well beyond that of most figures. And the fact that it doesn't come with any accessories is not an oversight, it just doesn't need them; on its own this figure accomplishes the look and feel of the entire scene that inspired it. This is a must have addition for every collection. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
