 This DVD contains four digitally remastered (great image quality) classic Dr. Seuss stories: * Green Eggs and Ham: about Sam-I-Am and his never ending quest to make people sample the dish he loves best. * The Sneetches: about a narrow-minded and prejudiced group of creatures who don't accept others who don't look exactly like them. * The Zax: about two hardheaded and proud beings who waste a whole lifetime for not yielding the right of way. * Grinch Night: about a courageous kid who faces the Grinch and saves his whole town from his malicious Halloween tricks and terrors. (A must see on Halloween night). It also contains two wonderful sing-along songs: He Will Eat Them and Grinches Inches Closer. Not only does this collection of cartoons contains the marvelous songs and poetry of Dr. Seuss, it is also a great way to teach kids about human values like open-mindedness, tolerance and acceptance, humility, courage and selflessness. They are filled with original art and are also very entertaining. Buy this DVD for your kids and enjoy it with them. I would also recommend buying Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat and Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
