 This movie is bad, bad, bad. It has no plot, no acting and no character development. I give it two stars for two basic reasons, special effects (seamlessly woven into the action and paying homage to old martial arts movies) and humor (Lee Evans's performance is hilarious). A Hong Kong detective (Jackie Chan) is investigating a well-known but mysterious international smuggler (Julian Sands) when he discovers that the smuggler is after an ancient magical medallion that has the ability to resurrect people and give them eternal life. The chosen keeper of the medallion, a kid, is kidnapped and taken to Dublin where the smuggler will use him to unleash the power of the medallion. The detective follows the trail and recruits the help of two Interpol agents, an old love (Claire Forlani) and a clumsy and less than courageous partner (Lee Evans). Trying to save the kid, the detective gets killed and resurrected, with superhuman powers and eternal life added for bonus. Then the battle for good and evil ensues. This movie is boring, slow moving, very badly acted (although is cast with good leads) and not entertaining at all. The characters are weak and ridiculous, and overall the movie's quality is below most past Jackie Chan's movies. Don't waste your time and money. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
