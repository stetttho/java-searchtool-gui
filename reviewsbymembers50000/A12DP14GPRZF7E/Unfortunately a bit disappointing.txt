 This figure is Toy Biz's take on the Weathertop wraiths burned by Aragorn's torch after Frodo was pierced by one of their deadly swords in the Fellowship of the Ring movie. Although this is not a bad figure, as it has a good concept behind it and the great quality that we've come to expect from the manufacturer, overall it's rather disappointing. When compared with similar previous figures from the line, it probably ranks closer to the Ringwraith that came out right after the first movie was released than to the superior Morgul Lord Witch-King of recent days. It comes with a single accessory, the less-than-formidable Nazgul sword, and it doesn't really come with any sound effects as advertised on the name given to it here at Amazon. Moreover, its main appeal, the light-up feature, even if the flames on his cloak extend from the top of his head and down his left side to the rim of his sleeve, only works for the ones on the side of his head. This is a very sad letdown, because not only are the sculpt and painting of the flames excellent, but the plastic they are made of glows brilliantly realistic when lit. If you, like me, feel that having every different figures of this line that Toy Biz dishes out is an imperative, then get this figure, as it's not exactly just a simple repaint or re-imaging of a pre-existing one. If you are picky about your choices thought, you might consider passing it up. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
