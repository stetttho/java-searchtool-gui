 This figure is Toy Biz's take on Frodo as he appears halfway on his journey to Mount Doom, where he must go to destroy The One Ring, in The Two Towers movie. Its likeness to Elijah Wood, the actor who plays the character in the movie, is almost as good as Frodo's with Light-Up Sting, but the latter's is still the best so far. Its detailing on the clothing and accessories though is a lot better: you can see the tiny Elven engravings on Sting's blade, the weaving on Frodo's coat fabric and even the Ring hanging on a narrow chain around its neck. The figure comes with two removable accessories: Sting, which you can place on the scabbard hanging from Frodo's left hip, and an Elven cloak with a leaf brooch and an attached backpack. 30 points of articulation, which make it part of the "Super Posable" line, allow for a variety of movements and positions that extends well beyond that of most figures; even his hands and feet, and elbows and knees are articulated in two or more places. This is a great figure all-around, and one that is perfect as a display piece that you'll be tempted to continually pose. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
