 This figure is Toy Biz's take on Gandalf the Grey as he appears battling the Balrog at the Bridge of Khazad-dm, Moria, in The Fellowship of the Ring movie. Although nicely detailed, complete with tousled hair, a dirty robe, a tired yet determined expression, and two accessories, his sword and his staff, this isn't the best of all the Gandalf figures.  His likeness to Ian McKellan, the actor who plays the character in the movie, is not as good as Gandalf the White's from Series 1 of The Two Towers line - for me the best so far. The Electronic Sound Base clearly shouts the phrase "You shall not pass!" in the actor's voice - you can even hear it echoing in the deep halls of Moria - and a couple pegs securely support the figure by its feet when it stands on top of it, but overall it's just a bit too short to give the impression of a long narrow stone bridge. And while this figure is actually inspired in a scene from the Fellowship of the Ring movie, it has been cheaply packaged for The Two Towers series by changing the names and pictures on Gandalf the White's card - even the literature on the back is the same.  But where this figure really falls short is in the fact that its staff doesn't light up, a feature that was included in the first Gandalf figure to ever come out. I would have gladly paid a couple more bucks to have this figure with that kind of Light-Up Action included. If it had, it probably would have been one of the coolest figures of the entire collection. Buy it aware of what you're getting.  --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
