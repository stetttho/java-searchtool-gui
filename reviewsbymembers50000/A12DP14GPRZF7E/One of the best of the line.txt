 This figure is the one that's included on the Hasbro Episode III 3/4" Basic Figure Checklist under the name of Anakin Skywalker on Mustafar, and it's the 50th figure released so far from the Revenge of the Sith line. Not only does it include two figures in one package, one fully robed Anakin and one lava-burned Anakin, but also both of them come with interchangeable heads and arms to create several different look combinations. Both are also extremely posable, and would look really cool alongside its Obi-Wan counterpart on the Mustafar playset. The sculpt for each figure is terrific - and in the case of the burned Anakin the details are terrifyingly realistic and the most movie accurate I've seen to date. The only additional accessory they include is Anakin's lightsaber, which is stronger than the ones previously released.   This is one of the must-have figures for any serious collector, and either of the two figures is worth the price of the whole package alone. Don't miss out on this one; grab one while you still can. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
