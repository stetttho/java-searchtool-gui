 This book is a beautiful, complete reprint of the original 1970's stories that shaped Ra's al Ghul and Batman's relationship. It includes issues #232, 235, 240, 242, 243 and 244 of Batman Comics, Detective Comics #411, 485, 489 and 490, and DC Special Series Volume 2 #15. Since they are collected in a single volume in the same format that they were originally printed and released (from non-sequential issues), when reading from cover to cover there are many gaps in the story line, some seemingly unresolved endings and a few abrupt beginnings. Remember, Ra's al Ghul's case was one Batman kept open between his usual obligations to Gotham. Also noticeable is the fact that neither Batman nor Ra's al Ghul live up to their present-day personalities in these stories. But, it's fair to keep in mind that Adams and O'Neil's was the first attempt to return the Dark Knight to his dark, gothic origins and break the stride of his 1960's camp characterization. This they cleverly did by matching him against an antagonist that not only respected him and constantly tested his prowess and investigative abilities, but that also wanted to recruit him as his successor, making the Batman doubt his own morality. This volume's value is mostly archival, collecting every appearance of Ra's al Ghul and containing the sources of other events in the life of the Caped Crusader like his marriage to Talia, Ra's's daughter, the death of the first Batgirl, and the origins of Matches Malone. As a bonus, it also includes a delightful introduction by Sam Hamm, explaining the villain's creation, and an afterword by Dennis O'Neil, looking back at his involvement with Batman over the years. Printed in great colors and illustrated in the traditional 1970's style, this is definitely an interesting look at the history of Batman and the first appearances of one of his most memorable nemesis.
