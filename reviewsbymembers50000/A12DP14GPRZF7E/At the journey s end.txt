 This figure is Toy Biz's take on Frodo, as he appears in the Return of the King movie on the slopes of Mount Doom at the end of his journey to destroy The One Ring. At a glance this figure might seem unexceptional, but its merits lie on the things that are better noticed upon closer inspection: * Its remarkable likeness to a gaunt and exhausted Elijah Wood, the actor who plays the character in the movie * Its extremely good sculpt and detailing; the ragged and disheveled clothing, the dirt on its hands and feet, the despair in its eyes * Its "Super Posable" construction that offers 29 points of articulation and allows for a wide variety of movements and positions far superior to that of most other figures Furthermore, it comes with a unique neck design that lets its head bend forward and its chin rest above its chest to recreate Frodo's posture in the scene from the movie in which he is reclined against Sam after the destruction of the Ring. From that scene too is the emotive phrase recorded on the Sound Base in the actor's voice: "I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee, here at the end of all things." The base, which imitates a rocky slope by which a fiery current of lava slowly flows, also comes with a "Play" button disguised as a stone, and a couple of pegs that securely hold the figure by its feet when displayed standing on top of it. My one disappointment with this figure is the result of a major oversight by the manufacturer: the Ring carefully painted hanging on a narrow chain around its neck had already been destroyed in the scene that the figure is meant to stand for. Even so, I still consider this figure worthy of being recommended as a good addition to any collector's display, especially when paired with Mount Doom Sam. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
