 This small, extremely detailed, well-organized and beautifully illustrated book is as thorough as such a short and small book on mummies can be.  Succinctly written and carefully researched, it presents a richly-depicted and very informative history of Egyptian mummies, from their creation by ceremonial priests, to their discovery by Arab, French and British explorers and archaeologists, to their present day status and location. Supported by contemporary research and citing innumerable historical sources, it includes topics like the mummification process, the Egyptian meaning of immortality and life after death, the greatest mummy discoveries ever made, and the past and present study of mummies and their tombs. But, be advised that this book only covers Egyptian mummies; the authors intentionally leave out any mention of any other mummies, including those found in China, Peru, North America and Northern Europe, so you'll have to look elsewhere for information on those. As a bonus, the book includes a Map and Chronology of Ancient Egypt. And for those interested in pursuing a deeper study of the subject, a bibliographical reference titled Further Reading and a List of Illustrations, both located in the back of the book, will prove to be invaluable resources. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
