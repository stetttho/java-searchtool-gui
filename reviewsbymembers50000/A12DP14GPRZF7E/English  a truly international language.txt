 This illuminating, well-researched and entertaining reference, introduces us to a comprehensive collection of foreign words and phrases that have, over many decades, been adopted, assimilated, and absorbed into our English lexicon. This book is written in a very clear, informative style, with the author's whimsical, humorous commentaries often adding a pleasurable and often witty touch to his discussion. The words are arranged alphabetically in a dictionary format, which facilitates browsing or consulting. Each entry includes the word's pronunciation, origin, original meaning, approximate date of introduction into English, and the meaning of its current usage. If you want to know how, when and where words like smorgasbord, chutzpah and paparazzi, and expressions like femme fatale and persona non grata made it into English, then, this is the book you need. It's a fun historical record of our vocabulary's most celebrated international contributors. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
