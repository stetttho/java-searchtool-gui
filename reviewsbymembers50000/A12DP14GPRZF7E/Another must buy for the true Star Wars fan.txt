 This book is the following volume to the Star Wars Cookbook: Wookie Cookies and Other Galactic Recipes and like its predecessor it has the same beautifully illustrated, spiral-bound, hardcover format. It is another must buy for serious Star Wars fans that want to keep adding delicious Star Wars themed recipes to their lives and want to have fun while preparing their meals. The book is divided into five sections for easy reference: Breakfasts, Snacks and Sides, Main Courses, Desserts and Treats, and Drinks. Each Star Wars themed recipe is fully and clearly explained (ingredient measurements and preparation instructions) for easy understanding. The book's introduction contains practical advice on cooking safety and includes a guide of the cooking tools you'll need. As an added bonus, the pages of the book are laminated for easy, stain-free cleaning. You will love all the recipes, and will probably recreate, the wonderfully photographed serving suggestions given in the book like the Booma Breakfast Tarts, the Pit Droid Pizza, and the Qui-Gon Jinn-ger Snaps which are decorated with the action figures of known characters of the Star Wars Episode I movie. Other recipes' presentations feature enjoyable visual puns like the Boss Nass Broccoli, the Protocol Droid Pasta and the Darth Maul Dip (which even includes a plastic template for decoration). Some are even very basic, but really tasty, recipes that have been given clever Star Wars-sounding names like Darth Malt, Panakacakes and Pickle Jar Jar. Buy this book, and share the joy of cooking and your love of everything Star Wars with kids and adults, family and friends. And May The Force Be With You. I would also recommend buying the Star Wars Cookbook and The Star Wars Party Book along with this one as they all make a complete, excellent and fun idea source book for everyday cooking and Star Wars themed parties. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
