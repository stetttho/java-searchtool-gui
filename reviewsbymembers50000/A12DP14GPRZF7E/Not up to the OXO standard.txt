 Overall, this is a sturdy, handy and attractive can opener with a built-in bottle opener for pop-top caps.  Its sharp teeth and beveled blade bite into lids of all sizes with ease. Its ergonomic design and big, pressure-absorbing, outstanding non-slip grips allow you comfortable, daily use. Its large, easy-to-turn knob and hefty body that fit comfortably into your hands, make it require less force to operate than other, more traditional openers do, keeping you away from cramped hands and other tension related injuries. Its elegant, stylized, standard OXO shape will fit perfectly with the rest of your OXO utensils in the kitchen or in the bar. But, unlike the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, this one is not such a great value and it is below the established standards of superior quality, unsurpassed durability and flawless performance of the OXO brand.  While most of its metal parts are stainless-steel some others are not, like the screws holding the blade and the teeth, and will begin to rust after a couple of years of normal, everyday use. Also, the rubber grips are glued, and will change from "fixed" to "removable" after just a few months of function. Moreover, although it is manually easy to clean, it is also advertised as dishwasher-safe, but it retains water inside the grips after they have become unglued and also inside the large hollow of the knob, making it impossible to retrieve from the dishwasher without getting drenched or making a mess. After submitting this product to two years of normal use, mine will soon be replaced. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
