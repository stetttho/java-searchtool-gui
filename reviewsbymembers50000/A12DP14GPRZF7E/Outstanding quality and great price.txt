 This wire potato masher, like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability, and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design, hefty body, and big, pressure-absorbing, non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers, are the reasons why you'll prefer this product over the more traditional models, as they will allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use while keeping you away from any stress-related injuries. Its elegant, stylized shape fits seamlessly with the rest of the OXO Good Grips collection, and it also comes with an oversized hole at the tip of the handle for easy hanging, and a strong, stout double-wire neck guaranteed to be unbendable. Overall, this masher is perfect to mash potatoes, apples, pumpkins, carrots and other such foods, especially handy if you have a baby in the house. Its easy-to-clean, simple construction and dishwasher-safe, hard-wearing materials make it an addition that will prove a dependable part of your cooking equipment for years. Furthermore, its stainless-steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away.  After submitting this product to over two years of normal, everyday use, mine is still just like new. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
