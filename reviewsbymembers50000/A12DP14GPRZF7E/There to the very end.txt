 This figure is Toy Biz's take on Samwise Gamgee, Frodo's loyal friend and companion, as he appears in the Return of the King movie on the slopes of Mount Doom at the end of the journey to destroy The One Ring. Its likeness to a weary but hopeful Sean Astin, the actor who plays the character in the movie, surpasses every other figure of Sam released so far. The sculpting, the painting and the delicate detailing on this figure are commendable: its dirty hands and feet, its ragged and disheveled clothing, its ruffled hair, and its pitiful eyes are particularly well done. A part of the "Super Posable" line, it has 29 points of articulation, allowing for a variety of movements and positions that extends well beyond that of most figures. Furthermore, by combining it with Mount Doom Frodo you can recreate the scene in which Frodo is reclined against Sam on the slopes of Mount Doom after the destruction of the Ring. From the scene before that one are the two phrases recorded in the actor's voice on the Sound Base: "Throw it in the fire!" and "I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!" The base, which imitates a rocky slope, also comes with a couple of pegs that securely hold the figure by its feet when displayed standing on top of it. The one disappointing feature the figure has is also its only accessory: Frodo's sword, Sting. This is the worst representation of it I have seen; its blade is too narrow, its hilt is too big, and the Elven engravings so carefully etched on previous models are too crude and sloppy on this one. It's really a shame that the manufacturers took so little care with it, especially after having taken the time to place such a beautifully decorated scabbard for it on the figure's left hip. Still, it is a figure worth adding to any serious collector's display, especially when paired with Mount Doom Frodo. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
