 If you need to keep your writing sharp, or simply want to be taught, in common, everyday terms, the correct rules and usage of the English grammar, then this is the perfect guidebook for you: straightforward, enlightening, fun and free of technical jargon and grammatical fluff. Extremely well organized, masterfully indexed and fully cross-referenced, it makes all topics readily accessible for fast checkups and repeated consultations. Written in a concise, lighthearted style, and combining witty instruction with sound advice and excellent examples that illustrate beyond any doubt the points being made, this is the most useful, entertaining and humorous book on English grammar available today. Treated along the most common topics (pronouns, numbers, possessives, punctuation, plurals, cliches, etc.) are other not so common, yet invaluable, subjects: a list of frequent mistakes writers make, a discussion on outdated choices of usage and a glossary. Overall, this is a very affordable, handy reference and delightful read that you'll keep going back to again and again. If you are a professional writer, you might consider complementing this book with other, more extensive publications like the latest edition of The Chicago Manual of Style and Strunk's The Elements of Style. And, for even further study, the book's bibliography constitutes a first-class resource for choosing additional reading material. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
