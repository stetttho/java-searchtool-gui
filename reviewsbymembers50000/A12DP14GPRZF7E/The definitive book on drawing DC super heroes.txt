 This beautifully illustrated, easy to follow, step-by-step, how-to guide is the most useful and complete book on the basic drawing techniques you need to accurately depict the cartoon characters of the DC universe (in the Bruce Timm/Animated Series style) available on the market today. The information and instructions contained in this book are wonderfully organized and presented in step-by-step format (from rough sketch to finished drawing), include a list of tools and materials you need to get started and cover topics that include: guidelines on basic figure drawing, head and figure proportions, movements and expressions, comparisons of male and female figure features, and perspective and foreshortening for backgrounds and figures. The book also contains a detailed treatment on how to draw DC heroes and villains, from the well-known (Batman, Superman, Flash, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, the Joker, Poison Ivy, Lex Luthor, etc.) to the less-known (Starman, Huntress, Black Canary, the Gentleman Ghost, etc.) As a bonus, the book teaches us how to draw places like Gotham City, Metropolis and Themystira. This book is a simple, excellent and thorough resource for creating your own DC Comics super hero adventures, at the same time that you begin to understand the basic principles of cartooning and animation. This is a mandatory book for the shelf of kids and adults who want to draw the world of DC Comics like professional artists in a relatively short time. A note of caution: this book not only includes everything contained in two previous Ty Templeton books: How to Draw Batman and How to Draw Superman, but also a lot more. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
