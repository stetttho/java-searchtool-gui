 This well organized, informative and concise volume offers a clearly written collection of essays on the complete history of seventy of the world's greatest engineering and construction achievements from the year 1500 A. D. to the present. Each structure is carefully detailed in a well-researched, short entry of two to four pages long. Basic facts like who built it, where, when and why are covered, and additional information is also provided like its basic statistics, the politics associated with its construction, accounts of the project's development and other fascinating data. Moreover, for quick check-ups, each wonder is accurately placed in one of the seven categories into which the book is divided: Churches, Mosques, Temples & Shrines; Palaces & Castles; Public & State Buildings; Towers & Skyscrapers; Bridges, Railways & Tunnels; Canals & Dams; and Colossal Statues. This reference is handsomely presented in a sturdy binding, printed in top-quality paper, and beautifully illustrated with over 350 spectacular photos, explanatory diagrams, magnificent reconstructions and historical drawings. Featured among the showcased selection are The Statue of Liberty, The Panama Canal, The Eiffel Tower, The Taj Mahal, and The Forbidden City, and the rest of the masterpieces included are equal testimony of man's unending imagination and its application beyond mere aesthetic power, structural virtuosity or plain utility. As a bonus, the book includes an introduction that explains the criteria used to pick the selected structures. A comprehensive bibliography especially useful for further research and a thorough index, for specific consultations, are also included. This is a fact-filled compendium that readers of all ages will undoubtedly refer to again and again. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
