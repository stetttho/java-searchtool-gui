 The book is very complete and very easy to understand with step by step instructions that don't clog you mind or are hard to remember. Walking is presented as a healthy habit that will ensure a new way of working out and  staying in shape. The book sets you up with valuable information from  choosing the right gear to avoiding injuries to getting fit.  It's a great  book for beginners because it motivates you to start and keep fit without  making it a routine or monotonous experience, helping you move to higher  levels or workouts, while keeping the habit of walking. It makes a great  addition to have along with Nutrition for Dummies and Workouts for Dummies. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
