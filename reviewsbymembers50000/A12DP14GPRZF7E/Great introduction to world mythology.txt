 Written in the friendly Dummies style, illustrated with many pictures, drawings, maps, charts, humorous icon guides and even hilarious cartoons, this book presents the best collection of explained myths, legends, traditions and folktales available today in a single volume. Through simple, yet detailed, and clear explanations, this reference covers in less than 350 pages the gods, divinities, heroes, monsters and places that are part of our world's vast collection of mythologies. Organized according to their provenance, the selection discussed includes the Greek, Roman, Northern European, Mesopotamian, Hebrew, Egyptian, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Latin American and Northern American Indian mythologies. It also explores the everyday connection between them and the societies that created them, and their relevance in the religion, literature, art, politics and even the social organization of the civilizations from which they came. As a bonus, the book contains two sections, Ten Mythological Monsters and Ten Mythological Places, which give detailed and engrossing descriptions of the most fabulous monsters and fantastic places that are a direct product of mythology. Since this book is fully cross-referenced comparisons between mythologies are very easy to make, and its very thorough index is great for quick check-ups and specific consultations. Although this book could have been edited better, since it has a more than just a few typographical errors and repeated paragraphs, it is a very well researched, informative and entertaining reference, even presented with a dash of humor, that makes learning about world mythologies fun.  The information and the literary and historical references in this book are well worth its price, and make it the most entertaining place to start your mythological studies and an extraordinary resource to launch you into a deeper study of mythology. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
