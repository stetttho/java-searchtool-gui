 This is a delightful movie, probably unlike any you've ever seen. All the characters are so well balanced and adorable, and their story is so well told that it makes you feel it's a true story about real people. It's refreshing, sweet, entertaining and charming. A group of friends puts together a music band and they record a song. The song gets on the radio and quickly climbs the music charts, making them an overnight success. Their unexpected and speedily growing fame puts their relationships, as well as individual integrity and self-respect, to the test. Troubles arise, and with them the characters show their true natures, good and bad, making their musical career as a rock group as brief and ephemeral as lightning. But despite the obstacles the characters face, a few good things derive from them, new relationships are formed, old ones are strengthened, and all the characters make the choices that allow them to successfully follow their dreams after having lived through a life-changing, once-in-a-lifetime experience. The score of the film is great and the songs are true to the style and the music of the sixties, which is the period in which the movie takes place. The clothing and sets are accurate and the characters are wonderfully adapted to the fads of the time. The writing, plot and dialogues are superbly well done (by Tom Hanks) and makes each and every character come alive, even those with just a few minutes of screen time. The cast is exquisitely chosen, including Tom Everett Scott, Liv Tyler and Tom Hanks, and their performances are natural and enjoyable. This movie is a delight to watch time and again; each time you'll discover new details from the richly layered, yet realistic and simple personality of each character. A must-buy for anyone who likes a movie that tells a high-quality story through the eyes of interesting and refreshing characters. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
