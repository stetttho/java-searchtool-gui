 This short, beautifully illustrated book, part of the "See Inside" series aimed at young readers, is a good, easy to understand reference on the everyday life of people in and around a medieval castle. Through colorful, thoughtfully detailed drawings, it describes the layout, structure and evolution of various castle designs, using cross-sections and cutaways to allow the reader to look right inside of them. Simple, clear diagrams explain the reasoning behind some of their better-known features and how their building tools and defensive technology functioned, and accurate reconstructions show how their inhabitants worked and lived. As a bonus, this volume includes: * A section on famous medieval castles, complete with color photos. * A chronological chart of important European and Middle Eastern events from around 400 to 1700 BC. * A glossary of common terms used throughout the book. * A thorough index for quick check-ups and specific consultations. Although the revised edition of this book came out in 1986, and as it stands it's not inaccurate at all, a few facts and some information could use some updating and expanding with knowledge gathered from ongoing historical research and discoveries of more recent archaeological digs.  Overall this book is still a generally good teaching tool for adults and a fun reference for kids who want to be transported to another time in the evolution of our civilization. Other titles in the series include an Ancient Greek Town, a Roman Town, an Ancient Chinese Town, an Egyptian Town and a Galleon. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
