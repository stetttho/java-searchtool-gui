 This pint-sized, delightful book, richly and colorfully illustrated with thirty of Tolkien's own drawings, contains all twelve poems from the Hobbit as they were originally published. As a bonus, it also includes the eight riddles Gollum poses to Bilbo, complete with their answers. This wonderful volume is sure to be enjoyable to readers of all ages, and a wonderful keepsake that Tolkien followers can afford to carry around with them wherever they go. You shouldn't miss it. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
