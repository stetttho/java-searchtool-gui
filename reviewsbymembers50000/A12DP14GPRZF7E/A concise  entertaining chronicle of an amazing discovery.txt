 The discovery of Tutankhamen's tomb is probably one of the most famous and significant contributions ever made to the study of Ancient Egyptian religious traditions. But, the unusual events and mysterious deaths of numerous people linked with the opening of the tomb that soon followed, and the growing, widespread belief in a curse guarding the young pharaoh's mummy is now a legend almost as famous as the discovery of the tomb itself. Drawing his information from a rich selection of sources and carefully piecing it together in as factual and chronologically accurate account as possible, the author takes us in an exciting journey of exploration, adventure and sinister developments. He offers a realistic portrait of the men behind the discovery, a clear picture of the breathtaking treasures of the pharaoh, and an excellent look at the events that sparked the imagination and gave way to the belief in an ancient curse. As a bonus, the book is illustrated with pictures of Carter's 1922 expedition, includes a very detailed chronology of relevant events, presents a full plan of the tomb, complete with measurements, and gives us an introductory survey of early Egyptian life and culture. Was there really a curse on the tomb of Tutankhamen? Read the book and decide for yourself. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
