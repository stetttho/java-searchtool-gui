 From the writer of "Woe Is I" comes the companion volume "Words Fail Me", full of invaluable insights on clear and correct writing, and as instructional, informative, practical and witty as its predecessor. This book, written in an engrossing, humorous and charming style, offers useful advice on effective writing, including topics such as subject, time and place, point of view, repetitions, rhythm, emotion, writer's block, sense and reason, and even the writer's audience. It is extremely well organized for quick checkups, and covers both the basics and the not so basics that any decent guide on good writing should. The examples presented are carefully chosen to perfectly illustrate the advice given, and the tips and tricks included will permanently help you avoid the common errors that usually hinder the flow and smoothness of fine writing. No book can make you a better writer, but this book can make you better at writing. Whether you are a beginner or a professional, a fiction or nonfiction writer, or simply someone who loves writing but dislikes studying the nuts-and-bolts of English in droning grammar and composition textbooks, this book will prove itself to be a priceless reference. Besides the author's "Woe Is I" I also recommend, for equally sound advice on writing, minus the added wit and humor, Zinsser's "On Writing Well" and Strunk's "The Elements of Style." --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
