 This inexpensive, sturdy, entertaining book contains a one-a-day collection of 365 amusing, insightful and even witty quotes, drawn from a rich group of personalities whose birthday is celebrated on date under which they are featured. Ranging from poets, novelists, artists and movie stars, to scientists, politicians and philosophers, the quoted authors include William Blake, Lewis Carroll, Edgar Degas, Sophia Loren, Isaac Newton, Richard Nixon, Albert Camus, and 358 others. All the quotes are encoded in substitution cipher, each letter standing for another, and with varying degrees of difficulty they are guaranteed to keep you busy for hours as you find yourself using your intuition, your knowledge of spelling and syntax, and even your familiarity with each quoted personality to figure them out. The book also includes an introduction that gives us general hints for solving cryptograms. Two sections with clues on the solution of each puzzle, one stating the occupation and year of birth of the celebrity being quoted and another stating the correct substitution for one or more letters, are included at the back, along with the solutions for each puzzle. An index of authors for those searching for quotes from a particular individual is also included. If you love cryptograms, buy this book. I guarantee that you won't be able to do them just one a day. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
