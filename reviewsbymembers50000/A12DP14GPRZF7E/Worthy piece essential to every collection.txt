 This figure is Toy Biz's take on Gothmog, Sauron's minion in control of the ground troops of his army on the battle against Gondor, as he appears in The Return of the King movie. Although this figure has no special light or sound features, and only a couple of run-of-the-mill accessories, an Orc sword and spear, it's still one of the best figures of the entire Return of the King series. Its sculpt and paint decoration are exceptionally realistic: its features are horrible deformed and its skin gruesomely twisted; its armor is intricately layered, detailed and painted to look old and rusted; and the attention to minutia is so great that the irises of its eyes, the weaving of the fabrics of his clothes, and every single teeth in his mouth can be clearly distinguished. As if that weren't enough, this is also from the "Super Posable" line, and comes with 30 points of articulation - even the fingers on his right hand have separate joints - allowing it a wider variety of movements and positions than a normal figure's. Towering above almost every other figure at an imposing height of 7 1/2 inches, this figure is sure to become a centerpiece on any collection. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
