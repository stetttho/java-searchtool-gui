 Housing a majestic and rich collection of more than 8,600 paintings, 700 sculptures, 5,000 drawings, 2,000 engravings and 3,000 other objects of art, no book, no matter its size, can ever come close to actually visiting Spain's Museo del Prado itself. In that regard, this book is no different. Where this comprehensive book, written by the museum's director, excels other visual guides of its kind is in both the assortment of the works it presents and in its easy-to-browse organization.  Printed in high-quality plates on semi-glossy paper, and bound in a sturdy, pocket-sized format, this little volume superbly reproduces nearly 270 of the museum's most renowned masterpieces. For each item, its author, name, date of creation, materials and dimensions is indicated, and all the pieces are arranged into one of six distinct sections: *Spanish Painting, Sculpture and Drawing *Flemish and Dutch Painting *Italian Painting *French, German and English Painting *Tesoro del Delfn and Decorative Arts *Sculptures As a bonus, a brief look at the museum's history is offered in the Preface and an introduction is given at the beginning of each section on the history of items they include. For fast check-ups, an Index of Illustrations is provided at the back.  For those who have already visited the museum this book is a first-class visual reminder of what you have seen, and for those who have never been to it, it gives a tantalizing glimpse of this vast and remarkable treasure. Enjoy! --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
