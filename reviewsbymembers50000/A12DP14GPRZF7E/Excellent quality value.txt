 This handy and attractive zester comes with very sharp holes set at the perfect angle to make zesting rinds virtually effortless and give you more peel without pith on lemons, oranges and even the toughest of citrus skins. The built in channel knife for garnishing is a convenient addition you can use on chocolate and other foods to produce the perfect decoration every time. Its sharp blades never seem to need sharpening, and its hefty body fits comfortably in the hand, making it require less force to operate than the more traditional zesters do. Like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, this one is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design and big, pressure-absorbing, outstanding non-slip grip, complete an oversized hole for easy hanging, allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use. Its injury-free, elegant, stylized, standard OXO shape will fit perfectly with the rest of your OXO utensils in the kitchen or in the bar. Its easy-to-clean, simple construction and dishwasher-safe, hard-wearing materials make this a tool that you will be able to depend on for years, and its stainless-steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away. After submitting this product to over two years of normal use, mine is still just like new. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
