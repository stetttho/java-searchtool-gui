 This figure is Toy Biz's take on the ever-watchful Eye of Sauron, the disembodied form he took after The One Ring was cut from his hand, as he appears on top of his tower at Minas Morgul in The Return of the King movie. This is the one Lord of the Rings figure that is merely fun. The Eye sits on top of his tower engulfed in flames, and a button on its back lights it up, moves it left and right, and up and down, and activates the recording that grimly proclaims, "I seeeeeeeeeeee yooooooooooou!" Since this is not a "figure" in the traditional sense, it can be displayed with your collection or somewhere else on its own. If you feel like joining in the fun, buy this figure today. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
