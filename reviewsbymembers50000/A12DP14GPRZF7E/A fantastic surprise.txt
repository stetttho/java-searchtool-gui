	 This figure is Toy Biz's take on Frodo as he appears when he faces off Shelob, the giant spider, in The Return of the King movie. With such a close likeness to Elijah Wood, the actor who plays the character in the movie, and such meticulous sculpt and painting, complete with silvery spider webs, dirty clothes, and a panic-sticken yet resolute expression, this figure constitutes one of the best of the complete Return of the King series. Furthermore, it comes with a button hidden under its cape on its back that when pressed, swings up its left arm and activates the Light-Up Action, which makes the Light of Earendil glow strongly and beautifully white. This is by far the coolest light-up feature I have seen on any figure since the Frodo with Light-Up Sting came out a few years back. Although it doesn't come with any accessories, as both Sting and the Light of Earendil are attached to Frodo's hands, it is substantially articulated for a non "Super Posable" figure, and his Elven cape is removable. This is the perfect figure to display with Shelob, and the pair is a must have addition to any serious collection. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
