 Young Guns is a movie about the origins of the legendary Billy The Kid and a handful of deputized outlaws that accompanied him in his adventures. Young Guns II is the great conclusion to Young Guns, so well realized that it outshines its predecessor.  The story begins with the hunt for outlaws promoted by the newly elected governor of New Mexico with the help of handsome government rewards for the capture (dead or alive) of known personalities. Billy The Kid is one of the hunted and Pat Garret, his longtime friend, is made Sheriff to aid in his capture. The outcome of the story is legend.  The cast's performances (Emilio Estevez, William Petersen, Diamond Lou-Phillips, Kiefer Sutherland, Christian Slater, Alan Ruck, Balthazar Getty, James Coburn and Viggo Mortensen) are wonderful and delightful to watch. The characters are very well developed and all of them shine in their own way. The score and soundtrack by Alan Silvestri and Jon Bon Jovi, along with the movie's photography, are breathtaking and work in concert to transport you to a long ago and far away place, making you feel part of the action. The sets and settings accurately depict the period; the showdowns and shot-outs abound, the surprise elements and unexpected plot twists are rewarding and the story is consistently woven into a fascinating tale based on one of the better known legends of the Old West. To enjoy this movie even more I would recommend watching Young Guns (part I) first, a very good movie too, you'll appreciate the character's growth and the pre-established, continued story lines a lot better. This is a must watch for those who like Westerns, like to wear their cowboy hats from time to time, or simply want to enjoy a good, entertaining, action-packed movie. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
