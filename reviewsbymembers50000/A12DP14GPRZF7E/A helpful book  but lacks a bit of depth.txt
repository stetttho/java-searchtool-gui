 This beautifully illustrated guide is an introductory book on the basic drawing techniques needed to accurately depict several cartoon characters from the Spider-man universe in their well-known Marvel Comics style. The information and instructions contained in this book are logically organized and include a list of tools and materials you need to get started, guidelines on how to use the book and some basic information on perspective. It also contains some step-by-step examples on how to draw characters like Spiderman (and Peter Parker), Mary Jane, Black Cat, Daredevil, Venom, Dr. Octopus, Lizard, Mysterio and Vulture.  However, this book lacks information on several topics that include guidelines on basic figure drawing, head and figure proportions, movements and expressions, comparisons of male and female figure features, and perspective and foreshortening for backgrounds and figures. It also lacks some steps on its step-by-step instructions, better explanations on how to reach the finished drawings and a lot more useful advice on detailing the characters. Buy this book only if you can't find any other references on how to draw Spider-man. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
