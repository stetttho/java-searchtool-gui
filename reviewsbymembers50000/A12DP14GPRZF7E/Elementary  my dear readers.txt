 This educational, entertaining and delightful volume provides well-researched answers to interesting questions about the meaning, origin and usage of some of today's most perplexing words and phrases. Compiled from material taken from the author's newspaper and Internet column by the same name, The Word Detective is an informative, witty, charming and fun reference for word lovers, trivia enthusiasts and armchair etymologists alike. Organized alphabetically, irreverently written and often whimsically illustrated, each entry untangles the histories and debunks the myths behind words like jeep, sabotage, busboy and gringo, and phrases like "cup of joe," "armed to the teeth" and "pickled as an owl". You will be thoroughly informed, at the same time that you are smiling, chuckling or laughing with each explanation. Special sections that explore related groups of words and phrases like euphemisms, metaphors, eponyms and figures of speech, among others, are also included. A bibliography and a list of web sites devoted to words and language, especially useful to those interested in pursuing the subject further, are also added at the back of the book. Overall, this book combines the perfect amount of humor and instruction to insure the reader a pleasurable and rewarding experience. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
