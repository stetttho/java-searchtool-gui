 This figure is Toy Biz's take on King Thoden of Rohan as he appears bewitched by Saruman's evil magic in The Two Towers movie. I must admit that I was a bit skeptical about how good this figure could be, as no special features - sound, lights, extra articulations - and no accessories were advertised for it, and two other versions of King Thoden had already been released. But now I believe that this is undoubtedly one of the best figures of the entire Lord of the Rings line. Simple as it is, it still deserves a full 5-star rating for its uncanny resemblance to Bernard Hill, the actor who plays the character in the movie, and its extraordinarily realistic details alone. Its skin is painstakingly wrinkled and its complexion eerily pale; his hair, nails and clothes look dusty and bleak; and the stare delicately painted in its eyes seems as absent and dismal as the actor's does in the movie.  Overall, this figure does for me what few others have accomplished: capture on its own both the mood of the character and that of an entire scene. And it also looks fantastic displayed next to Gandalf the White and Grima Wormtongue as part of any collection. It's a must buy. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
