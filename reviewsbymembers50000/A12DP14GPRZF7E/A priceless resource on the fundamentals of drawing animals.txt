 This book is a clearly written and easy to follow step-by-step guide to drawing animals by applying a comparative anatomy system using geometric shapes to help you understand how animals are put together. This fully illustrated reference contains over a thousand diagrams and illustrations and is structured into twenty carefully organized sections in which the author covers the basic and not-so-basic concepts, principles and techniques you need in order to produce realistic, three dimensional and anatomically accurate renderings of animals.  His topics on specific animals include the cat family, the bear family, the horse family, the elephant, the dog family, the camel, the giraffe, the hippopotamus, the rhinoceros, the deer family, the buffalo, the cow, the pig, the monkey and the ape family, the kangaroo and the rabbit. As an added bonus he includes other topics: Odd and Unusual Animals, Miscellaneous Small Animals and Animal Interpretation and Abstraction, as well as an Introduction to Animal Drawing in which he focuses on animal simplification, structure, construction, poses, gaits and movements, comparisons and techniques on how to make animals look more natural. As a warning, note that this book only explains how to draw mammals and doesn't include mollusks, amphibians, insects, reptiles or birds. By studying this book as if it were a textbook on a course, doing all the exercises and reviewing each section afterwards, I have steadily improved my drawings of animals in such a short time that I am now constantly rewarded with praise from my friends and family. This book will give to the beginner the fundamentals of drawing animals, and will give to the seasoned artist and professional new principles and techniques to try. For both, this book is a must buy. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
