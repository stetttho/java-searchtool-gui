 This well-written and easy-to-understand book answers two hundred of the most interesting, curious and bizarre questions ever published in The New York Times' "Science Q&A" column, giving us an entertaining and informative look at the most fascinating and wonderful inquiries ever posed by inquisitive minds about the world we live in. This compendium includes topics that range from astronomy, biology, anatomy and physics to nutrition, common sense, wilderness survival and even urban legends, all neatly organized in easy-to-browse sections that are delightfully illustrated by the witty and sometimes hilarious drawings that were originally published in the newspaper. As a bonus, the section titled Notes located at the back of the book, lists the source(s) used to answer each question. So, if you want to know whether the are any one-eyed animals or why a magnet loses its power overtime, where dust comes from or why bruises change color, what makes a Mexican jumping bean jump or why spoiled cans of food swell, then this is the book for you. It's a must-read, fact-filled, fun reference for readers of all ages, be it a science enthusiast or just someone who isn't afraid to ask life's most unconventional questions. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
