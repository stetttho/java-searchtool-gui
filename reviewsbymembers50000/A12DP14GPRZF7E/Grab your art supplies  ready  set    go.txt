 This beautifully illustrated, easy to follow, step-by-step, how-to guide is the first book you should buy to learn the basic drawing techniques you need to accurately depict each cartoon character from the Superman universe (in the Bruce Timm/Animated Series style). The information and instructions contained in this book are wonderfully organized and presented in step-by-step format (from rough sketch to finished drawing), include a list of tools and materials you need to get started and cover topics that include: guidelines on basic figure drawing, head and figure proportions, movements and expressions, comparisons of male and female figure features, and perspective and foreshortening for backgrounds and figures. The book also contains a detailed treatment on how to draw each character, including Superman (and Clark Kent), Lois Lane, Martha and Jonathan Kent, Jor-El and Lara, Lex Luthor, Parasite, Bizarro, Mr. Mxyzptlk, Metallo and Brainiac. As a bonus, the book teaches us how to draw settings and accessories like Metropolis, The Daily Planet, guns, cars and Superman's X-Ray and Heat vision. This book is a simple, yet excellent resource on how to create your own adventures for the Man of Steel, at the same time that you begin to understand the basic principles of cartooning and animation.  A must buy for kids and adults who want to draw the Superman universe like professional artists in a relatively short time. If you prefer a more general book on how to draw DC Comics super heroes, I recommend buying How to Draw Batman and the DC Comics Super Heroes by Ty Templeton instead, since it contains around 90% of the characters featured in this book, plus a lot of other characters from other DC Comics universes. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
