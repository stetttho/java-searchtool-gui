 This movie is, without a doubt, the best cinematic adaptation and closest rendition of J. M. Barrie's timeless, ageless fantasy tale about the boy who wouldn't grow up. It's simply perfect from beginning to end. It stays true to the book, but also incorporates a few fresh ideas, that take nothing away from the original story. The actors are superb. Jeremy Sumpter is wonderful as the carefree, adventurous, cocky, yet innocent, Peter Pan, and Jason Issacs perfectly portrays the elegant, sophisticated, obsessive and downright bad Captain Hook. Rachel Hurd-Wood is excellent as Wendy, sharing with us her fears, desires and fantasies as she faces the choices that go hand in hand with growing up. The acting of the rest of the cast, especially the children's, is impressive, and the chemistry between them and the adults shines through on the screen. James Newton Howard's score is simply magical and seamlessly woven into the story and the film's stunning and splendid visuals. Even the special features are great, as they are presented in well-organized, short, little capsules that make them enjoyable and easy to watch even for children. This is the first live-action adaptation of J. M. Barrie's classic, and is such an excellent one that it should remain so for a very long time. It masterfully combines adventure, romance, action and drama with fantastic characters, making it a must-see for both kids and adults. You won't be disappointed. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
