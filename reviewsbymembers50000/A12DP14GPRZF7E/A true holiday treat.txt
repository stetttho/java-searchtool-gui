 Each year without fail, from 1920 to 1939, the children at the Tolkien household received a letter from Father Christmas, telling them of the ludicrous, hilarious events, mishaps and accidents that occurred in the North Pole previous to his yearly visits. Through his emotive letters and amusing drawings, Father Christmas often explained how most of his misfortunes were directly linked to the curiosity of the well-meaning but rather clumsy Polar Bear (who constantly complained of looking very silly in the drawings). He also shared some little-known facts about life in the North Pole like the "mystery" of the Northern Lights, how he manages to visit all the children in the world in a single night, and who are the real Snowmen. This pint-sized, delightful book, colorfully illustrated with the author's own drawings, contains a chronologically arranged selection of these letters that is sure to be enjoyable to readers of all ages. This is definitely another Tolkien volume that you can't afford to miss. --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
