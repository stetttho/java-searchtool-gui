 Decades ago, an author rightly called the Hashemite familys having ruled Mecca for a millennium, almost without interruption, one of the more remarkable phenomena of history. But it did so in obscurity, only to burst onto the world scene with World War I and the Arab Revolt.  For ten glorious years, from the Husayn-McMahon correspondence of 1915-16 (in which London supported Hashemite aspirations to found a pan-Arab caliphate) until the Saudi conquest of Mecca in 1924 (which effectively ended those Hashemite aspirations), the family plausibly laid claim to lead the Arabic-speaking world.  Then failure set in, as the Hashemites lost Syria, the caliphate, Hijaz, and (much later) Iraq.  Only the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, that modest remnant of a great ambition, survived the general collapse.   In a well-designed and lively volume, Tel Aviv Universitys Dayan Center has taken the welcome step of assessing the twentieth-century Hashemite experience as a whole.  It does so in three parts, one each dealing with the Hijaz kingdom, Iraq, and Jordan.  In addition to the more conventional analysis, such as Joseph Nevos exemplary study of King Abdallahs memoirs, several of the essays draw on unusual sources or deal with unusual topics.  Ami Ayalon interprets the Hijaz kingdom via its postage stamps.  Jeffrey A. Rudd (the one non-Israeli essay writer in the volume) finds gold in a protracted British government debate over whether to spell the new countrys name Irak or Iraq, seeing in this a metaphor for basic disagreements on larger issues.  Martin Kramer recounts the peculiar history of Eugï¿½ne Jung, the Hashemites French booster.  Michael Winter shows that Jordanian textbooks before 1967 were among the most radical in the Arab worldnot a little surprising given that countrys moderate politics.
