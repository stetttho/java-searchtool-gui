 Abu-Rabi� finds the origins of fundamentalist Islam lying as much in European colonialism as in Islam.  The latter �is as strong a component�sometimes negative, sometimes positive�in modern Arab societies as the Qur�anic impact on the Arab mind.� To prove his point, the author devotes half his book to the analysis of what he calls the �grandiose exegesis� of Sayyid Qutb, the vituperative Egyptian thinker who helped establish so many of modern fundamentalism�s main features, including its hatred of moderate Muslims and its anti-Semitism.   To say that Abu-Rabi� is sympathetic to Qutb (and several other fundamentalist authors) would be an understatement.  In fact, he serves as their apostle to an English-speaking audience.  For example, he explains Qutb�s concept of intellectual imperialism, segues into his own elaboration of this topic, then returns to Qutb. Author and subject meld into a nearly seamless whole.   The sharp-eyed reader will not be surprised that Abu-Rabi� sanitizes a hateful brand of fundamentalism:  in the book�s acknowledgments, he thanks Ramadan �Abdallah (of the University of South Florida in Tampa) for reading his manuscript.  In October 1995, as this book was in press, Ramadan �Abdallah surfaced in Damascus as Ramadan �Abdallah Shalah, the head of Islamic Jihad, the most murderous anti-Israel outfit anywhere in existence.  As The New York Times headline about this story put it, �Professor Talked of Understanding But Now Reveals Ties to Terrorists.� No, the surprise is not that Abu-Rabi� apologizes for killers; but that the State University of New York Press should print such propagandistic ....
