 Documentsmostly but not exclusively from the United Nationsare the star here, taking up 700 pages.  Implicitly recognizing that the United Nations had only a minor role until the fighting ended in February 1991, nine-tenths of the documents date from the period since then, presenting the sanctions regime in all its military and economic complexity.  They contain very little legalese or U.N. self-importance and lots of substance, including much hard-hitting analysis (a human rights report by Max van der Stoel, for example, cites Iraq as one huge prison).  A reader looking for Boutros-Ghalis few perfunctory introduction lines might look in vain and conclude that they got omitted.  Not so; the secretary-general is credited for the fine 113-page analysis that opens the volume.  Lest it be assumed that this be a courtesy for the U.N.s chief executive, note that he cut his teeth as a professor of international law and, in addition to other books in this same U.N. series, compiled prior such books.   But Boutros-Ghalis text, for all its virtues, is prisoner to the unique U.N. perspective.  The first paragraph lauds that organization for acting as a powerful instrument for international peace and security.  The second presents the Iraqi assault on Kuwait as the first instance since 1945 when one Member State sought to completely overpower and annex anothera bit of revisionist history that ignores other such instances (Israel and Bosnia) where more controversy reigns.
