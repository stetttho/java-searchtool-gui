 Soon after becoming secretary of state, George P. Shultz noted that  unless you do something about it, in the job of secretary of state you will spend 100 percent of your time on the Middle East.  Every Secretary of State becomes a Middle East expert very rapidly, whether he wants to or not, he also stated.  . These observations remain valid today, when Warren Christopher has virtually become Secretary of State for the Middle East.  Baker had a similar experience.  Page one of his memoirs tells of Saddam Husayns invasion of Kuwait, the single most dangerous moment of Bakers three-years-plus as secretary of state.  Of the books thirty-four chapters, fully fifteen concentrate on the Middle East, primarily the Kuwait war and the Arab-Israeli peace process.   Famously discreet when in office, Baker unbuttons a bit in the retelling.  He captures the atmosphere of his endless travels (he went to sleep on the eve of his Geneva meeting with Tariq Aziz, just before the outbreak of hostilities, as the chants from antiwar protesters echoed quietly up to our block of rooms) and the vagaries of dealing with Middle Eastern leaders (Asad treated his complaints about Syrian terrorism the way one might react to an eccentric uncle at family gatheringsas an unavoidable nuisance to be endured politely).  Baker also provides some new information; for example, in March 1991, he raised to Yitzhak Shamir the possibility of stationing U.S. troops on the Golan Heights.  Middle East Quarterly, June 1996
