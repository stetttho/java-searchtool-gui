 Gardells impressive research results in a far richer and more subtle account of the NOI and Farrakhan.  Immersing himself in the writings of the movement and in much else related to it (such as its connections to the FBI, Muammar al-Qadhdhafi, and rap musicians) he has produced an impressively thorough account.  The study usefully covers other NOI branches, including the Lost Found Nation of Islam, the Five Percent Nation of Islam, and the Ansaaru Allah Community.  Heres where to find out about the NOIs tentative moves toward mainstream Islam, its connections to American neo-Nazis, and its challenge to the black Christian churches. Gardells book is highly unusual in one way:  although the author has many strange and tendentious ideas (that Reagan planned for a war on Libya in 1986, that Farrakhan is not an anti-Semite, that a mistress of Elijah Muhammads was his Islamic wife, that the 1992 Rodney King riots were the bloodiest uprising of the twentieth century), he does not slant the evidence but scrupulously offers information that directly disproves his own arguments.  Most readers of In the Name of Elijah Muhammad will want to read the study for its facts while keeping a distance from Gardells conclusions.   Middle East Quarterly, March 1997
