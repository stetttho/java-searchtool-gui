 At first glance, it appears Frankel has written yet another in the sequence of prominent American journalists� books about Israel and the Arabs.  But his book differs from those by David Shipler and Thomas Friedman in two respects:  his topic is not the Arab-Israeli conflict but Israel; and he has a specific thesis that pervades the volume.  The title makes that thesis clear:  by �beyond the promised land,� the author means that Israel is, chrysalis-like, emerging from its Zionist stage (�a small, collectivist, mobilized garrison-state under siege�) and entering something very different (�a more open, pluralistic, bourgeois and democratic country�).  The author welcomes this �new Israel,� as he calls it, arguing that it is �much closer to the benign fate that Herzl and others originally predicted� for the Jewish state. He draws on his three-year residency in Israel during 1986-89 and subsequent trips to the country to produce a lively, chronologically-oriented argument to back up this thesis, one inspired by an affection for and a familiarity with his subject matter.   So far, so good.  But Frankel�s account suffers a fault that suffuses the book and much reduces its value:  he has an acutely partisan view of Israeli politics, admiring Labor and nearly despising Likud.  In a typical passage, he terms the change of government in 1992 the ending of �right-wing Likud domination� and �a return to the more pragmatic, less ideological rule of the left-of-center Labor Party.� "Beyond the Promised Land" would have been a much better book had the author reigned in his prejudices.
