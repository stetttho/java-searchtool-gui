 Singh seeks to understand the causes of Farrakhan's rise and its implications for the United States; religion and worldview have only the slightest importance for this author, whereas black American politics are paramount.  Although shakey on the Nation of Islam (referring mistakenly to its seven daily prayers and female Fruit of Islam guards) and also on conservative politics in the United States (thinking Farrakhan shares important features with Jesse Helms  and Ronald Reagan), Singh has a thorough grasp of American racial politics and a clear sense of his subject's place in them.  Correctly, he de-emphasizes the importance of antisemitism to Farrakhan's message  while placing much greater emphasis on his vituperative attacks on other black leaders.  These are based on the leaders' social liberalism, which is so much out of tune with the electorate's conservatism:  "Farrakhan's popular appeals are also in part based upon his persistent exploitation of the disjunctures between elite black attitudes and popular African-American beliefs." In Singh's view, the Nationa of Islam's (NOI) religious doctrines and Farrakhan's eclectic theological claims are most appropriately regarded as merely an embellishment of more fundamental traditionalist and populist political tenets."  Arguing against those who see Farrakhan as a media creation, Singh points to his having built up a large constituency without help from the mainstream newspapers and television.  He concludes from this that the best way to fend off Farrakhan's ugly and threatening influence is "to accord him the opportunity-and even the responsibility-for implementing effective political, economic, and social change." However scary this course, the author maintains, it is the best way to call a demagogue's bluff.   Middle East Quarterly, December 1998
