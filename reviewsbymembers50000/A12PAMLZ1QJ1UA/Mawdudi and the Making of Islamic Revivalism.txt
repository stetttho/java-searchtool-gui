 Nasr makes large claims for his biographee, Sayyid Abul-Ala Mawdudi (1903-79), founder of the fundamentalist Jamaat-i Islami (JI) organization, deeming him without doubt the most influential of contemporary Islamic revivalist thinkers. And he says the JIabout which he wrote an earlier companion volume, The Vanguard of the Islamic Revolution -- influenced Islamic revivalism from Morocco to Malaysia and controlled the expression of revivalist thinking in Southwest Asia and South Asia since 1941. Large claims, to be sure, but Nasr easily shows just how consequential the man and his movement have been.   Nasr has written a most sophisticated analysis; perhaps its key has to do with Mawdudis complex mix of the Islamic and the Western.  Typical was his notion of an Islamic state, which drew in large part on Western notions:  His debate with Western political thought was antagonistic, but it also assimilated Western ideas into his interpretation of Islam and the Islamic state. More broadly, he sought to transform Islam by making it more operational:  Mawdudi called Muslims back to Islam but to an Islam that was rationalized and streamlined so that its social expression would be able to support a viable political order.  Though himself frustrated in the pursuit of power, Mawdudis ideas provided much of the means by which Khomeini did ride to power, and that many other fundamentalists are still using in their challenge to the state.
