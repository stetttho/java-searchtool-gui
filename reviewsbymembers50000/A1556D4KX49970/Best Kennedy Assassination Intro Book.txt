 4.5 Stars: I read this book when it came out I believe in the early ninties and have re-read the newest version with the updates. This is the best book for those who are new or want to be introduced into the Kennedy Assassination Theories. Marrs' does a good job in researching and compiles others research into the matter in an organized manner.
