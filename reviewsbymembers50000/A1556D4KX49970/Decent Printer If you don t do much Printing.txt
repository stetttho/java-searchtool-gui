 I have seen the 1 star reviews and I am sure they are probably right, but if you don't print much, this is a ok budget printer.  I've had no problems with it in the 6 months I've had it but then again, I print like maybe 5 pages per month.  It's a good printer if you need to provide a printer to your grandma or someone who uses a printer not much.
