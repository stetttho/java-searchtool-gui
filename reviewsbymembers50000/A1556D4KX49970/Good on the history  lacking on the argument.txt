 Although it is hard for the average person to accept the theories of this book in reference to the aide in the creation of the United States and other Western events, the book lays out the 'other side' of history that many historians acknowledge but which does not make it into the history books. The knowledge of history and the backing up of facts in this book is very good,but the arguments are very lacking.  The problem with the arguments are that you can sense an underlying distaste of the government by the author which somewhat lends to bias.  He makes good historical theories, but from his expereince vs. the US Goverment, he tends to indulge his 'hatred' in his offerings. Although the flaw in logic of the arguments, I would still recommened this book based on the historical research which many people in the world are not privy to.
