 Icke researches his theories well in this book and backs them up with historical facts.  Great book for the novice or expert in the realm of world power structure and government bodies.  The only roadblock to many readers with this book will be Icke's 'Lizard' theory which I took more as metaphor than fact(even though he claims it as fact in the book).  If you can get by that or even accept it in soem way, the book is filled with valuable information that many readers probably are not aware of.  Some theories seemed far fetched but you have to take the conventional with the non-conventional in this book.  The amount of organized research and information is one reason I would recommend this book.
