 3.5stars:  After reading some of the negetive reviews of this book here on amazon, I must say that some people are taking this book too seriously.  This is a good book if you are a conspiracy buff or even someone who likes to explore alternative history.  The historical background in this book is excellent and that would be the main reason I would recommened it.  As for believeing Marrs theories, it is up to the reader to decide.  Either you can accept them at face value or take them as fiction.  I don't understand why a book like this has to be vilified by others, unless it is so threatening to their world view.  Conspiracy buffs will love this book, and non-conspiracy types will be introduced to some new information.  A healthy amount of skeptism for whatever kind of book you like will make this an enjoyable read.
