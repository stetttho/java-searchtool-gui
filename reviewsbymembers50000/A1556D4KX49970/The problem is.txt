 the problem with books like this and people reading them is that you can't take comtemporary thought and apply it to the past.  It was a harsh world back then, and not everything was PC like it is today.  The real truth may hurt, but it's still the truth when you do the research.  And this goes both ways, where contrary to what they teach in schools, in realty, villians were actually heros and heros were actually villians.  You can't take the mainstream beliefs of today and apply them to the past.
