 Madden2003 , NFL2K, good games yes, but the best game out of the bunch this year : NCAA 2003. Why? Unlike the pro game, ncaa 2003 gives you the atmosphere of the college expereince.  The game is much improved from last years (great game also) by including more modes and an open sense of play than the pro games do.   Greatest thing about ncaa 2003 : VAREITY!!!  There are over 117 teams, and guess what, you can even make your own school in the game, complete with building your own stadium, designing your own uniforms, etc...  If you are like me, who's alma mater had cancelled their football program, well you can revive them back to life!  Even without using create a school option, all the conferences and teams and unique stadiums are included in this game.  Also there is a extra rivarly mode so you can play ohio st vs michigan/ oklahoma vs nebraska, etc... Gameplay wise, ncaa2003 moves with a quick pace.  Since the college game moves faster with its' play clock, you will need to make quick decsiions on the plays you will be selecting and then execute them.   Also, the big play makes a major appearance in this game.  Just like true college ball, big plays make or break a season.  This is also true in this titel as well. Now to the Dynasty mode : excellent.  I love this mode since every year, you have to upgrade your team since you will have players either graduating or going to the pro's.  It really makes you use the dynasty mode since one year you can be #1 and the next lose half your team to the pro's and drop down to #25.  Recruiting is also fun since you have to research the skills of the high school players ready to make the next step to college football. All in all this is a FUN game.  Also the ability to download roster updates from the internet and importing draft classes into madden 2003 makes the longevity of this game solid.
