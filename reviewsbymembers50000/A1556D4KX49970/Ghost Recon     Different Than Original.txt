 If you loved Ghost Recon 1, you may not like the sequel.  GR1 was a stealth and tactical military type game, where you needed to be at the right positions, at the right angles, and make your moves at the precise moment.    GR2 is totally different.  Although it may have some tactical and stealth elements, it's more like the Socom series than the GR series.  You can call it a mix between halo and socom since most of the time it's just shooting than strategy.  If you like a game like Socom, you'll love GR2.  But if you liked GR1, you may want to rent this before you buy.
