 A few things you should know first about Mortal Kombat : Shaolin Monks:  1.First and foremost, this IS NOT a fighting game.  This is an action/adventure game. 2.If you are looking to buy this game for your kids, you may think twice.  There is a lot of blood and gore with this game and it may not be for the squemish either.  But thats Mortal Kombat for you :)   Let me say that I hate, hated , will always hate fighthing games.  But there always has been one exception : MORTAL KOMBAT.  The MK story, characters, secrets, and other things that set this series apart from the rest is what made me a big fan of the series.    So what Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks (MKSM) does is take all those great MK characters from the fighting games and puts them into an action adventure game.  And the game really is very fun to play.  The best thing is the non stop action.  There is never a dull moment in this game.  You're constantly on the move to try to defeat enemies, solve puzzles, and accomplish missions.  It takes an old school method, ko-op fighting and turns it into an awesome next-gen experience.  You start off with Liu Kang or Kung Lao and pick up characters along your journey.  The story is almost like Lord of the Rings in terms of being based on old world stories.  The graphics for the xbox version are beautiful.  Sometimes you have to pause the screen just because you're in awe of the visuals.  The characters look great, and the backgrounds, buildings, the whole game looks great.  The sound is terffic too, but they MK has always had terrific sound.  The blood, gore, fatalies, hidden secrets, all of it is there.  The game is a joy to play.
