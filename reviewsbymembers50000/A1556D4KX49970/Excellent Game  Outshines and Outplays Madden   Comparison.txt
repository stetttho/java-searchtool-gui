 If you ever wondered what Madden would be like if they fixed all the problems as they promise us every year but never do, ESPN NFL 2K5 would be it.  First of all, in ESPN 2K5 , you can't drop back 30 yards and complete passes in triple coverages in this game like madden.  You have to know the aspects of your quarterback as in real life and take the right amount of step dropbacks and release the ball on time to open recievers.  If you do the 30 yard madden like dropbacks, you will be sacked.  Also, in ESPN NFL 2K5 there is no 'mario running' in this game like madden.  If you go in the middle of the line, you won't just get stuck there as you do in madden.  The running backs will actually follow their blockers!  Yes, believe it, after years of playing madden, ESPN 2K5 actually does this.  Defense is exciting to play as well.  The game will be very hard at first because the cpu will actually play defense against you.  Unlike madden, in espn nfl 2k5, the cpu will not cheat and know where the pass is going before it's even in the air.  Mostly, you, the player will be in charge of making all the plays on defense.  This is the most realistic football game I've ever played.  The cpu will actually play you tough and you won't be getting those 82-72 games like you do in madden.  If you like high scoring arcade football , buy madden.  If you like real NFL simulation football, buy ESPN NFL 2K5.  AT at 20 bucks, you can't really go wrong with this game.
