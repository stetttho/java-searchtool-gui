 This book has a lot of good information especially to those new to this subject, but the organization of the book is all over the place.    The author mixes too much new age with science with mythology sometimes in the wrong places which makes the book very hard to take.  I would have liked this book more if the author stuck less with the new age and went more with the link between science and mythology.  If one is a beginner in this subject, I'd rather recommend Fingerprints of the Gods by Ghrahm Hancock.  Hancock's book is much more consice and does a great job in linking science and mythology with emerging new theories.   Lost Star is a little too much New age for me.
