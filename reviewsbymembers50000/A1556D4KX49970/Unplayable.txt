 Last year, NCAA2004 was the best football game, and possibly the best football game ever made.  This year, well it's another story.  First of all, there is tons of slowdown in this game which makes it unplayable.  Sometimes, it's as if you playing in slow motion.  Graphically, the game takes a step back from last year.  The uniform colors are less detailed, the stadiums look like they need a paint job, and the grass/ turf colors are horrible.  The whole game has  a dull and washed out look to it.  Gameplay wise, the Home Field Advantage is cool at first, but gets really old really fast.  They made passing harder but most of the time, the computer will get beat on long passes.  Also, when you play defense, if you play a zone coverage every play, the computer offense WILL NOT score on you, even if they are a high powered offense like USC.    The cpu only scores on long bombs and those seem to be random.  The cpu never runs the ball and there is really no short passing game since your zone defense kills their offense.  Its a very disapointing game this year since the last 3 years it was the best game on the market.  I dont know why they decided to mess up a good franchise but ncaa2005 is very unplayable.
