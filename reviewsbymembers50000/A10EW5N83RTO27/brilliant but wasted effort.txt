 When these books come along, the product of intense scholarship and unbelievable objectivity I always want to weep.  Few will read this book, especially not the millions of believing Christians who are living a lie.  They believe the New Testament tells the truth but it actually is designed to conceal the truth.  Eisenman has the truth about what early Christianity really was and the fact that it can more validly be found today in some version of Shiite Islam than in any Christian or Jewish community.  But who would want to see Christianity in Shiite Islam?  We hate Shiite Islam, even though it preserves more of the real Jesus community than any Christian church on earth.  Biblical scholarship has performed wonders in 400 years and few have taken it seriously.  Religion declines for other reasons.  But any reason for the decline of religion is better than none.  Meanwhile people like Eisenman pursue their lonely course.  God bless them.
