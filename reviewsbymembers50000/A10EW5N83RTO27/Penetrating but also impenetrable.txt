 A study not of the activities but the ideas of those who tried to kill Hitler in 1944 will disappoint those not wanting an intellectual history of anti-Hitler individuals and groups.  From Mommsen's research it becomes clear that those who finally could bring themselves to oppose Hitler even with violent action were not typical Germans.  Typical Germans had pretty much by the early 1940's come to support Hitler's regime.  These opponents were aristocrats mostly with a smattering of those from other strata of German society, men fearful of what Hitlerism really meant for Germany and Europe.  They were little concerned with the niceties of Western liberal values and were not especially motivated against the extreme anti-Semitism of National Socialism.  Mostly long hostile to the Weimar Republic and dedicated to third or fourth ways between Fascism, Communism, and Liberalism the anti-Hitler movement was on the other hand all too German in its thought and expression.  As admirable as these men were, most of whom were executed by the Nazis in 1944 and 1955, they were also very, very German in their abstruse reactions to the history of European life and thought.  They knew in the end how to die nobly but they had nevertheless significantly contributed to the horrors of the evil regime they finally decided to seek to destroy.  Even in turning against Hitler they demonstrated the pathological nature of German life and thought. Germans and Germany remain a mystery.  How educated and aristocratic Germans could welcome Hitler remains a mystery.  How they thought they could think to replace him with impractical alternatives also remains puzzling.
