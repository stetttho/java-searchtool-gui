 Like almost all biblical scholars Ehrman fails in his final and most important task:  to tell it like it is, which is to tell the reader that what most Christian churches teach cannot be what Jesus intended.  Jesus' purposes and meaning may remain obscure but it is entirely likely, nay, it is certain, that the Ebionites, the Jewish -Christian followers of Jesus, were closest to what he intended.  The kind of Christianity that won out is the farthest possible from what Jesus had in mind.  That raises the obvious conclusion but it needs to be said in red letters:  Christianity is a fraud!  Period.  Too bad Ehrman does not have the courage, the cojones, to say this clearly.  It is not enough to lead your Christian sheep to the water.  You must make them drink.
