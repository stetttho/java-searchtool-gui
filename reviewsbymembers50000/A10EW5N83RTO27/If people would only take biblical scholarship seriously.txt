 I just emailed Prof. Ehrman that had I been a biblical scholar, rather than an ordinary historian, I would have been tempted to commit suicide.  Why?  For 400 years, at least since Spinoza, it has been clear that what the bible says (Old and New Testament alike) is not the truth but propaganda.  Christians however do not read scientific biblical scholarship; they only read -- if indeed they read at all -- denominationally approved apologetics.  What most Christians believe about Jesus (teachings, life, death, resurrection, purposes, atonement) is totally wrong.  The closest to Jesus was his brother James and the Jewish Christians groups who were either destroyed or marginalized after the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and the dominance of the pagan gentile part of the Jesus group.  The Jewish Christians did not believe in Paul's theology, in John's claim that Jesus was divine, in Jesus as anything but a prophet.  This makes the Islamic view of Jesus probably more acurate than any Christian view of Jesus.  Do Christians hate Jews so much that what the Jewish followers of Jesus believed can be totally rejected, as it has been by every Christian church?  Yes, yes, yes.  Christians refuse to believe the Jews and the extremists among them -- like the Nazis -- even claimed Jesus was not a Jew.  The key here is Jew-hatred, the original sin of Christianity.  Let's face it:  with Bart Ehrman's popular but fully scholarly discussion of the New Testament we can conclude:  Christianity at best is a terrible misunderstanding, at worst a fraud.
