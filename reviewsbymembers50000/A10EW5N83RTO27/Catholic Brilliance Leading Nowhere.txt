 Hilaire Belloc and his Catholic associates, men like G.K.Chesterton, Maurice Baring, Ronald Knox, lived at a time when liberalism seemed doomed and Catholicism, with Thomism, Ultramontanism, and a "third way" between Capitalism and Socialism seemed on its way to reconquer Europe.  Never since the medieval period had so much intelligence and activity been expended on behalf of re-Catholicization, and the number of converts to the Church among Protestants, Jews, and agnostics was impressive.  As it turned out, however, this was less a Catholic revival than the last twitching before Catholicism entered its long decline, the effects of which we still see today. A book about Belloc, who used his considerable talents in what ultimately was a lost cause, should have done something with the peculiar atmosphere of English Catholicism at the end of the 19th and the start of the 20th Century.  Instead Pearce prefers to engage essentially in amiable gossip.  There is not much here one cannot already find in books about Belloc & Co.  The peculiar atmosphere of English Catholicism in the modern period is better approached through Evelyn Waugh's "Brideshead Revisited" than here.   I think perhaps Pearce deserves a comment once made about Belloc himself:  he writes too much to have time for thought.
