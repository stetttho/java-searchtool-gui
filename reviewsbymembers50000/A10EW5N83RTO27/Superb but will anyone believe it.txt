 Apparently there is no amount of scholarship which will convinced the prejudiced.  Kamen superbly shows how the number of victims of the Spanish Inquisition have been exaggerated to serve the cultural and religious  interests of Jews, Protestants, liberals, haters of Spain, and so on.  But  the old views still prevail.  One still reads in newspapers, for instance,  that tens of thousands of Jews were killed by the Inquisition.  Actually  the Inquisition did not have authority over Jews.  It killed, according to  Kamen, about three Christians (real or crypto) every year from the early  16th century until its near demise at the end of the 18th century.  It  makes one sad to see that scholarship cannot overcome prejudice.  Another  area Kamen demolishes is the idea that vast numbers of Jews lived in Spain   before 1492 and vast numbers left for other climes.  Actually there were  never very many Jews in Spain and in the 14th and 15th Century most became  Christian.  It seems to me that Spain  demonstrates the right way to end  religious chaos, by turning the screws on Jews to make them turn Christian.   Eventually even crypto Jews became good Catholics.  Had this been done  with Spanish dedication elsewhere in Europe there would have been no Jewish  problem for Hitler to exploit.
