 This is clearly the least successful of the three Trotsky books by Deutscher.  Only a theologian could enjoy the ins and outs of Marxist theory as Trotsky sought to understand why he had lost out to Stalin and whether he might regain his position.  While Trotsky was indeed unarmed except for theory and theology, Stalin was armed with bureaucratic and state and party power.  Stalin knew better than Trotsky how to win a fight but he also knew that Trotsky was a better Marxist and he appropriated Trotsky's program of peasant collectivization and the subjection of the working class to needed primitive socialist accumulation and rapid industrialization.
