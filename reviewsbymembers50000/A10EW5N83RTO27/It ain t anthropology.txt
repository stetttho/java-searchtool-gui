 One looks here in vain for anything about the anthropology of the Jews, or indeed for anything not found in thousands of books already.  What we get instead is a prosaic account of how the Jews have been mistreated for centuries (they have!) and how much they deserved better (they did!).  This doesn't really contribute much in any case. If one read fewer publishers' blurbs, one would buy fewer bad books.
