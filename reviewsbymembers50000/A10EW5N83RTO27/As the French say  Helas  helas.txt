 A superb demolition of the radical biblical scholarly world.  However, it is written in such a boring, academic way that those who most need to read it will not.  I wish those on the right side of things were as talented as those on the wrong side.  Liberals and radicals always have an edge:  utopian ideas are always exciting; the truth is usually boring.  Congratulations to Prof. Jenkins but perhaps he or someone else could have done a more effective job of showing that Religious Studies should be more correctly called Irreligious Studies.
