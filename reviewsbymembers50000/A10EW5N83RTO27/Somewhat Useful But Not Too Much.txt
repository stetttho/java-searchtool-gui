 This is for anyone familiar with the England of James I and his immediate predecessors a disappointment.  But perhaps I should have paid attention to the title, God's Secretaries.  The Book is about this strange group of men who retranslated the Tyndale Bible but actually made only small changes.  It does not deal with a much more important issue, exactly how decisions on translation were made, but the source material is lacking here. The chief attraction then and now of this particular Bible translation is that it is understandable enough for those wanting the meaning of the Scriptures but archaic enough for aesthetic needs and inspiration.
