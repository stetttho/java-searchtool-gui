 Vol. II is not up to the standards of Vol. I.  Its prose is painful, there are many errors (constant misspelling of Kharkov in the Soviet Union), the explanations of important decision are prosaic.  Kershaw does not a good handle on Hitler's inner workings here as he did in the earlier volume.  Of course the earlier subject, why Hitler was the way he was, is much more interesting.  Here Hitler is simply robot-like doing what he said he would do and finally failing.  But one thing does come clear to me.  I used to think that any nation could fall for a Hitler-type under the right circumstances.  Kershaw has led me to conclude -- and this is probably not his intent -- that there is something inherently weird about the German people who could follow Hitler because they essentially approved of much of his objectives if not of all his methods.  There is something wrong with the Germans -- it is not all Hitler's fault.  There is something wrong with their military, intellectual, industrial, and cultural elites; their is something wrong with the way their nation has developed, how it has 'germanized' Christianity and western thought in a diabolic direction.  In short, I am convinced that Hitler was possessed by evil -- the Devil if you will -- and that most of the German people gave itself willingly into the hands of diabolic evil.  Kershaw has little to say about this because history narrowly interpreted cannot really answer fundamental questions.  In fact, it cannot really answer any questions.  History can only be understood from outside of History itself.  A Hitler and the Germans who followed him can only be understood as the breaking out of satanic activity from the prisons of hell, allowed by God for a time and a season.  I think perhaps I will stop reading about Hitler and the Germans; I have learned all I am likely to learn.
