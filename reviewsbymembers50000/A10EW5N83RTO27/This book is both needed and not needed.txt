 This book rehashes the thesis that Jesus was first and formost an apocalyptic prophet, a very reasonable conclusion to draw from centuries of scholarship and a close reading of the bible.  However there is no reason  to believe that this book will be any more persuasive than many others in  the past in convincing people of something they do not wish to be convinced  of.  Granted Ehrman has a writing style which could appeal to a general  audience but the bible thumpers who need to read this book wouldn't touch  it with a ten foot pole.
