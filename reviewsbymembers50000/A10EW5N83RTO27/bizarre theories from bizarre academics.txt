 Just take Prof. Heschel, the daughter of a distinguished rabbi and scholar.  She finds Gibson's movie anti-feminist.  That's a hoot, considering that traditional Judaism was anti-feminist.    Some good ideas here, a lot of nonsense by axe-grinding academics.  What is clear is that Gibson is 150% a Catholic medieval type.  No one here has a good explanation why this appealed to Protestant fundies and bigots who don't give a hoot about the Stations of the Cross or the Virgin Mary.
