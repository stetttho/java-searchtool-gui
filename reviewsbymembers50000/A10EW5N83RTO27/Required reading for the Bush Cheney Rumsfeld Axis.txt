 This book is required reading for the Bush administration since it demonstrates how foolish regime change, nation building, and the export of unexportable ideas can be.  Forget the arrogant Poles, the treacherous Romanians, the pompous Greeks and Italians, the suave but deceitful Czechs, and the other petitioners before the Big Four, really the Big Three, at Versailles/Paris in 1919.  The real culprits who prepared the world for another world war within two decades were Woodrow Wilson, David Lloyd George, and Georges Clemenceau.  With thoughtlessness, ignorance, lack of consistency and lack of integrity these leaders of the great powers made a mockery of peacemaking.  Blessed indeed are the peacemakers but these three clowns deserved damnation. A very good book, with entertaining anecdotes when appropriate and good judgments generally, it fails in one important respect.  After showing how outrageous an operation the peacemaking was, Margaret Macmillan still has the foolishness to call the treaty with Germany not unfair and not the cause of much woe in the next three decades.  What this demonstrates is that good research and intelligence are not enough to keep an author absolutely from stultifying nonsense.  Anyone who does not see in the Versailles treaty the absolute certainty of disaster does not deserve in the last analysis to be taken seriously.
