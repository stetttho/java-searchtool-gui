 This is a devastating and completely believable expose of the role of the neo-conservative movement in the disasters of Bush's foreign policy adventures.While avoiding religiously any implication that the neo-conservatives constitute a conspiracy of neo-Trotskyite, neo-Leninist, and neo-Zionist intriguers -- after all they do not want any more vicious neo-conservative targeting than they would in any case get -- the authors provide enough subtile evidence that the neo-cons are not just another pressure group.  They have conspired to redirect American foreign policy and they succeeded with the Bush Administration.   The next time you see on Fox News the smiling face of William Kristol, the scowling face of Charles Krauthammer, the sinister Machiavellian grin of Paul Wolfowitz, or the mephistophelian scorn of Richard Cheney you will know that they are not and have not worked in the interests of American security and welfare.  Anti-imperialistic Republicans, like the authors here and yours truly, will hope the book can help to drive the neo-cons from power and influence.  Perhaps only a November repudiation of Bush et al. can accomplish this.
