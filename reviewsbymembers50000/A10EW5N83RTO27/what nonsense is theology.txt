 The entire enterprise of theology -- attempting to explain a God whom even religion notes is beyond understanding -- is by definition ridiculous and nonsense!  What to say here?  Simply this.  The argument of Barth and Hauerwas against natural theology is simply a way of making irrational religion impervious to rational critique.  If you start by saying that Christianity is not based on nature, then what is it based on?  Barth/Hauerwas would say revelation.  But revelation is simply the delusion of old Jews and Greeks, who had no more notion of what God was or might be than the man in the moon.  Thus revelation is baloney and so is Hauerwas and even Barth, for all Barth's intellectual distinction.  It is time to call a spade a spade:  theology is nonsense.
