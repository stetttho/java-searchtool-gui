 A very interesting book for those not familiar with the problems of biblical scholarship in the face of mindless faith and superstition.  But Shorto is much too concerned about being fair, thus he gives too much benefit of doubt to conservative bible-thumpers.  He should be more honest and tell the bible-thumpers that they are crazy, ignorant, redneck fools.
