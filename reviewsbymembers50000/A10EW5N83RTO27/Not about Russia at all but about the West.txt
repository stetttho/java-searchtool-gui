 I'm not quite finished but find the book stimulating and useful.  I suspect the title and subtitle are there to garner readers who would not read yet another book about liberalism and marxism.  But the book is really  about European ideas and not about Russia.  Russia is seen through the  ideas of Europe.  That is not a criticism of the book, only a criticism of  its marketing and packaging.
