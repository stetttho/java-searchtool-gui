 Garry Wills must be writing too much.  One of his recent books, the one on St. Augustine, received much deserved praise.  His book on the necessary evil of big government was a diatribe for liberalism and a shameful support  of tyranny, since the best explanation for the horrors of Nazi Germany is  the power of the State.  We might have expected a man of Wills' talent to  produce the book about the papacy we need, expecially Catholics.  Papal  Catholicism is not real Catholicism; the emphasis on the popes and their  every word and deed is a relatively modern development, the result of the  French Revolution's assault on Christianity and of the disastrous First  Vatican Council (well exposed by Wills).  Catholics need to realize that  the essence of Catholicism is not the eunnuch-like personalities of most  popes but the robust masculinity of Christian heroes and saints.  Wills  does a good job of revealing the heroic stature of Augustine, but his  expose of papal sin is too one-sided, too selective.  Yes, Pius IX was an  hysteric and an intriguer, but not all his denunciations in his Syllabus of  Errors were misguided.  Who can say after the horrible 20th Century that he  was wrong about the evils of democracy, liberalism, statism, and yes even  bible societies!  By tarring the papacy with too wide a brush Wills has  made it certain that Catholics will ignore this book and only anti-Catholic  bigots will like it.  Garry Wills could have done much better, he is  capable of doing much better.
