 Prof. Ehrman is milking his cow for all she's worth and that's ok.  Here he largely elaborates and paraphrases on things he has already written about.  But when you are battling 2000 years of what I call the criminal conspiracy of Christianity you need to repeat yourself again and again.  Here is what is missing, however.   Forget Mary and Peter.  The most important people are James the brother of "the LORD," and Saul of Tarsus, Paul to y'all.  James led the early church and his followers knew Jesus first hand.  The Gospels go out of their way to write James and the early Jewish-Christian church out of the story; later the church declared them heretics.  Can you imagine!  Those who knew Jesus best are thrown out and condemned!  Paul/Saul never met Jesus.  He had hallucinations about his role in persecuting Christians and this led to his inventing a Jesus of his desire, a Jesus of his imagination, a divine being of some sort, influenced both by Hellenistic and late Judaic speculations.  The Church accepted the un-historical novels we call the Gospels and the letters of Paul which tell us nothing about the real Jesus.  That, folks, is the real story.  That is why Christianity is a hoax and the Church a criminal conspircy.
