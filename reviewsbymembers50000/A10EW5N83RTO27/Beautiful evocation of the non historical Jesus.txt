 This is not about the historical Jesus, the author admits as much early on.  And that is precisely the problem with this book.  It is beautifully written, emotionally elevating, inspiring and great.  But it is flawed by two essential facts.  Garry Wills writes about the Jesus in whom he believes, not the historical -- that is, the real Jesus.  He writes about the Jesus of his desire, of his imagination, not the apocalyptic figure who expected and was disappointed by God's absence in the crucifixion of his people and was crucified in their stead.  Wills indicts Christianity -- including his own Roman Church and Pope -- for abandoning Jesus but he never asks why the Church (or churches) has abandoned Jesus.  Clearly Jesus was abandoned when the Church declared that his earliest followers led by his brother James of Jerusalem were heretics.  Early on, therefore, the real Jewish Jesus was rejected in favor of a mystical Jesus of Paul's imagination and John's Jesus of divine pre-existence.  Isn't it obvious that the followers of James "the brother of the Lord" knew the most about Jesus.  Rejecting them meant rejecting Jesus -- and all the subsequent scandal follows from that.  As an historian Wills has an obligation to the facts of history.  He refuses this obligation.  We must therefore, despite his many talents and virtues, refuse him our adherence.
