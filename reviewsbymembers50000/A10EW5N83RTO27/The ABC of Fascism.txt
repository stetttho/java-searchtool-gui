 This book admirably summarizes a vast literature on Fascism and highlights a few key points which can be kept in mind when the threat of Fascism is imagined or raised.    1. Fascism cannot be understood only from its ideologues, it needs to be looked at in practice. 2. The practice of Fascism, as indeed the rise to power of Fascism, requires collaboration and support from the much older, stronger, and more respectable conservative and establishmentarian foundations of any society. 3. Because Fascism is designed to prevent leftist revolution it is profoundly conservative, but because its means are radical it cannot really remain conservative in practice. 4. Because Fascism is conservative it does not require much in the way of terror, intimidation, or violence to capture the acquiescence and cooperation of large segments of society, particularly of "respectable" society.  It does its evil under the cover of the good and the conventional. 5. Therefore Fascism's evil can be hard to discover until it is too late.  Paxton also provides a list of the "mobilizing passions" of Fascism which can be looked for in any society.  It is here that one can in contemporary America, for example, analyze the ranting and raving of talk-show hosts, the unconventional and radical goals of foreign policy experts, the manipulation of patriotic appeals, and the apocalyptic appeals of popular religiosity to discover whether Fascism has entered the national life or not.  The Fascist label can be used indiscriminately and falsely, but it is possible that at the present time it ought to be used more insightfully.  But it ought indeed to be used!
