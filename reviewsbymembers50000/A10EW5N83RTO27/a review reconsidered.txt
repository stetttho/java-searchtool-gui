 I have already submitted and had published an on-line review but I wonder if a revision is permitted me?  I had praised the book but had wondered if the author's clear preference for the interpretation of Lucy Dawidowicz  was not a failure of nerve on his part.  I now have a different feeling  about this.  The last chapter, the one on Dawidowicz, finds the only  possible explanation of Hitler in his love of evil.  Rosenbaum whether he  realizes it or not is saying in effect that Hitler was a manifestation of  the Devil.  I find this explanation  both satisfying and unsatisfying.  It  is unsatisfying because it is an admission of failure, the Devil being the  cause of evil when no other cause is found.  But satisfying since no other  cause has been found for Hitler.  Thus perhaps Rosenbaum is right.   Dawidowicz herself did not focus on the Devil but this is the result of her  and Rosenbaum's discussion.  Hitler then is only explicable if at all as  the Devil or one of his servants.  I'll buy it.
