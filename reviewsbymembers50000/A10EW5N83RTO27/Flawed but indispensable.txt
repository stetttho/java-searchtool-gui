 A sort of who-dunnit about the life and death of Grigorii Rasputin, the chief adviser of the last Tsaritsa and her feckless husband Nicholas II, this book is unfortunately poorly written or translated.  But it is indispensable for understanding why the Tsarist regime had to come to an end.  It was headed by a dynasty which had not shown talent or integrity for over one hundred years, by political leaders and social aristocrats mired in treachery, deceit, immorality, and self-promotion.  The Russian Church was a hollow institution, forcing truly religious people to seek God in other ways, including the curiously sectarian ways of Rasputin himself.  The masses of people were mired in superstition and ignorance, as well as poverty.  Russia seemed like a great power but its strength was only theoretical.  The 1917 Revolution did not unfortunately bring into being something entirely better -- but under the Communists at least living standards and educational standards rose and Russia was able to do what the Tsars could not do, namely save Russia from invasion and ignominious defeat.  Rasputin here emerges as a man one can even sympathize with:  he was ethical in his own way, sympathetic to the people, against the First World War which he foretold would destroy the dynasty.  He did not seem to share the vicious anti-semitism of his church and the Russian elites.  His murderers were effete, dissolute aristocrats, a Romanov and a Yusupov, who surpassed in evil even Rasputin.  One even comes away with sympathy for that unhappy Tsaritsa Alexandra, even for her stupid and mean-spirited husband -- at least compared to the other Romanovs who were probably much worse.  This should be the definitive word on Rasputin.  His immoral adventures are only a small part of the important story but that has amused readers more than the truth.  Probably that will continue.  Pity.
