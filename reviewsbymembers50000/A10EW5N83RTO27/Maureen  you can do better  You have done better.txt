 Maureen Dowd is great when she dissects the misdeeds of the Bush and Cheney families, families which show arrogance and ignorance as their chief characteristics.  But here she gets into the sterile and overdone nonsense about the battle of the sexes.  Sex is inteesting but the battle between feminists and anti-feminists is not.  She is slightly amusing here, especially when she talks about herself and her Irish family, but the overall topic is a bore.  I hope she will return to the political realm.
