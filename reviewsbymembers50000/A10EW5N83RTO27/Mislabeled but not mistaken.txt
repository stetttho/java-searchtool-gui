 A proper title for this book would have been "The History of Papal Aggrandizement in the Catholic Church."  As such few would have bought it.  The title as given implies a discussion of Wills' reasons for being a Catholic; this is not the subject of the book.  The book is an historical account of how the Roman papacy has usurped power, has built itself into a monarchy, and has violated the spirit and often the letter of the faith.  It could have been called "How to be a Catholic without the Idol in the Vatican."  That might have sold.  In any case, the book is an effective defense of those who from the beginning until the First Vatican Council of 1870 have resisted papal supremacy and arrogance.  It is totally convincing and should be read by Catholics who think that their Church as it has been over the last 130 years is all there is to know.  Wills deserves praise and respect for his defense of true Catholicism -- one which would lead to a union of the Roman and Orthodox churches if taken seriously.  One wishes he had not mislabeled the book.  Those not liking the book will be the ultramontanists -- those who think the pope is closer to God than to man.  Protestants will learn something valuable:  that being an historic, traditional Catholic does not mean worshipping the person or allowing the inordinate power of popes.
