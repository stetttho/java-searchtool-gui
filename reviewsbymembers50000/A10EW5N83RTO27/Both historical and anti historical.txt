 A very tedious read, indeed.  The author has emersed himself in the history of this remote eastern province of the Austrian half of the Austro-Hungarian Empire on the eve of the Great War, but he has got too many historical details wrong.  He deals here only with the Jewish population and the small governmental elite, all of whom speak German, while the majority population of one kind of Slav or another is invisible.  The plotting of a few Jews against the government is quite unlikely -- this is not Russia but Austria -- and the plotting of some aristocrats even less likely, since the German speaking aristocratic elite as well as the Polish-speaking aristocatic elite were loyal to the monarchy.  Some of the inner frustrations of the various characters are indeed interesting but the overall impression is one of confusion and fantasy.  The fact that the chief spy of the Governor, Jakob Tausk, may end up after the war as a Bolshevik Chekist is quite in keeping with his history and character.  The Governor is perhaps the most interesting character -- a symbol of what was wrong with Austria as a feudal, Catholic absurdity surviving into the modern world.
