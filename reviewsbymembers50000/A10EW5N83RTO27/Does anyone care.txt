 Rousseau and Hume were each in his own special way very radical in their influence.  Both undermined the established philosophical, religious and political orthodoxy of the 18th Century.  The fact, the subject of this book, that they could not get along personally is neither unusual nor interesting.  Many of the greatest thinkers and writers fought one another over what may seem to others as trifles.  Voltaire also had trouble getting along with people, not least of whom with Rousseau.  The authors mention too briefly that someone of note who embrassed both Rousseau and Hume was Immanuel Kant.  Very true and very significant, because it was Hume's influence which led Kant to read Rousseau as a source of finding a solution to the problems of reason and sentiment.  Kantian Idealism was the chief and important result.  The authors are learned enough but make some foolish mistakes, such as ascribing to Voltaire a work they call "Maiden."  This is their translation of his scandalous poem La Pucelle about Joan of Arc.  A normal translation would have been "Joan the Maid."  "Maiden" to my knowledge has never been given as the title in English.  Personally I reverence both Hume and Rousseau and don't feel the least imposed upon to know they had a spat.  I knew it in any case.  I don't think this book can really justify itself.
