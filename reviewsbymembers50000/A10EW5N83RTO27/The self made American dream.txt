 Bill Clinton had no rich family, influential friends, or powerful patrons.  Yet as a youth he thought that coming from a lower-class Arkansan milieu was no bar to reaching the White House.  He evidently believed what he was taught in school:  anyone can become President.  And he did, by sheer talent and determination.  He had many skills and many flaws but as we contemplate the current disastrous occupant of the White House we can see that, having left behind the  disdain of the elites and the hatred of the semi-fascist talk show hosts, we can give Clinton pretty high marks for intelligence, competence, good will and genuine Americanism.    John Harris obviously likes Clinton and succeeds in helping all of us not consumed with hatred or disdain to like him as well.  Clinton will be remembered as a rather good President and an inspiration for many Americans who still want to believe that wealth and power are not prerequisites for high office.  The book also reminds us that what may seem important at the time -- like seedy sexual adventures -- are really not so important at all.  Puritanism and ideology are not good guides after all.
