 Its value much exaggerated, this book is a good example of what political scientists do.  What they do is to try to pretend that their work is scientific when it is actually quite speculative and subjective.  I got more from Oswald Spengler and Arnold Toynbee, who had some philosophical training and historical perception, than from this academic spinner.
