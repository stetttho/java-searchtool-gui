 Rightwing Catholics cannot stand any criticism of the machiavellian policy which is correctly identified with the Catholic Church.  Prof. Lewy was one of the first to tell the awful truth.  He is a pioneer.  If I hear one more time that Pius XI or Cardinal Faulhaber defended Jews I will scream!  The Pope attacked racialism to be sure, but not in any way meaningfully to retard the Nazi program or the enrolling of Catholics in the racist scheme.  The Cardinal defended Old Testament Jews, which meant he had nothing to say about the living Jews being beaten or shipped off to death camps in his midst in Cologne.  The Catholic Church destroyed the Zentrum in Germany which before 1933 was the strongest anti-Nazi force.  Thereafter Catholics fearing being regarded as unpatriotic Germans flew into the arms of the Nazis with enthusiasm.  The Church bears considerable responsibility for the weakness of the anti-Nazi resistance.
