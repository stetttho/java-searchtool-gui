 This book is ok for light reading, I suppose.  You learn a little about the world of media ambition, but since human nature is no different in different professions what you learn is hardly surprising.  The sex is pedestrian and the murder plot not very exciting.  I like O'Reilly because he is a right-wing talk-show host who is not a crazy Fascist like Hannity and Limbaugh and Gallagher and the rest, but a reasonable man.  But he should stick to his radio and t.v. programs and give up writing the great American novel, which this is hardly.
