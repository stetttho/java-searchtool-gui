 It's sad to have one of one's heroes shot down.  Apparently Koestler's understanding of why old Bolsheviks caught in the Stalinist terror confessed to crimes they had not committed was based less on facts than on his own psychological dilemmas.  It is also tiresome to have yet another biography of a central European Jew caught between assimilation and anti-semitism and between Communism and anti-Communism.  As for K's alleged sexual proclivities, I could not care less.  Another hero gone.  They have taken George Orwell out by showing his nasty side, and now they have taken out Koestler.
