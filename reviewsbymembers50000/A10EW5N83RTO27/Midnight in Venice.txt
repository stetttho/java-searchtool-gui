 John Berendt has accomplished the impossible:  he has made Venice duller than Savannah!  As a matron in Midnight replied when asked if she traveled much:  we Savanahians don't travel much, we have everything heah!  Berendt has managed to make Savannah, its history, its excentric residents, its mores, much more interesting than the dull citizens of Venice and the American expatriates who populate it in order to save it from floods and historic neglect.  The story of the fire is not as interesting as Jim Williams and his gay life of secret pleasures.  Nor is the gay and erotic poet who is found hanged in Venice as interesting as Danny Hansford.    When I had heard some years ago that Berendt was planning another novel about an old city I expected it to be Mobile or Charleston where he could perhaps have found another Savannah.  He choose instead a European city, like any midwestern tourist with tennis shoes.  This book is a bore and it took me over a month to get up enough energy to read it to the end.  The conclusion:  Berendt's stiking it rich with Savannah was entirely a fluke.  I don't think there will be a third novel.  It would already be discounted over 50%, now that the one on Venice can be bought for 40% less everywhere.
