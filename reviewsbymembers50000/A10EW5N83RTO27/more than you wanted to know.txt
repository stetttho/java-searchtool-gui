 An excellent analysis of what can be known about Hitler's mental and physical health.  Along with books by Rosenbaum and Kershaw it provides  probably all that we will ever know.  The really difficult question is not  why Hitler had such peculiar views and the will to put them into effect,  the real question is why the most developed country in Europe, perhaps in  the world, allowed this pathetic excuse for a human being to gain total  control by more or less democratic means.  Ian Kershaw so far provides the  best insight into what was wrong with the Germans and what in Hitler  appealed to them.  It turns out that the Germans were to be sure odd --  they were "German" -- but not much odder than other peoples.  One  can say one doesn't think one's own people could support a Hitler but one  cannot be sure.  The attraction of evil remains the supreme puzzle.
