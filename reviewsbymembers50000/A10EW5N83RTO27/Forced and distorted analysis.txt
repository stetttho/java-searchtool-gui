 Claiming to have discovered never before seen documents attesting to Pius XII's early anti-semitism, which would explain his less than forthright defense of the Jews pursued by Nazi killers, Cornwell actually finds  nothing about Pius' anti-semitism which is not forced and distorted in his  hands.  He does indeed contribute something important in documenting  Pius'desire to centralize the Catholic church even more than it was.  He  also documents the unfortunate Vatican weakening of the German Center Party  in the last days of the Weimar Republic and the first days of Hitler's  regime.  But this does not compensate for his vitriolic attack on Pius  whose major fault (a real fault in a Pope, perhaps) was being more of a  diplomat than a pastor of souls.
