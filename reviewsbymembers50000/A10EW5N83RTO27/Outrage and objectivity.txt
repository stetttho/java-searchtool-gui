 Leff provides a necessary look at how the most influential newspaper in America dealt with the Nazi regime before and during the Second World War.  It seems to me that given the very important strength of anti-semitism in America during the first half of the 20th Century, the amazing thing is that the American Jews were not persecuted and interned on some pretext, that the US supported the creation of the State of Israel -- and just barely did so despite the opposition of the State Department -- and that American Jews have reached a position unequaled anywhere.  It all might have been different and in the days of Father Coughlin and Charles Lindburgh and Joseph Kennedy it certainly looked like it would be different.  Ms. Leff has meant well and has made a contribution.  Moral outrage in this case is less useful than a calm assessment of the real forces at work in America concerning the Jews and how best to prosecute the war.  The real outrage should be saved for the role of Christianity for fifteen hundred years or more in victimizing the Jews -- to the extent that only a small percentage of Christians could avoid the  ever-present temptation of Jew hatred.
