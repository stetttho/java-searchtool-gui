 Magnificent book.  It has been clear for a long time that the Gospels and the letters of Paul do not give the real Jesus.  I will mention only two things for ignoramuses liked J.T. Hobbes. 1. Paul never met Jesus, so why does his version have any authority? 2. We know that the earliest Christians were led by James of Jerusalem, the brother of Jesus.  The Gospels do not mention him and the Epistles mention him unfavorably.  His group knew the most about the real Jesus and they were considered heretics.  It is clear that what the churches teach is false.  Prof. Robinson has constructed what Jesus was really about from the Q source.  Even Robinson, however, should acknowledge that whatever Jesus intended and hoped for were defeated -- both by his death and lack of resurrection and by the churches which claim him.
