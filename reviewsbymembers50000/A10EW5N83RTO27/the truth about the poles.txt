 To hear them tell the story, the Poles are the Christ of the Nations, the sacrificial lamb among Prussian and Russian wolves.  The truth, however, is a bit different.  The Poles suffered a great deal under Nazi occupation but they will never tell you that what they suffered from most was the Nazi unwillingness to let them help in making Poland Judenfrei.  The Nazis did not think the Poles, whom they regarded as inferior, were good enough to help them kill Jews.  The Germans even preferred the hardly human Ukrainians and Lithuanians.  The Poles actually since the mid-19th Century, and certainly since they got back their independence in 1918-19, wanted to get rid of the Jews but did not have the stomach for it.  "Rent a Nazi" was their ultimate solution.  It worked well.  When the Poles got their chance, as at Jedwabne, they performed admirably.
