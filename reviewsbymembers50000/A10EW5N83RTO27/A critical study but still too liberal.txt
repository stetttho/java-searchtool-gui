 Dallek presents much new material.  We have a Kennedy whose life was beset by serious medical conditions, by an upbringing of no warmth or concern from absent parents, and by a bullying elder brother.  Who can have anything but sympathy for what JFK was nevertheless able to achieve?  He was also stymied in his presidency by excessive warmongering by the Right, which was largely responsible for his entanglement with Cuba and Vietnam.  He handled Khruschev's folly in Cuba very well, all things being equal.  Dallek is an accomplished historian but his prose is too wooden and academic.  The book frequently drags.  Dallek as a liberal is too quick to fault JFK about his tepid record on civil rights.  As someone suspicious of Negro adventurism I applaud Kennedy's unwillingness to give in too much to the black revolution which we call the civil rights movement.  It remains to be seen whether blacks are really better off today than before 1960.  Still all in all, Kennedy as president was hardly of the stature of FDR or Harry Truman.  This book helps to remove some of the myth.   Kennedy is personally more appealing but presidentially somewhat less so than before.
