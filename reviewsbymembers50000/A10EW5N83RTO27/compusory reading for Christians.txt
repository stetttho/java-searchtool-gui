 Since the Renaissance Christians have had to cope with considerable rationalistic and scientific objections to the dogmas and beliefs of orthodox Christianity.  With this excellent detective history book of Prof. James Tabor, an accomplished biblical scholar and archaeologist, Christians will have to consider the very real possibility that what they think about Christianity is totally wrong.  Prof. Tabor suggests and gives ample corroboration to the idea, not new at all, that Paul of Tarsus and his followers essentially invented an imaginary Jesus who was in some sense divine and came to save men from their sins.  We find here, instead, a Jesus who was thoroughly an apocalyptic Jew in the pattern of Albert Schweitzer's pioneer study Quest of the Historical Jesus.  Jesus can be known through the beliefs and practices of his earliest followers who were led by members of his own family, starting with James the Just.  These early Christians believed Jesus to be only a man, an exemplary one to be sure, who hoped to become God's instrument for the restoration of Israel.  While his death had not been expected, his return as God's messenger was at the heart of the early Christian belief.  The Christian Church accepted Gospels about Jesus which marginalized the earliest Christians and Jesus' family, and in later years condemned those who knew Jesus the best as heretics.  Paul, who knew Jesus only from epileptic delusions, became the authority for Christian faith.  Christians ought to be forced to read this book!  It contains more truth than the tendencious New Testament, which is simply Pauline propaganda.
