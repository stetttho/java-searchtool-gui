 Good, sensible comments on the disaster done to California by the influx of Mexican immigrants, legal and illegal.  They are turning California into a province of Mexico, ....  But Hanson, although an academic and presumably accustomed to outlining his theses with some care, gives us a repetitious screed rather than a reasoned analysis.  I suspect he wrote the book too quickly and is in fact writing far too many books in a short time.  In any case, I found all he says true during my almost forty years in California, the change from a sparsely populated paradise to a congested, foul-aired, ecological and demographic disaster.  He might have said more about the role of the Catholic Church in smuggling immigrants across the border, encouraging their failure to assimilate, and in making the Church an instrument of decadence rather than uplift.
