 Bosworth does a good job showing how shallow Mussolini really was.  He believed in nothing and in everything.  He was a disgrace but curiously just what the people of that peninsula called Italy, a "geographic expression" in Metternich's view, deserved.  Mussolini is Godfather Corleone and Tony Soprano! More might have been done to show how Mussolini with all his faults and few virtues was not really a rejection of the Risorgimento but its fulfilment.  The Risogrimento was a fraud and so was Mussolini.  His career was an Italian Soap Opera -- fitting for this very unserious people.
