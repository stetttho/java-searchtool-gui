 This book is a failure if its purpose is to document Stalin's murders.  Solzhenitsyn and Anne Applebaum have done it more than adequately.  Amis has a lot of baggage concerning fellow-travelling family and friends which intrude here and is the real subject of this book.   His personal concerns spoil his discussion of Stalin's crimes and the horrendous apparatus of death which the Bolsheviks created. I cannot see the point of this book at all.  It is a tribute to self-indulgence as perhaps only an Englishman feels free to indulge.
