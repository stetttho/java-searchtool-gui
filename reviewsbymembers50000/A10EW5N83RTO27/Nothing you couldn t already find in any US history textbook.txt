 Gotten up for the 2004 election this book on the 1800 election is a good read but offers nothing new.  It has all been done before.  One might think that you could get some relief from the fact that even in 1800 men as "noble" as Adams, Jefferson, and Hamilton could engage in shenanigans which would make even Dubya Bush blush, in other words that we have not declined as much as we thought.  But we have.  The passions of Adams, Jefferson and Hamilton were much nobler and enlightened than anything Karl Rove & Co. can concoct.  The only value in the book is that you do come away with a feeling of gratitude that the election of 1800 held despite predictions of the end of the Federal Union.  America has survived much, not to mention the evil Civil War which only an evil people and leadership could allow to occur.  Let's hope it can survive what this new electoral cycle may bring:  the re-election of a man who has been called unfit for work even in local animal control or the election of an aloof New Englander about whom you can only admire his wife.
