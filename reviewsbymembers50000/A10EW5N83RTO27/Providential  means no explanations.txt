 A very embarrassing book because it really tells us nothing wewant to know.  What was it like growing up Jewish in wartime Hungary?Just a few inconveniences.  Why did he become a priest?  Not a word about belief in anything?  Why did he leave the Church?  Just seemed the best thing to do?  How did he become a leading scholar of the Dead Sea Scrolls and of Jesus as a "Jew." Quite by accident. There isn't an answer to any real question here.  But there is a lot of self-serving prose and a general attack on two centuries of Christian scholars who have found the capturing of the "historical Jesus" a difficult if not impossible task.  For Vermes, it is pretty easy to get to the historical Jesus; all you have to do is to realize he was a first-century Jew!...
