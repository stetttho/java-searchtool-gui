 Many colleges and universities now have programs or departments in ethnic studies, or specifically in Chicano Studies, Jewish Studies, etc.  And we think that is fine, although some twenty or thirty years ago some academics questioned such fields.  But in  Nazi Germany "Jewish Studies" were big on campus.  They were the place where ambitious and/or anti-semitic academics -- biologists, demographers, sociologists, criminologists, historians -- lent their academic skills and insights to the Nazi program of denegrating Jews as foreign, dangerous, insidious, and noxious to Germans.  No one claims that without seemingly scholarly studies of Jewish communities in Lithuania and Ukraine, or of Jewish marriage patterns in Leipzig or Frankfurt, the Nazi would have in any way been impeded in their plans for the elimination of Jews from Europe.  Nevertheless many academics -- some with splendid credentials -- were willing to use their talents in the service, ultimately, of genocide, whether they saw this clearly or not a few years before.  Nothing here is surprising, since scholars have been showing for decades how much German elites helped and favored the Nazi assault on liberal, democratic, socialist, and Jewish life in Germany and beyond Germany.  But it is good to have the way this occurred shown in some specificity.  Alan  Steinweis has written a most timely and important little book and it deserves to be read and pondered.  Scholars and intellectuals have often betrayed their calling -- in America as well as in Europe -- but rarely has this taken place with such murderous consequences.  The nature of scholarship, objectivity, science, and learning is laid very bare here for all to see.  It needs to be more than a blame-the-Germans game, for it could very well happen here -- indeed, in some ways it has already happened here, with regard to slavery, African-Americans, Jews, and non-northern European immigrants.  It can happen again.
