 Having read an interesting article on Ron Hansen in the Wall Street Journal as a "Catholic writer," I decided to read his work.   "Mariette In Ecstasy" is interesting if you are interested in  nuns, which I am not particularly.  But this Hitler story raises a general  question:  is there any point in historical novels?  I have read a great  deal about Hitler and the enigmas in interpreting him, especially the most  impressive book by Ron Rosenbaum, "Explaining Hitler."  Rosenbaum  reminds one that much of historical writing is really fiction to one degree  or another, and this then raises the question whether fully novelistic  treatment of historical figures and events is warranted.  After reading  this novel I am ready to say that I got everything I needed from  Rosenbaum's treatment and Hansen's novel does not add anything, nothing  interpretative, nothing esthetic, nothing at all.  It keeps one's interest,  or rather the subject of Hitler keeps one's interest, but Hansen really has  nothing much to offer.  I am sorry to say this and I will continue to read  his stuff, but I think he has gotten off the track here.
