 This book is in a long line of books about why France is hard for non-French people to understand.  There have been much better ones, especially the one by Ted Morgan whose real name was Sanche de Gramont.  Adam Gopnik is a clever writer for the New Yorker and that is his problem.  He thinks that since he was in Paris with his wife and young son and also had another child there he might have some especially fetching things to say about the French.  He doesn't.  I spent two years in France with a young child and know that he is pretty banal about it all.  The French are interesting and infuriating.  To do them justice requires a writer more interesting than Gopnik.
