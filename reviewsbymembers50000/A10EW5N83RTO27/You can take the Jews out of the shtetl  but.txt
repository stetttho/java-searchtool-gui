 You may not be able to take the shtetl out of the Jews.  This is a moving and beautifully written book about life in Jerusalem among recent immigrants to Israel from the 1930's through the war of independence.  Even the most nationalistic Zionists -- followers of Vladimir Jabotinsky -- found it difficult to be anything but Europeans.  Perhaps the Jews should have insisted on part of Poland-Lithuania-Ukraine as their homeland; it would have been an easier adjustment than the Levant which they had lost contact with for at least 2000 years. I realise this is what the fanatical president of Iran is currently saying, but it may in the long run have been more true than not.  Amos Oz lived among nationalistic Zionists; his uncle was Joseph Klausner, a distinguished historiand and partisan of the Zionist Revisionists.  Oz, however, in the end reject their integral nationalism, but we don't know what he would put in its place.  Indeed, with the Palestinian Arabs still refusing compromise and a live and let live relationship with the Israelis, the Israelis have probably no choice but to pursue the integral nationalism of resistance and uncompromising rigor.  It's a tragedy.
