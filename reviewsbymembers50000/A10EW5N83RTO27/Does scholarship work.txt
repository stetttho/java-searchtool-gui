 The work of excellent biblical scholars like John P. Meier is fantastically impressive.  But there is a serious question to be pondered.  After four hundred years of biblical scholarship it is more than clear -- it is Loud and Clear -- that Christianity is fiction.  The real Jesus and the Jesus of the Gospels and the Epistles are not the same.  The Gospels are propaganda not history.  But people still believe what the churches and clergy tell them.  That makes the work of scholars from Richard Simon and Benedict Spinoza in the 17th Century to thst of John P. Meier in thke 21st Century WHAT????   Certainly not effective.  What is the point of it all?
