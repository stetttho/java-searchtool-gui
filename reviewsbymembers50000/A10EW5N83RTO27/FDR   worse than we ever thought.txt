 This book is what we Roosevelt haters have longed for for half a century.  No hater of "that man in the White House" and his awful wife could have thought in fantasy half as much as Thomas Fleming demonstrates in fact.  This book should be required reading for all liberals, Democrats, and leftists, and for all Jews I would recommend mandatory reading or a period of mandatory community service if they refused!  Jews in America think FDR saved them from Hitler.  In fact he prolonged Hitler's reign long enough to allow him to finish off the Jews he had not yet begun to kill in massive numbers.  Without FDR, as without Woodrow Wilson, the 20th Century would have been less violent and less disastrous.
