 Pipes' view of Russian history is the classical one which finds everything Russian non-European, barbaric, autocratic, and incorrigible.  There is plenty of evidence supporting this view.  Many Russian thinkers have concurred.  Yet objective observers have to call this view of Russia "Polonophile," that is to say pro-Polish.  This is what the Poles always said about the Russians, often with justification but not always. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was the exact opposite of Russia:  it had powerful nobles and gentry, a Catholic as opposed to a Byzantine Church, political institutions, an openness to the West and its intellectual and religious diversity.  But with all these advantages the Poles could not maintain their world, they treated the peasantry no better than the Russians did theirs, and the Poles never achieved the cultural heights of Russian literature and music.  The Germans who also had all the cultural advantages of the West fell into a despotism even more degenerate and evil than the Russians.  So one has to agree with Pipes that Russia is not good liberal material, but then neither are many other nations with more advantages than the Russian ever had.  In sum, one does learn much about the Russian proclivity towards authoritarianism but the book does not prove that the Russians cannot change.  We may yet be surprised by Russia.  Pipes is also known for his belief that Soviet Communism simply replayed the traditional Russian proclivity for autocracy.  This ignores the real achievements, the positive achievements of the Soviets:  education, science, culture, literacy, modernity.  Tsarist Russia was making progress by 1914 but it is hard to know what it would have achieved without the Bolsheviks.
