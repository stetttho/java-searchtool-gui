 Apologetics, a traditional Christian effort exists because Christianity has a lot to apologize for:  genocide, defamation, tyranny, persecution, and other evils.  Along comes George Weigel, a noted Catholic propagandist, who writes at least one book a year denying the true history of the Catholic church.  He tries to claim that Europe is somehow worse off without its Catholic heritage.  Most Europeans care nothing for their European heritage and they are right.  This heritage, which gave much culturally, artistically, and philosophically, also murdered dissidents and was ultimately responsible for 6 million dead Jews in the last century. Mankind has paid an horrendous price for whatever good Christianity has done.  Weigel as usual needs to be taken with a good deal of salt.
