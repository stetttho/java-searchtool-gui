 Brinkley has demonstrated great ability in his research and writing, in his sympathetic imagination and his judgments.  However the book is almost impossible to read:  too much detail, too many individuals and their stories, too much unavoidable repetition.  There is almost too much information from which to draw any conclusions, except the obvious ones: 1. At all levels government failed, but the higher the authority the more monumental the failure. 2. New Orleans and the Gulf Coast were a disaster just waiting for Katrina, geographically, demographically, socially, and culturally. 3. The rebuilding of the damaged remains should proceed only when and if enough funds are really available for a proper reconstruction which would make another disaster virtually impossible. 4. Even without Katrina, this part of the country was rotten to the core and would have collapsed of its own weight eventually.  Katrina hastened that process.  New Orleans is the monumental underside of America:  a third-world tribal African country hidden by Ptomekin-like facades.  Probably Prof. Brinkley was too concerned with getting a best-seller out.  I don't resent this -- he deserves the acclaim.  But real history cannot yet be written on this topic.  It will, when written, not be about water and sickness, levees and bridges.  It will be about what is wrong with America in the Age of Bush.
