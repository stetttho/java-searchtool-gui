 Maccoby's work is solid and well meaning, but the Christian world and even the ex-Christian world is not ready for the truth, perhaps it never will be ready. The idea of Jesus taught by the Christian churches is so out of tune with what actually might have happened that it is in fact easy to show the Gospels as mere Hellenistic novels and not historical truth at all.  Maccoby does a great job of showing how Paul of Tarsus (if he were from Tarsus) invented Christianity, a religion about Jesus which had nothing to do with Jesus.  But Christians will pay no attention and ex-Christians will not think the issue worth their trouble.  But it will all come out in the wash when dead Christians discover that there is no salvation through Jesus, that there may not even be an afterlife, that there may not even be a God.  By then they will no longer be able to care, but their descendants on earth will still be plagued by bible-thumping redneck illiterates who think the Bible actually has something true to say, which it does not.
