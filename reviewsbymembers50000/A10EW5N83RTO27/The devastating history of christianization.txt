 Although Charles Freeman denies the influence of Gibbon, he essentially is at one with Gibbon -- as any rational person must be.  Christianity is based on untrustworthy recollections of Jesus and unreliable theories about who he was.  The attempt to make all this somehow philosophically consistent and meaningful only resulted in stultification, for all the theories about Jesus' relationship to the Father are essentially nonsense.    The insistence on propagating Christianity could only and did destroy whatever remained of classical reason.  Men like Ambrose and Augustine -- always given a good press, even by non-believers -- emerge as murderers of reason and at time also of men.  Ambrose developed the politicization of religion which continues to this day in the Church of Rome.  Augustine combined all the sexual frustration, intellectual cowardice, and religious bigotry of the growing Christian communities into a magnificently evil legacy, which has been tragedy for the West.  Eastern Christianity has one advantage over the West -- it ignored Augustine.   Freeman is daring to a degree -- showing the greater intellectual honesty of Islam and also the probably more accurate view of Jesus which Islam had -- but he is still too wimpy for me.  I am pesuaded by this book and many others that Christianity is the greatest fraud ever perpetrated on a civilization.  He needed to say this more directly.
