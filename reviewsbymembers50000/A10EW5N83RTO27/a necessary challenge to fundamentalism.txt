 Ehrman is doing for the New Testament what scholars long ago did for the Old Testament:  he shows how the books we have in the bible have been edited and re-edited, arranged and rearranged for a variety of reasons many times in the days before the 'canon' was fixed.  Fundamentalists will not  like this because they regard the Bible and its divine inspiration having  come down, as it were, on a cloud from heaven.  A more sophisticated view  of inspiration believes that men are inspired as well as misled by a  variety of factors, God being only one among many.  I don't know whether  fundamentalists will even take this book seriously.  One could also wish  that Muslims would finally get off their butts and begin to view the Koran  as something similarly re-edited and re-arranged in the early days and not  something that the Angel Gabriel dictated to Mohammed.  Religion has always  gotten a bad name from its most devoted followers.
