 Not since Oswald Spengler and Arnold Toynbee (the British version of Spengler) has anyone taken Iranian religious history and culture so seriously, but so much of what we think of as Jewish and Christian is really antique Iranian and Zoroastrian that this book should be of use and insight for many.  The Christian idea of heaven, the reign of the Messiah, the End of the World, and the Jewish Talmud all have roots in Iranian religion, as mediated by the Jews of the Babylonian Captivity. Unfortunately, this book of good scholarship joined to a travelogue will no more than many another fine piece of scholarship convince fundamentalistic Jews and especially fundamentalistic Christians who resemble Muslims in thinking the Bible came down from Heaven on a cloud, from God himself.  Those wanting to believe that the much edited and variously influenced books of the Holy Bible contain accurate historical evidence of the past and reliable prediction of the future -- a widely held and totally erroneous opinion among American Christians -- will not be convinced that Zoroaster was an important figure in the creation of our religious tradition in the West, although he certainly was. Scholarship never seems to convince the true believer.  I think particularly of two hundred years to three hundred years of scholarship on the Historical Jesus and also of a recent book by two Israeli archeologists, Finkelstein and Silberman, "The Bible Uncovered," which shows that much of the Old Testament's history, including the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, is not history at all but historicized theology.  This book, well worth reading, will only convince those with open minds, not the closed minds of Bible thumpers.
