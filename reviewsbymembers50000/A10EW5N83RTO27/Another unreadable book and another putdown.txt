 It is perhaps hard to be sure this book is a putdown.  For some, finding that Jefferson wasn't always rational and calm may make him more human and therefore more appealing, but for me it is a downer.  He seems to have had a miseable inner life.  Thank God that he was able nonetheless to do a lot of good.  The book helps to explain many of Jefferson's wrongheaded views:  about Hamilton, about the radicals in the French Revolution, etc.   The author is talented but he quotes so extensively from Jefferson's own feelings, which in themselves are so unreadable, that the book necessarily becomes unreadable.    This may indeed be a useful contribution to our knowledge but I could have done without it.
