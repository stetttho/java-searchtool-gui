 Having decided not to take third-year Latin in High School I always wondered if I had missed something.  Cicero was the subject of third-year Latin.  I needn't have worried.  Cicero was, this book reveals, just as boring, self-serving, ridiculous, and irrelevant as I had always thought.  His defense of Republicanism was reactionary and totally out of touch with what military success had made of Rome, an empire based on military rule.  The feckless aristocrats whose cause he championed were among the most benighted and ridiculous pack of thieves in history.  Caesar, whom Cicero opposed, was the only farsighted Roman leader.  His death was a tragedy.  Augustus, his grand nephew and first Roman "emperor" saved a good deal of Republican Rome but in the hands of his inferior successors the Empire became a pure despotism.    Roman politics is enormously complicated in the Republican period and this book tries but fails to make it more understandable.  Better read Suetonius, who had a sense of humor and a pornographic streak.   Cicero remains one of the most overrated authors in history.  Rarely did he have an original thought.  He was a wheeler-dealer and ultimately failed in all his endeavors.
