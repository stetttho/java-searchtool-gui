 The last ten years of Trotaky's life was one of exile and assassination, an account worthy of the death of Jesus and Socrates.  Mme Trotsky even remarked that her husband when mortally wounded look like Jesus taken down from the cross in an El Greco.  It remains to me still incomprehensible that so many Communists and supporters of Communism did not come to Trotsky's defense and aid, allowing that thug Stalin to persecute him, to destroy his followers in morale and in life, and finally to send an assassin to finish him off.  Granted that Trotsky's position against Stalin and in favor of the Soviet Union was perhaps too sophisticated for most Communists to rally to, he was after all still the greatest Communist figure after Lenin and perhaps even including Lenin.   Trotsky would of course have been horrified to learn of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but had he led the Soviet Union after Lenin much might have been different and better for all concerned.  He certainly was more right than Stalin about Hitler, about China, and about the dangers of extremist collectivization and industrialization, even though collectivization of agriculture and rapid industrialization were program he had initially advanced against the hesitations of Stalin.  In the end Bolshevism has in Trotsky its hero and prophet which nothing can really take away.   This reprint series, others have correctly noted, is marked by numerous typos and other errors.
