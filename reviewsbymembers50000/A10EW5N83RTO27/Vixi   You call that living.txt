 Sharing with Pipes the status of a retired professor of History I can attest to the accuracy of his comments about the Academic Life. He has shown with brevity the congenital disabilities of academics, plagued as they are with insecurity and ambition.  He has also shown well the foolishness of leftist historians of Communism and the Soviet Union.  His experience as a Reagan official in the foreign policy field was disillusioning, as one might have expected. But I bring away two additional reactions.  One is that Pipes, for all his erudition and ability, is hardly a mentor, an inspiration for students.  I have myself found few if any great scholars to be particularly inspiring as anything but narrow role models and Pipes certainly is in line with this.  Secondly, Pipes is far too reticent to discuss the Holocaust which almost took his life.  He does reflect on the special pervisity of the Polish people who would rather forget that for half a millenium large numbers of Jews shared their lives, but he is far too reluctant to say much more about this.  He also claims that while the Holocaust made his own father doubt divine providence, his own reaction was in the opposite direction.  Anyone whose faith is strengthened by Auschwitz needs to do some explaining.  Pipes would rather bury himself in Russian history than reveal himself to his audience.  This is his way of self-preservation.    Another uptight academic pretending to be something he cannot be -- a wise man. Pipes has been accused of a "Polish" bias in his view of Russia as essentially Asiatic and barbaric.  With his rather justified contempt for Poland and its unfulfilled promise he does not deserve to be considered pro-Polish.  The Poles like to think they are superior to the Russians, but they are not. Pipes is a Zionist above all.  One hopes he is not as crazy a Zionist as his son, Daniel Pipes, the leading Likudnik fanatic among American academics.
