 Rosenbaum has indeed done for Hitler interpreters what Albert Schweitzer one hundred years ago did for Jesus scholars, he shows that we do not study the past to learn about the past but to learn about ourselves.  But where  Schweitzer remained sceptical of all attempts to get to the real Jesus,  Rosenbaum in his last chapter seems to succumb to one particular  interpretation of Hitler, that of Lucy Dawidowicz; this constitutes a  failure of nerve on his part.  Nevertheless, Rosenbaum has performed  brilliantly and his book should be the starting point, perhaps even the  finishing point, of all study on Hitler.  It occurs to me that the most  important thing in life may well be to understand Jesus and Hitler!  Yes,  that is exactly what I mean.
