 What exactly is reading this book punishment for?  It has to be punishment for those who have decided that the Scriptures of Jews and Christians are essentially literature, not God's revelation.  Harold Bloom treats the Bible as if it were literature and we hear more about Shakespeare and Hamlet and King Lear than about ancient religious figures.  It is not that there is anything wrong with this approach.  Bloom is well read in biblical scholarship and knows many important things which most believers have never learned:  that the historical material about Jesus of Nazareth is virtually non-existent; that attempts to find the historical Jesus are doomed to failure, as Albert Schweitzer demonstrated over one hundred years ago; that Yahweh is a very odd God; and that his chosen people haven't had much joy in him.  But the constant resort to Shakespeare, to whom not all of us are idolotrously committed, and other authors does not really contribute that much.    Bloom dedicates this book to a wonder biblical scholar, Donald Harman Akenson, but seems not to have learned the lesson Akenson teaches, that the Jewish and Christian religions came both out of the mishmash of Second Temple Jewish religion, a highly variegated body of speculation and belief which could and did lead to countless versions of religiosity.  Bloom insists that there is no Judaeo-Christian tradition, which runs entirely counter to what Akenson intended.  Bloom writes ramblingly about almost everything and anything but he fails to draw meaninful conclusions.  That is not entirely his fault but it makes this book more of a punishment than a pleasure.  I cannot honestly say I have learned anything I did not really know about Yahweh and Jesus.  And what he is teaching about the much overrated Shakespeare I could have done without.
