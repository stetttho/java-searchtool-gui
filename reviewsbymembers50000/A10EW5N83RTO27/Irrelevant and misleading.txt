 Goldberg attempts a slight of hand; he attempts to save religion from the contempt and scorn it deserves by trying to save a place for it apart from science.  He urges religious people not to be seduced by wanting to show that their beliefs are scientifically supportable.  But the problem is that religion has a place only as long as science has not come up with an explanation of a particular phenomenon.  It is true that science will never answer all questions, since it only asks questions which have an answer -- at least ultimately and theoretically.  But the questions which have no answer, questions about meaning and purpose, which we all care about will not be answer by science.  BUT, BUT, BUT -- neither will they be answered by the fairy tales from the Bible, the Koran, the Talmud, or the Hindu Scriptures.
