 This book is remarkable in that it avoided taking sides in the great nationalistic battle between Ukrainians, Russians, and Poles.  It presents all the different theories about who the Ukrainians might be, whether they are or are not a typc of Russian, and whether their national aspirations are credible or not.    But, it manages to avoid entirely an important fact:  the western Ukrainians (long under Polish, Hungarian and Austrian rule, but never Russian rule until after WWII) -- those very Ukrainians Americans like to favor as pro-western -- these are the ones who helped with glee to slaughter countless Jews in their midst during WWII and many thousands of Poles in Volhyhnia and eastern Galicia at the close of WWII and shortly thereafter.  One any only conclude that the author and his Ukrainian clients have something very big to hide.  I remember with some bitterness that before a memorial to massacred Jews could be erected in Nassau County, NY, another memorial had to be erected as a show of "equal time" to the Ukrainian victims of Stalinism.  This is hard to take since those very Ukrainians so remembered were among those who slaughtered Jews for the German occupiers.
