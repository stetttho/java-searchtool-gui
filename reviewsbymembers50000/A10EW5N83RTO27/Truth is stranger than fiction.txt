 It's a good read but the discussion generally of what guilt and crime really are, the judicial system, and all that is pretty surface-like.  We can all agree that having DNA now is a good thing and that fewer innocent people will be punished for their apparent but not real crimes.  Some years ago I read about a young woman who killed her lover/husband and got away with it.  You can imagine how I felt when I discovered that she had lived next door to me as a little girl for about six years or so.  I know how Junger feels about his family's involvement with De Salvo.
