 As a recent newcomer to Savannah I read everything I can about the place.  This novel is very entertaining.  It is especially good about the subculture of Savannah Catholics, something which makes Savannah, Charleston, Mobile, and of course New Orleans different from the rest of the South:  the Catholics did not go far inland, fearing being scalped by the Baptist Rednecks!  They stayed in the ports and imported their priests and relatives from Ireland (except for New Orleans, of course).  They are the reason Savannah is fun and Macon and Augusta are not! But the book is not MIDNIGHT.  It is just ok.  It is better than the two novels by Dr. William Harris which are about more ordinary, therefore dull, people. (Except for Francis, the Nazi-IRA spy.) But Savannah has enough characters and excentrics for many books.  This one is worth reading.
