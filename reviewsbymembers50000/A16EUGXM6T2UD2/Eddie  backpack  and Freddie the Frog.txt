 This is a nicely made doll by Fisher Price.  My son loves Eddie, and when I came across this, I just bought it on a whim.  He doesn't carry Eddie everywhere, much to my husband's relief, but he does enjoy this toy.  I think he'd like the smaller version better, but this one is about 10 inches tall, with a backpack that comes off, Freddie the Frog that is the same size as the original Little People, and a plastic comb -- oh and a DVD that is 3 short Little People claymation stories.  Fisher Price does have smaller versions of these dolls, that are roughly 4 inches tall, and I'd like to see Amazon offer those as well.  My son has since figured out that there is a Sonya Lee out there.  We're in trouble!
