 My 4 y/o loved playing his older cousins Leapster, so when I found the older unit at a great price, I got it.  I knew I'd have to have the same Dora game, but could only find this L-MAX version.  The problem starts with a feature of the L-MAX that only allows one of the games called "Animal Adventure" to be played if L-MAX is plugged into the TV.  That means the older, cheaper verion of Dora offers an extra game on the handheld!  I think product development really dropped the ball on this one.  I returned the L-MAX version and found the cheaper plain Leapster version instead.  I'm still offended that Leapfrog would charge more for this version and offer less.  If your kid doesn't need to plug into the tv, pass this one up and shop for the non-L-MAX version of Dora's Wildlife Adventure.
