 This is a nice set of construction vehicles and construction equipment for little boys.  With the exception of the included toy boulders, the pieces (signs, and vehicles) are larger than the FastLane line of toys and much higher quality.  The plastic is heavy/thick, not flimsy and the moving pieces are smooth to operate.  The four construction men that are included fit inside several of the vehicles, some standing, some sitting.  I ordered two of these sets prior to the 2005 holiday season and I'm glad I did.  My two boys (4 and 2 y/o) love them.
