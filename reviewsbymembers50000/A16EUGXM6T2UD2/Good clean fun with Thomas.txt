 Educators may think this product stifles free play and creativity, but if your son or daughter is a Thomas Fan, this packet of Aqua Doodle mats are ideal for paint-time without the usual mess.  There are four mats, each with a different picture.  The nearly blank mats are smaller than a regular 8x11 sheet of paper, and when water is applied with the crayon sized aqua doodle pen or even a regular paint brush then the Thomas picture is revealed.  My oldest prefers to use a paint brush rather than the AquaDoodle pen that is included.  After a few minutes, depending on saturation, the page dries and is ready to be "painted" again.  Clean up is easy requiring only a paper towel to wipe up and water left over.  No mess, no fuss, and my kids love them (ages 3.5 and 15 months!!!!)  I also purchased the Pooh set, but found that those sheets are already partially revealed, more like the paint with water coloring books.  The Thomas set is only shows the Thomas emblem when dry.  Overall, I recommend this product for good clean fun.
