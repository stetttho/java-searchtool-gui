 My children have just entered the world of Spiderman and I stumbled across these toys in my local big box retailer.  After seeing these up close, I would have expected the price point to be closer to $20 - too much for us.  I was pleasantly surprised at the $9.99 price and based on apparent quality and low price point, I immediately was swayed to purchase every character in the line (Nightshade Spidey is a darker shade blue, Reg Spidey is a standard blue, Green Goblin, Venom). These incredible figures are 12" tall and articulated (26+ points depending on character).   The detail on these hefty guys is outstanding. They are not flimsy, can be posed to stand on flat surfaces, and have been well enjoyed by both my 4.5 y/o and my 2+ toddler. They have excellent entertainment value for my kids who love action figures and play sets. Fight scenes are rampant with Spidey beating the bad guys and the world being saved yet again.  All of these figures seem durable (dropped all over the place, flying, falling etc). They are at a great price. They do not come with any accessories, and I don't think any are available. Not a drawback, IMO, as I believe it to encourage imagination.  The Spideys and Venom are less detailed than the Green Goblin. His detail is almost overwhelming. Any Green Goblin fans will not find a better-made product.  Because this is such a glowing review, I will state, I am not affiliated with the mfg etc, just a parent who feels they got a really good deal on this toy.  The only drawbacks I can think of are: 1. My toddler can get frustrated with trying to pose the figures to stand and does need help to do so. 2. Only four figures in the line. I would love this line to include a Firestar and Iceman for my "Spiderman and His Amazing Friends" fans.  Hopefully Amazon with get pictures up soon, these are incredible!
