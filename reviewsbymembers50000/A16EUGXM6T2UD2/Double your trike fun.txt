 This is a helpful attachment.  We have the happy navigator trike with a push bar & seat belt and added this insert to accommodate our two boys, 4 and 2 y/o.    Easily installed in minutes, just screws in place, this is a solid piece of equipment that allows my kids to take a neighborhood walk/ride together.  The front passenger is the pedaler, while the rear passenger is just along for the ride.  Good for the younger kids that may not be able to pedal yet.  With the added pushbar, I have more control over hills, braking, and giving an extra push if the pedaling becomes too tough for my oldest.  I also installed a seat belt on my trike for the benefit of my youngest.  That way he's not trying to pop off while we are all in motion.  Your front passenger should be capable of steering well; because once you've added this tandem seat, trying to steer using the push bar becomes a little difficult.  Typically with a one seater and the push bar, you can pop a wheelie to help steer, but with two seats and a pushbar, popping a wheelie will not work as well.  My pushbar now has a nice bend in it from doing this.   Happily, my 4 y/o is now steering well, and we are enjoying this tandem trike seat immensely.  "Look, Mom!  I'm a good driver!"
