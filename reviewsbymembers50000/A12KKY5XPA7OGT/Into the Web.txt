 After 3 sub-par novels, (Peril, Moon over Manhattan, Taken) Thomas Cook is back to doing what he does best. Very complex mysteries with a romantic angle to them. I have been reading mystery novels for over 40 years and when Thomas Cook brings his "A game" there is no one better. As ususal Mr. Cook ties up all the loose ends and finishes with a surpirse ending.`He never cheats on the ending and he makes the trip to Kingdom County worth the ride.
