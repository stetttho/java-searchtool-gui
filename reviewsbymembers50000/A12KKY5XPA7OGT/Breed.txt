 Ok! This is not Mr. Goingback's best book. But it is still a cut above the average horror novel. This book is a little different in the fact he tries his hand at a little humor in the ghost or  spirit of Tolomato. I know this has all been done before, but it is still a good novel. Mr. Goingback deserves a large following.
