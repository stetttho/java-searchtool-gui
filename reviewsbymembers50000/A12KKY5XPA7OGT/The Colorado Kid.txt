 I guess King knew readers were either going to love this one or hate it. I fall into the love group. This is the Anti-Murder She Wrote type of story where the puzzle does not fit. Ellery Queen would be lost on this murder. This is King thinking way outside the box. Sometimes I have trouble with King getting too wordy. Well this is a fast paced story that moves and has some delightful dialog between the "old" reporters and the "new" girl.
