 Very quirky book. This is my first book that I have read by T.M. Wright. It starts out when Harry Briggs dies and goes to a town called Silver Lake. He will meet some very odd characters along his journey and learn some of the rules of being a ghost. Mr. Wright fails to tie up all the loose ends (almost like there may be a sequel) and leaves the reader hanging.I like the P.I. aspects of the book and the humor. If you like horror and do not like "blood and guts" this may be for you.
