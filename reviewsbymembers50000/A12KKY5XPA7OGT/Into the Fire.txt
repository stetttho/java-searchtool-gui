 I purchased the English edition of this book many months ago. The British title is The Glory Bus. Ok! I like the title The Glory Bus better....Anyway this is a good send off for Richard Laymon, who I have loved some of his books and some of his books....well let's just say I could have lived without them. As the years go by I miss him more and more....Everything I have read about him he seemed like a nice guy, who at times could be the most creative voice in horror. Anyway, back to Into the Fire or The Glory Bus....This is a good Laymon book. Not his best...But good....I would say in the upper 1/3 of his writings...and that's not half bad...
