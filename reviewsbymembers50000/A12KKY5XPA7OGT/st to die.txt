 Not really up to the standard that Patterson set with the Dr. Cross series. It's like he combined women detective novels  with women M.E. novels and then added a "pinch" of women crime writer novels and "stired" in a little women lawyer (DA) novels for good measure. The finish has lots of twist and turns but we expect that from Patterson.
