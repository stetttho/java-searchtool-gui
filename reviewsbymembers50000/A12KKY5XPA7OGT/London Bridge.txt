 This London Bridge is not only falling down, it should have never been built (or written). There is still some of the old James Patterson magic, but this comes across as almost a parody of Patterson's work. Wolf and Weasel come across as more like  villains from a James Bond book. (unlimited money, unlimited manpower and unlimited bombs) The pace is fast and furious as with all Patterson books but that is where it ends.
