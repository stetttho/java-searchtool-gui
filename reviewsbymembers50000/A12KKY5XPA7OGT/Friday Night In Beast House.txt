 It is still hard to believe that Laymon is not with us anymore. But this is a good finish to the Beast House Chronicles. All the Laymon elements are here. Make no mistake about it.   This is a very short novel with very little character development. But there is Beast House, there are the typical Laymon horny teenagers and there is a "Beast".            This book does not really cover the events of The Midnight Tour but Laymon pulls off this fast paced thriller and puts an end to the legacy of Beast House.
