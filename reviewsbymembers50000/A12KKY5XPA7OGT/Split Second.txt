 Just when you think Ms. Kava is going to leave us hanging with a whole bunch of loose ends she wraps up most of the loose ends and finished this novel very strong. This novel was not as exciting as her first novel but Ms. Kava showed more polish. The plot has been done many times in the past (i.e. Thomas Harris, James Patterson etc......) but Ms. Kava adds her only small touches. Good second novel!
