 This book starts real slow. The back cover of the paperback states that a stranger "pounds" on the door of the Young's  house. This happens around page 100 of the paperback. Just when I started to put this book down and go on to something else...BAM!  It really gets going. Then it slows down again....BAM! Here we go again. You'll love Rosemary Snow. You'll want to strangle Joey for his stupidity. Certainly a mixed bag.
