 Ed mcBain will be missed. I started reading the 87th Precinct novels in the early 1970's. I have read all the 87th Precinct books including the short stories. No one did it better than Ed McBain. As far as Fiddlers is concerned it is about right in the middle. It is not his best and it is not his worst. It is the best one of his most recent novels. I guess we will get some re-prints etc.....But from what I've read over the Internet there will be no more new books. That is sad.
