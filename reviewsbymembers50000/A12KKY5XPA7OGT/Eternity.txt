 What a wacky group of characters! This is the first book that I have read by Tamara Thorne but it will not be the last. Eternity is a mixture of suspense, horror and a touch of science fiction/ fantasy. Although the writer did not "tie up" all the loose ends, it is still a great story. Also there is a slight problem with the number of businesses in a this small town. With less than 500 population Eternity had several restaurants/night clubs, resorts, stores, an asylum etc.....My wife's aunt lives in a town of 500 population and all they have is a BP station.
