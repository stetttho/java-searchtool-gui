 How many times have you read a book and thought: "This book could have been a lot better if it were shorter and the writer had picked up the pace". Well, Blue November Storms is a very quick read (97 pages) and the pace is excellent. This book could have been a lot longer. The writer gives us a quick glance at these characters and then leaves us asking for more... Anyway this is a great plot and a great little story.
