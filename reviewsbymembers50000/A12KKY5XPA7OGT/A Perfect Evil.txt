 A nice debut novel. But, there are some problems. Like the fact that I read a 400 page novel and I have more loose ends than I know what to do with. Example, I do not know if Howard and Eddie were involved in the murders or not. Nick Morrelli is either the most realistic small town sheriff in fiction or he is the dumbest. For an ex-football player he sure got beat up a lot. No one was arrested for assaulting an officer. Alex Kava shows some talent but she must step out of James Patterson's shadow.
