 Dolly Parton really got back to the roots of country music with this CD. This is her best CD in years. You may laugh at the idea of Dolly Parton doing a Led Zepplin song (Stairway to Heaven), but give it a try. You will be glad you did. I heard Dolly talking about this song on a syndicated radio show and she stated that Jimmy Page and Robert Plant loved her version of their song.  I can see why.
