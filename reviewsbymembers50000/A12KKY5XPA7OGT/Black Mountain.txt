 It just does not make sense that the "bad guys" plan went so wrong and out of control. They had actually captured there benefactor and were about to "do him in". Where's the motive? Ok! At times the writing is good and the locale presents a strong back drop to the story. But overall, the hero is just standard "variety" and his "girl Friday" proves to be resourceful but very typical. Standard mystery except for locale.
