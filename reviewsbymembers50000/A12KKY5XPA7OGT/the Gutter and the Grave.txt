 Ed McBain will be missed. This one takes the reader away from the 87th and we travel back to the late 1950's. This is a PI story with the punch and power of the great pulps. Not Chandler or Hammett but still very good. The Hard Case Crime is a great series and it is great to see books like this one reprinted.
