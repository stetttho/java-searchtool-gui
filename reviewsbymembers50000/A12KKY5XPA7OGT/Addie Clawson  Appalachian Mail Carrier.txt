 This is a wonderful book. It is the story of Addie Clawson, who became the first female mail carrier in this rural area. It tells of the struggles with the rugged winters and the doubts of many of the people who thought that a women just could not handle this type of a job. After having gone to school at Appalachian State University and traveled this area on my job I can attest to the rugged conditions.  The book is written for children (grades 4-5) but adults will enjoy this book too.
