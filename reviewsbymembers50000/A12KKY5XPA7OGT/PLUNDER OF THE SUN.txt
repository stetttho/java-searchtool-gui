 First, let me say that the Hard Case Crime series is excellent. It certainly opens up the opportunity to obtain great hard boiled detective fiction from the past and the present. This book is not really a detective story, it is more of an adventure story with a hero that could have been a hard boiled detective. The formula is simple: a fortune in buried treasure and a bunch of characters that no one should trust. The author seems to want us to learn the Spanish language while we read this book. There are a lot times that he tells what something is and then gives us the Spanish word to go along with it. Good story. Good pace.
