 An open letter to Mr. Dan Simmons. Dear Mr. Simmons: Please stick to horror novels and leave the PI stories to writers who understand the genre. Your novel Summer of Night is one of my favorites. But Hardcase has more holes than a 20 year old bucket. Why would anybody give an ex-con like Kurtz the time of day, much less quit their old job, give him a millon dollars etc.... And do not forget that in the first of the book Kurtz was looking for a missing accountant. After the accountant's wife is killed you never hear about him anymore.
