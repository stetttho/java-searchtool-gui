 In the past Bentley Little has written about some pretty scary stuff (i.e. vampires, zombie like creatures, crazy towns, haunted houses etc....). Now he writes a book about something really scary.......A Homeowner's Association. Ok! Barry and "Mo" should have moved out after about 50 pages and they (Barry, Mo and friends) never really take the Assocation as serious as they should have. But otherwise this is a good horror novel.
