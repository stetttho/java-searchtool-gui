 Not one of his better books. It is slow in parts and lacks the quick prose of his "Nameless" books. But the major problem is: when did this book take place?  Paperback edition shows a 1994 copyright. But the book refers to President Carter and a "McGovern button". Dix does not seem to have *69 or a cellular telephone. Ending is very unusual and a little sad.
