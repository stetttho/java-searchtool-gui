 Phillip Margolin is one of my favorite writers. This novels keeps his winning streak alive. Katie Ross and Amanda Jaffe are great characters. Ok! Daniel Ames could not have made more mistakes if he had tried. But the novel is filled with interesting characters such as: Flynn, Dr. Fairweather, Billie, Susan, Briggs etc......This guy is good!
