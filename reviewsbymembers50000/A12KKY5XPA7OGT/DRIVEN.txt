 JUST WHEN I START THINKING THAT THERE ARE NO ORIGINAL IDEAS FOR SERIAL KILLERS OUT THERE AND THAT MOST WRITERS OF SUSPENSE ARE JUST THOMAS HARRIS OR JAMES PATTERSON CLONES. BAM!!!!! ALONG COMES W G GRIFFITHS WITH ONE OF THE MOST ORIGINAL THRILLERS I HAVE READ IN YEARS. OK, THERE WERE A COUPLE TIMES THAT I WANTED TO HIT THE HERO (GAVIN) OVER THE HEAD WITH A HAMMER FOR BEING SO STUPID. BUT THE NOVEL IS THRILLING AND THE ENDING IS VERY CLEVER. THERE ARE PLENTY OF INTERESTING CHARACTERS (AMY, BUCK ETC....)  AND THE STORY MOVES AT A FAST SMOOTH PACE. AFTER YOU HAVE READ THIS NOVEL YOU WILL NEVER LOOK AT A TURTLE THE SAME WAY AGAIN.
