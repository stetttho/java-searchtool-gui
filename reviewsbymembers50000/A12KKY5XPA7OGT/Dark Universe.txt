 This book is like finding buried treasure. Where has this guy been all my life? All the stories are good to very good. There may not be that "one excellent story", but this is one of the most solid short story collections you will find. The subjects are as diverse as a "dark universe". There is a ghost story, a serial killer story, a contract killer story, some sci-fi  etc....Great work!
