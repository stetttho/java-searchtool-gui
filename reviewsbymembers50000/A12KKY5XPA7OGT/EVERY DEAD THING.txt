 BOOK INVOLVES 2 PLOTS. 1 PLOT IS ABOUT THE MOB AND THE OTHER PLOT INVOLVES A SERIAL KILLER. THESE STORY LINES WILL MERGE AS THE BOOK GOES ALONG. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS BOOK IS THE FACT THAT THE ALCOHOLIC COP, THE ALCOHOLIC EX-COP  OR THE EX-ALCOHOLIC EX-COP ETC....HAVE BEEN DONE SO MANY TIMES BEFORE. AND MANY TIMES IT HAS BEEN DONE BETTER THAN THIS NOVEL.
