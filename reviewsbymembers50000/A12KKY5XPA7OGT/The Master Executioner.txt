 This is my first western that I have read by Loren Estleman. I have read some of his detective fiction prior to reading this novel. I think he has a better handle on the western field than he does the mystery or PI field. Oscar Stone is one of the most interesting and misunderstood characters that you will meet between the pages of a novel. He is a master of his trade, no matter which trade that might be. He will chose a trade that will cost him his marriage and leave him a lonely & confused person. The book drags a little toward the end, but otherwise this is a really interesting novel. The final meeting between Oscar and Gretchen is both revealing and sad.
