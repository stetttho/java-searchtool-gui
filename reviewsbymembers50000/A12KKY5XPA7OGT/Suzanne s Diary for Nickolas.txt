 James Patterson writing a romance book! Are you kidding me. Ok! I have not read a romance book since The Bridges of Madison County. But when I heard that James Patterson wrote a romance book I could not believe it. I mean that's like Stephen King writing a western or Tom Clancy writing a comedy. Despite that this book is very touching and it is written with Mr. Patterson's  fast paced style.
