 Have you noticed that a lot of horror writers stay away from stories about Halloween. Not Richard Laymon. He plays homage to it to way horror fans want it. This novel works on two levels: (1) a fast paced Halloween story and (2) a B- Horror movie where the "actors" always do dumb things. There are plenty of horror movie cliche in this book too! (i.e. "stay right there!..I'll be right back") October is a great month to read this book.
