 ok, so it is not one of his better ones. this is the story of bodie, pen and mel and they do all the stupid things that people do in B rated horror flims. (don't call the police, don't get medical attention when there injured, don't hit redial on there telephone etc....) still the story is pure laymon and the ending is worth the ride.
