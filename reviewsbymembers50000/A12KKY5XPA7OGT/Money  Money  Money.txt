 Ed McBain (aka Evan Hunter) has always given us great thrillers with his 87th Precinct novels. This one is no exception. He does get away from the long explanations regarding who everybody is. With all the characters presented he gives us this can be a little boring. Especially for us who have followed the 87th for a long time. There are some great scenes between Steve and his family. There is also some humor as Ollie Weeks tries to get his book published. His fans will not be disappointed.
