 Better than some of his "new" stuff, but not up to the standard of his better novels. The GOOD NEWS is that the plot is interesting and reminds us of the time when Dean Koontz really wrote good horror/ suspense novels. The BAD NEWS is the lack of character development and the lack of scope for the entire novel. It is in a lot of ways an expanded short story. And who designed the cover? (hardback) It has nothing to do with the book.
