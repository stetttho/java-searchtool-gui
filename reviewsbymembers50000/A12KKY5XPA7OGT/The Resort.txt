 This is Bentley Little's best book since The Association. I was concerned that maybe Mr. Little may be "losing it" after The Return and The Policy. But in The Resort, he has come back with another great book. Mr. Little has the ability to take everyday situations and establishments and turn them into nightmares and the title say it all about this book. The Resort is an out of the way vacation spot that goes from ultra plush to ultra terror. The Resort is not one of his best books (i.e. The Ignored, Summoning etc.....), but it marks the sign of a great comeback from his "slump". Keep it up.
