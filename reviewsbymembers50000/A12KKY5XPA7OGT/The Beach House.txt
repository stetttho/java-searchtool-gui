 Very good suspense novel. It is not really a mystery since there is only one suspect. But the book moves at a fast pace and will keep the reader guessing as to the final outcome. Ok, in real life the ending would never be like it is in this book. Still this book makes for a fun summer reading experience. Now the big question I have is how much of this book was actually written by James Patterson. You have got the James Patterson trade mark "choppy chapters" but other than that the style just is not Patterson.
