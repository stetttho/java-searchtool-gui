 What a thrill ride this was! Jack Ketchum takes the reader on a roller coaster ride and you do not want to get off. ketchum, who is more noted for some real brutal horror fiction (i.e. Offspring, The Lost and Off Season etc...) uses more implied horror in this one. (we never find out why the maid or Mrs. McCormack fear Mr. McCormack so much, but we get the impression he can be a monster) Then, after you have read RED, take a deep breath and go on and read the novella The Passenger. This 93 page thriller is worth the price of the book by itself.
