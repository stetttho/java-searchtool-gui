 Great plot. Average writing. The escape is made too simple. There are some interesting scenes with the townspeople and the people at the Inn. But otherwise the book has average written all over it.  I was surprised when one of the other reviewers stated  that this book was actually written by Chuck Hogan. When I read this book I thought it was actually written by a woman. Check out page 54 (paperback) "Rebecca noted that the sage-green floral wallpaper matched the fabric of the seat cushions, and the lien". Or page 57 "sitting in a quilt-backed rocking chair with a china cup of blackberry tea...." Does that sound like a male writer or does it sound like one of those cozy British mysteries.
