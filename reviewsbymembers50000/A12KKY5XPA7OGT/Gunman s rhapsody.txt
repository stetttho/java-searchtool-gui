 I thought when I heard that Robert Parker was writing a western I was thinking maybe he would show a similarity to the PI and the cowboy of the old west. WRONG! This is another Wyatt Earp, Johnnie Ringo, Bat Masterson etc......book. There is a simiarity between the conversations of Wyatt & Josie  and Spenser & Susan but I was thinking that just Parker's style. Let's get back to Spenser.
