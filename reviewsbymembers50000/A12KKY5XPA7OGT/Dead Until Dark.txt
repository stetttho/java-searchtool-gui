 Very nice quirky little book. Part mystery, part horror and some very funny humor. (i.e. page 1 "Every since vampires came out of the coffin"  page 177 "All the vehicles were high-priced. You won't find a vampire in a Ford Fiesta") And who ever thought they would read a vampire book with one of the vampires named Bubba.
