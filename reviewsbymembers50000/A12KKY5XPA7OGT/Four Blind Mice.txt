 The King of the short chapters has done it again. He just keeps reinventing the mass murderer. This time instead of a serial killer, Dr. Cross has some ex-Vietdam vets that are on the loose. This story gives a lot of insight into the characters of Nana and  John Samson. I wish we could have learned more about the "3 Blind Mice" and their "normal" lives away from each other. But that just not James Patterson's style.
