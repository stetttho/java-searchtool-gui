 Excellent premise for a book with 3 novellas. Richard Laymon and Jack Ketchum write terrific stories and both should be highly rated. Edward Lee's story is the weakest of the group. As usual Richard Laymon goes for the straight forward punch, while Jack Ketchum gives us something a little different. This book is worth the money and it deserves a larger following.
