 Laymon proves that he is really MOT (Master of Terror) in this one. Acting like no librarian you will ever meet, Jane does all the wrong things and digs her own grave deeper and deeper.  The way he ends every chapter with a "cliff hanger" is very good. Book may be a little too long, but otherwise it is great.
