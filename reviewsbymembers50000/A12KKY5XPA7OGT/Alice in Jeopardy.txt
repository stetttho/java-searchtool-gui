 A bold departure for a true professional. I have been reading Ed McBain since 1972 and this one caught me off guard. The characters are poorly done. You never get to know the children or much about them. Then McBain makes a 180 degree turn from the 87th to the police and FBI in this story, who are more like "The Keystone Cops". It's a different kind of novel, but the bottom line is that it works in the end.
