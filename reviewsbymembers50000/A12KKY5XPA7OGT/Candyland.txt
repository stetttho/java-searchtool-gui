 Not up to McBain/Hunter standard. I have read almost all of the Ed McBain books and I have only read a few of the Evan Hunter books. Part 1 is more about obsession than anything else. I can not believe that Ben/Michael after he got beat up and lost all his money he was still interested in obtaining the services of a hooker. Part 2 Emma and Johnny lack chemistry and would never make it at the old 87th.
