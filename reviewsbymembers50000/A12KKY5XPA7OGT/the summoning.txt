 Very good vampire novel. I enjoy horror novels but it seems like everybody has to write a vampire story. (Some try to make a career out of writing vampire novels) This is different enough to make the reader want to say "ok just one more vampire novel". This novel touches on the fact that vampire lore is different in different countires. Not every vampire can be destroyed by a wooden stake, garlic, cross or holy water.
