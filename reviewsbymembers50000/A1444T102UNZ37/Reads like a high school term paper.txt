 Ian Grey is an angry man, and being angry has traditionally provided fodder for many fine writings. Grey is a disatrous exception. His writing style is that of a detached yet mock-interested outsider displying equal  touches of naivet and arrogance. Naivet and arrogance works remarkably  well in the wirtings of, say, Carl Hiassen, but Grey's ramblings read more  like that of a pretentious high-school student. The similarities with  high school do not end there. Like most high schhol term papers, Grey  strives for too much and ends up with too little. The chapters show little,  if any, cohesion and one must wonder who had bribed the proof-readers prior  to their assignment on this book. When Grey does explore some interesting  themes he is either a)uninformed (i.e. too lazy to do the research needed),  b)too anxious to get on with the next boundary-breaking "insight"  or c)both, as is most often the case. The real horror-story (or comic  relief depending on your frame of mind) of Grey's work is his  "field-work", i.e. 7 hastily conducted interviews with  less-interesting people where one in every four questions concern the  "fascinating" breast-implant phenomenon of Hollywood. In between  these 7 interviews, presented for some daft reason in original transcript  form as if to say 'Look, I Really did do these interviews', Grey tacks on  various stories of encounters with friends of stars or has-beens in and  around Hollywood that one does best in avoiding.  Like a high-school  student, Grey will mature in time, get a better perspective of things,  develop his writing skills, find more interesting stories to write about  and get some psychotherapy for all that 'anger'. Unless, of course, having  this rubbish published gives him a big ego, in which case we'll have to  brace ourselves for more incoherent ramblings from this 16-year old stuck  in a grown man's body.
