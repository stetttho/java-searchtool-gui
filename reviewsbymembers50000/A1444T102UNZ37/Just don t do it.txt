 Imagine a Cornell History Professor tiring of all his earlier works on origins of conflicts and contributing factors in peace settlements that are currently gathering dust in the university library. To get some inspiration for something that might really sell he scans the net for some inspiration. It turns out that two really hot items seem to be Michael Jordan and the discussion about globalization (pornography is too hot an issue for a respected Ivy League professor to write about). Voil, the probable origins of this attempt to cash out on two terms of hype so shameless it makes Disney marketing scams look like charity collections for the Red Cross.  This �short book on large subjects� begins promisingly enough by discussing the subjects of media and corporate control that has exploded in the latter half of the 1900�s. Walter LaFeber declares his intention to use Michael Jordan as a symol for this �new breed� of global capitalism. With the supposed analytical wit of a history professor, this premise seems interesting enough for a critical yet subjective analysis of this phenomenon. You would be fooled into thinking that this book really is about Michael Jordan AND Global Capitalism. Behold, before you lies 120+ pages of unabashed praise of Michael Jordan with no trace of the analysis or juxtaposition promised in the preface. The low point is on page 77 when LaFeber quotes Ebony magazine (...) in an interview with Juanita Jordan about the strife and pressures of being marries to Michael Jordan (what�s next, a historical analysis of the American presidency using such trustworthy sources as National Enquirer?). So tied up and enthralled by the subject is LaFeber, one cannot seize to ponder if LaFeber always approaches his subjects with the same liberation of judgment, let alone critical thinking. If the answer�s yes, we can only pray that LaFeber�s next attempt to reach the bestseller lists won�t be a study of Josef Stalin or some other hideous dictator. In the acknowledgments, LaFeber reveals that this book is a service to a friend who asked for a contribution to a series of biographies to be used in classrooms. This raises some alarming questions; why use a poorly informed history professor to cover the career of a sports personality that any schoolyard kid in the western hemisphere already knows about (short summary of LaFebers �biography�: Jordan hails from the Carolina�s, played basketball like a God and had some minor gambling problems)? Why even include the topic of Global Capitalism when the only purpose it serves is as a backdrop to Jordan�s career?  The last chapter of the book is entitled �the greatest endorser of the twentieth century� and you would be forgiven as a reader in your confusion about whether this refers to Jordan and his commercial tie-in�s or whether it refers to Walter LaFeber and his blatant attempt to sell Michael Jordan and Global Capitalism as if they were God-given gifts for us mortals to worship. If I were the dean of Cornell University, I would seriously review my list of staff and make sure that other faculty members were barred from using Cornell�s name for fanzine-like projects. Utterly dreadful�
