 Michael J Wolf is a consultant, and it's in consultants's nature to get everyhting 5 years after everybody else, write it down in a simplistic manner, put a glitzy cover on it and give it a profound name, preferably  with the prefix "In Search of..." or "How.... changed the  world".  Michael J Wolf is no exception. The book is littered with  clean-cut examples, like being in "awe of a Disney cruise ship"  or " realizing that the groovy sounds of Sheryl Crow could be used to  launch a new GM product". It reminds me a lot of the writings of  Michael Eisner in the Disney annual reports - clean cut, diluted, soulless  and with a tone of voice that reminds us of when 40/ 50-somethings tries to  utter the words 'cool' or 'hip'. Wolf isn't for real, he is an overpaid  Harvard-grad who entered the biz at boardroom-level spewing out  trivialities top-management about "downsizing, value-adding,  entertainment- factors, yadda, yadda, yadda". This book is strictly  for the Tom Peters clientele, the middle management types who once a year  "take a walk on the wild side" with a "groovy" (and  expensive) workshop and the compulsory buffet...in short, the wanna-be  visionaries.  See Michael J. Fox in Teen Wolf, instead, it's a more  entertaining combination of the author's name.
