 Similar to HIT MEN, in that it explores the darker side of the music industry, ROCKONOMICS describes the huge record budgets that predicted the current wave of signing deals that put Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Janet  Jackson on the cover of major magazines and newspapers in the early  nineties. Marc Eliott makes a very classy presentation, and, like HIT MEN,  ROCKONOMICS is a heady read, because both the artists and the deal makers  are familiar current names. This book seems to be driven by the author's  anger over the commerciali- zation of rock, and Eliott's zeal seems to  qualify his book for membership into a quintet of fascinating books:  ROCKONOMICS, HIT MEN, STIFFED, THE AGENCY, and Jory Farr's 1994 title,  MOGULS AND MADMEN: THE PURSUIT OF POWER IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.  Unlike most  music industry titles, ROCKONOMICS, after surfacing in the early nineties,   has gained sales momentum and stayed in print throughout the decade. The  credibility of its premise seems to grow with each passing year. Ron  Simpson, School of Music, Brigham Young University.  Author of MASTERING  THE MUSIC BUSINESS.
