 If you've watched the two-decade evolution in pop music industry expos books-going from general veiled accusations and using pseudonyms, to the hard- hitting journalistic romps that are being written today, naming  names, dates, companies, and places-then you'll appreciate the HIT MEN of  the classical world, Norman Lebrecht's WHO KILLED CLASSICAL MUSIC, which,  while it may not name vulnerable artist names in all the damning anecdotal  situations in which Lebrecht places them, does explore the life and  business of classical music in an alert, candid, and yet affectionate way,  naming companies, managers, artists, salaries, and even top-echelon concert  fees.  Readers who may follow classical record-business entrepreneurship  will be glad to find that the great independent- label success stories of  our era, such as Naxos and Hyperion, are very much a part of Lebrecht's  consciousness and research. There are no clear-cut classes of heroes and  villains here, just a general sense of regret and fatigue about the current  state of business in the classical world.
