 It's an event when Jimmy Webb, the songwriter who epitomized both the romance                     and the innovation that characterized the songcrafting of the sixties and seventies           ("By the Time I  Get to Phoenix," "Wichita Lineman," "MacArthur  Park," "Up,           Up, and Away," etc.) turns his  attention to writing a book about the songmaking           process. Not  only a great songwriter, Webb in his heyday was also admired as the            possessor of a bright youthful intellect and a zany, happy sense of  humor. The           bulk of his hit-laden song catalog was completed by  age twenty-five or so, at           which time Webb mostly disappeared.   For those insiders and fans who have been           paying close attention,  Webb has added to that catalog in more recent years,           contributing  such underpublicized gems as "If These Walls Could Speak" (Amy            Grant, et al, early eighties) and "California Coast"  (Linda Ronstadt, about 1990), a           song that also helped celebrate  the comeback of Brian Wilson, who created           delicious and plaintive  Beach-Boys-style background vocals for the cut. In           TUNESMITH,  we're allowed to be there as Jimmy Webb explains which writers            and which songs he has admired, and we watch in fascination as Webb  dissects a           few of these personal favorites to lay bare the  structure and the art within. Jimmy           Webb is said to have spent  four full years creating TUNESMITH, and his love for           the craft is  obvious as you turn the pages and absorb the insights being shared. A            tip for researchers: Paul Zollo did an excellent retrospective  interview with Webb           after the songwriter had been silent for at  least a decade. The original interview           can be found in the annals  of SongTalk, the journal of the National Academy of           Songwriters,  or much more easily in Zollo's excellent book of reprints, SONG-                       WRITERS ON SONGWRITING. And finally, a trivia question for Webb  fans: on           which pop album can a version of Jimmy Webb's very first  song, "There's           Someone Else," written as a teenager in  Oklahoma, be found? Answer: Art           Garfunkel's  "Watermark."
