 Dannen hit such a home run with this thoroughly researched book that he was honored from within the music industry (Ralph J. Gleason award) and without (national bestseller list). The topic here is unwholesome practices  within the music industry, but the most passionate subtopic of Dannen's  research is the system of independent promotion through which singles are  "added" to radio station playlists and then moved through the  charts. I almost think HIT MEN should be considered a must read for anyone  in the music industry: artist, manager, songwriter or publisher. Since  Dannen reports his quotes exactly as they come down, you will not find the  dialog exactly suitable for Sunday School. The second edition covers events  up to and including 1991 and contains a follow-up chapter not in the  original 1990 hardback edition.  Now, some years after its original  introduction, HIT MEN is still gripping and relevant. Aspects of the  described litigation still tend to resurface from time to time, and many of  the key  players identified and profiled by Dannen are still suited up and  swinging on the music-business diamond.
