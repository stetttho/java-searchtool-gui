 With a new introduction, and an interesting disclaimer about the legal advice contained in the text, songwriter Henry Boye has recycled his earlier SELLING THE SONGS YOU WRITE for the contemporary market. It's  essentially the same text, with identical chapter headings, motivational at  first, then more technical as the book progresses. I thought SELLING THE  SONGS YOU WRITE was a great little project in 1975, and it still works  today. But as a music business book for today's songwriters, it is eclipsed  by contemporary authors such as John Braheny (THE CRAFT AND BUSINESS OF  SONGWRITING) or Jason Blume (6 STEPS TO SONGWRITING SUCCESS), who are  new-generation practitioners  teaching with more detail.
