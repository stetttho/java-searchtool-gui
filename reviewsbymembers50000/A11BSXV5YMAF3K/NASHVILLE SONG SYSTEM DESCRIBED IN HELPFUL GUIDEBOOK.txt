 Koller is a working Nashville songwriter who also sits on the board of the Nashville Songwriter's Association International (NSAI), which does a terrific job of mentoring capable young songwriters and giving them an  entry point into the Nashville writers' community. The title pretty well  describes the book, and Koller is an author equal to his task. On another  point, as Writer's Digest pulls back from its ten years of leadership in  the field of music business books (mid-80's to mid- 90's), I'm glad to see  former Writer's Digest authors such as Koller and Paul Zollo finding good  second homes. In the case of Fred Koller, our thanks go to Allworth Press  in New York, a division of Billboard Books. Ron Simpson, School of Music,  Brigham Young University.  Author of MASTERING THE MUSIC BUSINESS.
