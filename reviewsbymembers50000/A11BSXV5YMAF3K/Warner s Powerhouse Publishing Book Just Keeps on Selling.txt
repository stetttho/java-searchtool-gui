 In a handsome edition signifying new publisher Hal Leonard, this fine little book has literally snowballed through the music publishing community, gathering speed and legitimacy over two decades.  Author Jay  Warner has been an enduring and successful presence in the music community.   I remember being introduced to the first edition of his book in the  seventies, and subsequently (mid-eighties) spoke with him on the phone.  Though conditions and trends in music publishing have changed since first  publication of this book, it remains an excellent resource and features  both a detailed anatomical description of a big publishing company and an  extremely useful checklist of procedures which are used by bigger  publishers but are easily put into practice by anyone who is serious about  making a business out of showing songs around.  Jay Warner's writing style  is fast and fun, and his distribution deal for this book with the gigantic  Hal Leonard organization has given Warner the broad exposure and up-to-date  book design he has long deserved.  In my first review of the 1978 edition  of this book in 1984, I expressed the hope that the book could be updated  and have a long shelf life.  All these years later the book has received  those periodic updates, is still on bookstore shelves, and keeps selling  better than ever. Ron Simpson, School of Music, Brigham Young University.
