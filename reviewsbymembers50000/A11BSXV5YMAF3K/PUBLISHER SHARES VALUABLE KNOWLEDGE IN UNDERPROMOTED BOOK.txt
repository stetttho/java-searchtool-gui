 At first glance this is a rather pricey manual for starting a publishing company, but MUSIC PUBLISHING  covers the process from top to bottom, beginning with the obvious first step of setting up the business and  continuing clear down to the more sophisticated problem of administering  others' catalogs. Each music business author has a unique approach, and  Whitsett proves to be unusually well qualified to advise publishers, thanks  to his wealth of domestic and foreign experience working with major  publishers. The mouth-watering chapter in Whitsett's book, which echoes  most young songwriters' first question, is "How Much Can I Really Earn  from a Hit Song?" For anyone contemplating a venture into publishing,  I strongly recommend Tim Whitsett's guidebook. Ron Simpson
