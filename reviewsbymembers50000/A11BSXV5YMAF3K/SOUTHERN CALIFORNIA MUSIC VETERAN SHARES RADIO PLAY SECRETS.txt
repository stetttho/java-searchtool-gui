 GETTING RADIO AIRPLAY codifies the procedures that many who record independently, such as singer/songwriters, bands, and their support people, quickly learn by experience: you send out review copies, then you follow up  in a professional, organized manner, and then-sometimes-you get airplay.  Hustwit, who has run an independent record label based in Southern  California, unselfishly shares what he knows, including some good inside  tips on promotion and publicity, and lists of key people and organizations  who can help.  Also valuable are interviews with folks who have experience  and knowledge in the indie/college scene (independent labels and college  radio stations). As daunting as the whole self-publicizing thing can seem,  bands and artists can develop a plan and succeed, and Gary Hustwit's  suggestions form a good platform from which to start. To his credit, he has  continued to update this work. Be sure you are buying the 3rd edition, with  a 1998 date of copyright. And remember this, too: significant income can be  derived from turning one's music into a self-propelled record company, even  if the world calls you "unsigned."  Hustwit's related title,  RELEASING AN INDEPENDENT RECORD, is his biggest seller. Ron Simpson, School  of Music, Brigham Young University. Author of MASTERING THE MUSIC BUSINESS.
