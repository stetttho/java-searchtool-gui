 The follow-up to her popular Billboard book, THE REAL DEAL: HOW TO GET SIGNED TO A RECORD LABEL FROM A TO Z, seminar entrepreneur Daylle Deanna Schwartz turns another popular seminar topic into a Billboard Books title:  START AND RUN YOUR OWN RECORD LABEL. While most new artists dream of  signing with a major label, others, such as fellow New Yorker Ani di Franco  (Righteous Babe Records), opt to take the entrepreneurial path. Author  Schwartz speaks on this subject with experience, reporting with devilish  enthusiasm how she-as an artist-found no majors interested in signing a  white woman artist who boasted rapping as her stock in trade. Revenge, she  says, was sweet, and Revenge was also the logical name for Schwartz'  start-up record label, which enjoyed success during the five years she kept  it going. The book-like the seminar-covers the obvious but necessary  topics: setting up a business, working with  contracts, signing your  artists, marketing and promoting your products, touring your artists,  doing business in the international arena, and aspects of Internet  marketing.
