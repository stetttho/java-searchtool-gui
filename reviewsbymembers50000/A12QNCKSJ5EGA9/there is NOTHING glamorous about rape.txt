 This is the only Catherine Coulter book I have read.  I have some serious issues with this book.  First, real heros do not rape.  Second, women do not fall in love with their rapists.  Third, women do not climax while  being raped.  Fourth, the hero, who raped the heroine, was actually  outraged when the heroine was gang raped by four brutes.  Like he's the  only one allowed to be a rapist!  Fifth, calling it being  "ravished" as opposed to being "raped" does not render  it any less of a violation. I understand that this is fiction, but it is  EXTREMELY IRRESPONSIBLE to glamorize rape in such a way.  I have no  intention of finding out if all of Catherine Coulter's books are as  irresponsible.   These books are supposed to make you root for the main  characters.  How can you cheer on a rapist?  It is a shame that there are  people who just look the other way when reading these horrific scenes.   Some people actually gave this book 5 stars!  Scary! A very disappointing  book from an author who came highly recommended.
