 No one can honestly claim that Sandra Hill has not done her Viking  research.  I have read several of her books and found each one to be  well-researched in the Viking culture. There is a lot of humor throughout  this book (I'll never look at a bottle of Breck shampoo the same way  again), and Rolf & Merry-Death belong together! I enjoyed the little  twist on time travel here.  Instead of the heroine traveling back through  time and learning to live without electricity and indoor plumbing, the hero  comes to the future!  His struggles to acclimate himself in the here and  now are fun to read about. This book touches your heart.  This was the  best Viking book I have read by Sandra Hill.  Keep them coming!
