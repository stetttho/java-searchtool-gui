 It started out well enough.  Zena, the orphaned heroine, has totake her baby brother and leave her Aunt, who was going to marry heroff to a lecherous old man.  Zena showed strength by leaving all that was familiar to her with nothing but the clothes on her back, and embarking on a journey to her grandfather's place, which she thought was her only hope of survival. Enter the hero, Alex.  He thinks she's nothing but a common hooker, and thinks she'll be good for a few romps in the hay.  He even manages to fall for her.  Not bad, considering that in this book, women are just men's chattel, to be bought, sold, and traded.  They argue, so she continues on to her grandfather.   Along the way, she is attacked, and Alex, feeling guilty about arguing with her, goes after her.  He finds her drugged and ready to be sold at auction...  How romantic.  He "buys" her (after all, women are just commodities to the aristocratic playboys) for some rubies and horses.  Then he takes her home and uses her some more (because that's all women are good for in this book). After another argument, she runs away again, to bear Alex's child alone.  She gets raped by one of the men who bid on her at the auction (but lost)...  What garbage! This book was just one outrage after another.  Save your time and money!
