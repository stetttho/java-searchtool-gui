 WHAT WAS CONNIE MASON THINKING?? Normally, I enjoy Connie Mason's books (and I have read most of them).  I don't really understand how she could have gone so far astray here.... There is a whole laundry list of things that are wrong with this book.  Since I'm working with limited space...I'll try to be brief. ...The abuse that our "heroine" suffers at the hands of our "hero" and other secondary male characters is quite disturbing. 5.  There are racist overtones throughout the book... There are actually many more things wrong with the book but unfortunately, I can't specify them in this review.  This is actually my second try at writing a review on this book.  The first review I wrote was denied...because...I "revealed too much of the plot"...I assure you that there was nothing TENDER about the FURY I experienced from reading this book. Since I can't be any more specific with why I hate this book, I ask that you trust me on this when I request that you not waste your time.  Read this book only if you're in the mood for some outrage.
