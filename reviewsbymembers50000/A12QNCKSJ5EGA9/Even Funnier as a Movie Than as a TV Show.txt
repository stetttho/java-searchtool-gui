 I knew when I went to go see this in the theater that it would be funny,  but I was unprepared for just HOW funny! There are obvious laughs, and  subtle inside jokes that keep you in stitches!  I liked this movie so much,  I bought the video and lent it to everyone I could think of.  No one  thought it was stupid. I especially enjoyed the spoof of Les Mis.  The  songs were great (who knew they could write songs and sing them reasonably  on-key?) and the soundtrack is good too (but not as good as the  movie!) This movie is for anyone who wants to laugh for a few hours, but  is not easily offended.
