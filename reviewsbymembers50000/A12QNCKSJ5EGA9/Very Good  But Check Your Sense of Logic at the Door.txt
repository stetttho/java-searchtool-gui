 This was the first Karen Marie Moning book I have read. I was touched and intrigued and quite entertained by this book.  I also enjoyed some of the supernatural twists the author threw in.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the whole premise of the book is a contradiction.   Lisa works as a cleaning lady in a museum when her curiosity gets the best of her.  She touches a flask, not knowing that it is cursed.  The curse brings her back in time to face Circenn, the flask's immortal guardian.  Here is where the problem lies.   In this book, Lisa gets thrown back to the year 1314, but Circenn is IMMORTAL.  So if he didn't die in the 1300's, he should still be alive in the 21st century (when Lisa was working as a cleaning lady in a museum).  So now is there a 14th century Circenn and a 21st century Circenn?  Do they bump in to each other when they jump through time?  What would happen if they did? And if Circenn and Adam can go back through time to change the future for Lisa's parents, could they not do the same for Circenn's mom, who is not immortal?  Or at least go back in time to when she was still alive and visit her? Being immortal AND a fairy with magical powers should have its advantages, no?  Unfortunately, the author failed to explore or even explain these possibilities.  Otherwise, this book would have gotten 5 stars from me. Be that as it may, I did enjoy the book.  I appreciated the mental bond that Lisa and Circenn developed.  The author portrayed the characters' emotions with a lot of depth and sensitivity.  And who knew there was another use for tampons? I would recommend this book to others, but only if they don't mind checking their sense of logic at the door.
