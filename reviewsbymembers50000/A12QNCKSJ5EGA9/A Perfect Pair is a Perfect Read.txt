 Josey St. John and Nate Bennington are neighbors in an apartment building.  Nate hears screams coming from Josey's apartment and rushes to her aid - only to find that Josey was just getting a bit overzealous while rooting for her football team.  Josey is genuinely flattered that her neighbor, a complete stranger, would come to her aid and they become close friends. Their platonic relationship becomes a bit complicated when Josey enlists Nate to help her screen her dates in an effort to find a husband and have children.  While Josey is out finding dates for Nate to screen, Nate has his own obstacles to overcome.  Nate hasn't fully come to grips with his abusive childhood and when Nate's abusive father uses Josey to track Nate down, all hell breaks loose. The chemistry between Josey and Nate is electric.  The dialogue flows easily and the author manages a delicate balance between the humor of Josey's situation and the serious nature of Nate's abusive past.   It's not surprising to find another terrific contemporary read from Jen Safrey.  This author is definitely going places.
