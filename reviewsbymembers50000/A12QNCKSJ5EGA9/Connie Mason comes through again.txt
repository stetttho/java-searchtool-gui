 Another thoroughly entertaining Connie Mason book.  Her romancenovels are almost always top notch.  Lion and Ariana are strong andproud, and Connie Mason makes you really want to root for them to work out their problems and live happily ever after.   There are certain traits that are consistent with all Connie Mason books.  She always writes great sex scenes (and plenty of them!), and raise your hand if you've ever read the phrase "steel encased in velvet" when describing the hero's ( ). You won't be disappointed with this book - it's a keeper!  END
