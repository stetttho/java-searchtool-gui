 This book was recommended to be by Amazon.com's "Recommendations".  I am very glad I checked out that link! I enjoy time-travel books, and I find the Camelot legend quite interesting  and entertaining.  This book wasn't quite perfect, but it was pretty close.    Tessa St. James is smart and brave, with a decent sense of humor.  Her  "Big Guy", Galahad, couldn't succeed in the Quest without her.   Bravo to authors of romance novels who write strong female  characters! Galahad is strong and chivalrous, as one would expect a  Knight of the Round Table to be.  Together, they make quite a team. This  book could have done without Merlin's girlfriend, Viviane.  She was whiny  and spoiled, and frankly, Merlin (being the Wizard that he is) could have  done much better. All in all, this was a good book, and thanks again,  Amazon, for recommending it to me!
