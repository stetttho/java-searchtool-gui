 One of the most amazing books I have read.  Tita is the youngest daugher in her family, and as such, according to her family's tradition, she is doomed never to marry and to care for her tyrannical mother for the rest of  her mother's life.  When she finds Pedro, the love of her life, she can't  have him.  He marries Tita's sister, just to be near Tita.  The only way  for Tita to express her love to Pedro is through her cooking.  Tita has a  magical way with food.  Whatever emotions Tita is feeling while cooking  will be transferred to all those who eat the food.  The obstacles that Tita  and Pedro must overcome are daunting, and yet they still persevere. This  book inspired me to see the movie, which was also excellent (though I  recommend reading the book first.  It makes it easier to understand some of  the symbolism). This book will make you believe in true love!  I guess  it's true what they say: the way to a man's heart IS through his stomach!
