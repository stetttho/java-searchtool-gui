 This was the first Connie Mason book I ever read, and I always find myself coming back to it.  This book throroughly entertains the reader from start to finish.  The sex scenes are hot, and the plot keeps right on moving.    I even lent this book to a doubtful male friend of mine, who scoffed at  me for reading romance novels.  I challenged him to read this book.  If he  thought it was stupid, he could feel free to mock me for the rest of my  life, BUT if he liked it, he could never tease me again for reading  "fluff".  He confessed that even HE got aroused reading the sex  scenes, and he enjoyed the book so much, he asked me for another.  Any  author who can entice a man to read these romance novels (which are usually  written by women, for women) is extremely talented!  It's hard to go wrong  with Connie Mason.
