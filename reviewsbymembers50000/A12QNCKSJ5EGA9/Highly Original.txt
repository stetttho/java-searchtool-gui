 I enjoy time-travel romances, but after a while, the plots start to become alike.  Not this one! Tracy Hill dies while on a date at a bowling alley, and demands from "The Three Stooges" that she be given another  chance....her way!  Little does she know that while granting her  conditions, they send her back to the 1800's.  She becomes the new Nora,  far more bold and outspoken that anyone can imagine.  (Perhaps a trifle too  bold?) This book has a lot of western adventure and even a smidge of  mystery.  It is interesting that all the players in Nora's new life were  also players in her previous lives.  Before I had read this book, the only  one who had successfully pulled off the reincarnation story line was Jude  Deveraux. A good read for anyone who enjoys humor and originality!
