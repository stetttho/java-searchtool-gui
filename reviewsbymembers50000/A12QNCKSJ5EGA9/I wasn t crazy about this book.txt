 I bought this book off the sale rack.  Well, now I know how it got onto the sale rack.  It was obvious to me that this was a sequel book (I had not read the first one, but noticed it got 5 stars on Amazon's review page), and I'm sure there was a  lot I missed by not reading the first one.   This book wasn't awful.  I  enjoy futuristic romances (I love Dara Joy's futuristic novels), and I have  even read some enjoyable books dealing with ESP and the paranormal.  I  thought this would be one of them.  The hero, Drew, is not badly written.   He's strong, and he can also keep up his end of an intelligent  conversation.  Chrysanna, however, is a pampered, spoiled brat.  Her  intentions are good, and her heart is in the right place, and it's very  noble of her to be willing to sacrifice herself for her people, but  ultimately, this book was one that was easily put down.  In reading this  book, you know right from the beginning who the villain is, and the end is  very predictable.  There is nothing "gripping" enough in this  book to keep the reader's attention. This so-so book is going into the  "To Be Donated" pile.
