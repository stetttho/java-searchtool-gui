 An extremely well-written book.  This book combines mystery and romance with the excitement of a day at the racetrack.  Cam, our hero, is the kind of guy every woman wants to find.  Most romance novels portray the heroines  as weak and feeble damsels in distress.  Liz, our heroine, is strong,  smart, brave and independent - and a non-virgin to boot!  A refreshing  change!  This book also teaches you everything about horseracing behind the  scenes.  It was clearly well-researched.  Romance readers and mystery  readers alike will enjoy this book. I highly recommend it.
