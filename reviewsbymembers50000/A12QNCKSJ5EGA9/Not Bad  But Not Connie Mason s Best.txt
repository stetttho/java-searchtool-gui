 Another pirate romance novel from Connie Mason.  I enjoyed this book at first, but the middle started to get a little silly.  The heroine takes a 3 month crash course and decides to become a pirate herself?   Come on.  And  she doesn't know the pirate's true identity?  Seems she fell off the same  turnip truck as Lois Lane.  At the end, I was surprised that the hero had  to "force" the heroine to have sex with him.  Rape is never cool,  and it shouldn't be used as a tool of courtship. This book was OK, but  for a better pirate romance, try Connie Mason's Tempt the Devil.
