 This is a truly brilliant, touching, heart-wrenching film.  You don't really mind the subtitles after a while, and Benigni is a comic genius.   I have heard people say that this film makes light of the holocaust, but  it really is just a father going to great lengths to try to protect the  innocence of his son. It is deserving of all the awards it has  earned. A must see for all!
