 This book is horrible. Any HooDoo worker worth their salt would laugh at this silly thing. I read all the reviews before going out to the book store myself, and though many were unfavorable I thought I might as well give it a chance. All I had to do was spend about a half hour looking through it at the store, all the while in dismay that this was published. I have to say that I would side with those who said they felt this book was only published to fulfill a contract. I have lived in new orleans for many many years and noone I have ever met, worked with, or had any contact with at all practices HooDoo as related in this complete tragedy of a book.
