 This is a wonderful treasure of African spirituality. This book is written in a warm and beautiful way where the author speaks about her childhood and personal experiences. Teish, a priestess of Oshun is an author who should not be passed up. I am also from New Orleans like her and can relate to many of the things she describes. If you want to discover the african spirits for yourself then buy this book, you will not be dissapointed.
