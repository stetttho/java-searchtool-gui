 I bought this book at a time when I was looking for source materials on native american culture and living for the non native american person. The book came reccomended to me by a friend who owned it with a word of caution that it was just alright. I went out and bought it, read through it and found it ok in some places and questionable in others. The author does advertise her other "for sale" services quite a bit which gets a little daunting, however there are some chapters which are well written and full of imagery. The two I liked best were her chapter on crystals where she describes a gift giving ceremony between her and friends, something which I have enjoyed doing myself. I also liked the part onbuilding your own personal altar, unlike other new age authors who proclaim altar set ups and endless tools, the author of this book tells readers to have an empty altar, perhaps covered in a sacred cloth which can be a simple focal point rather than a holder of all sorts of tools. All in all If you want this book then buy it used, use those parts of it that speak to you and discard the rest. Incidently, there is a picture of the author in the back of the book and looking at her I couldnt help but feel a bit uneasy, she dosent present a very spiritual image.
