 This is not a wiccan book at all. If you believe in wicca then stay away. This book is about true witchcraft as a practice, not religion. If you are interested in working with the spirits and practicing witchcraft then you have discovered your book. There is no mention of Karma here and there shouldnt be, karma is a hindu concept not a witch's.
