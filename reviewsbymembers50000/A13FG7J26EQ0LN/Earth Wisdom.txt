 This is an amazing deck that speaks to your very soul. The images are both simplisitc and deep. Though this deck is called the medicine woman tarot, it can be used by males as well. If you follow the wise woman tradition of Susun Weed and Shekhinah Mountainwater then you will find that this deck is for you. I hope you'll give it a chance and experience this treasure for yourself. I would also like to add that there is another version of this deck out there which is left uncolored so the reader can fill in their own colors to the images, though ive only ever seen it for sale once at a local psychic fair. All in all this is an amazing deck.
