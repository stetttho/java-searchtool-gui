 I have to say that this book is the same as Malbroughs HooDoo mysteries. It has almost nothig to do with real HooDoo. I live in New Orleans and like I said on my review for Malbroughs book, Noone I know practices HooDoo like this. If you want root work then check out Cat Yarowande's work, it is atleast acurate.
