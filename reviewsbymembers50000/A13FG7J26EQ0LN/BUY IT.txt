 This is a wonderful book filled with much crystal wisdom. I live in new orleans and have met a woman whos both a HooDoo root worker and a follower of Melody's. The diagrams in this book are wonderful and the techniques are amazing. Many people are thrown by the patterns saying that there are just to many crystals needed but the author clearly states that you can use any number which works for you. Please buy this book and support a wonderfull author and learn about stones at the same time.
