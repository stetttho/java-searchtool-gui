 This is authentic new orleans style conjure. I adore this volume and have it in my library. I live in New Orleans and have practiced HooDoo for some time and much of what is written in these pages is authentic, clear and concise. If you are interested in HooDoo and are not in an area where HooDoo is widley practiced then buy this book, you will not be sorry.
