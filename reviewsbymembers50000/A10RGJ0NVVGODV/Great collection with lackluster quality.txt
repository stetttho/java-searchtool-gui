 Getting to see Edgar Kennedy's seldom-seen RKO short subjects of the 1930's and 40's is a treat. They are down-to-earth, middle America humor. Kennedy's starring series was nicknamed "Mr. Everyman" and the name fits. Also, his trademark slow burn and bursts of temper are sights to behold.  It's too bad that VCI spent so little time with this collection. The content is great, but most of the prints are at best good and for the most part fair to poor, especially "I'll Build It Myself" which looks like it came from a 10th generation bootleg videotape.  The sound on most of the shorts is either muffled or hidden in a sea of hiss and static. But if you can weather the low quality, the films themselves are, for the most part, gems of a bygone era. Florence Lake plays Kennedy's wife in most of the shorts and she was a real doll. I hope that some company will one day give Edgar Kennedy and the other stars of short subjects the respect they deserve and present their films with clear, remastered pictures and cleaned-up sound. As VCI has presented this collection, the viewer only gets a hint at some wonderful comedy from Hollywood's golden age.
