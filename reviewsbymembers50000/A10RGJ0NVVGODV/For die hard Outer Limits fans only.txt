 Okay, so the second season of "The Outer Limits" was not up to par with the first season which is why it died in mid-season, but there are still some gems there. Yes, this collection is bare bones, no extras, no nothing, just 17 episodes. And some of those episodes are really painful to watch, especially considering how great season one was of this classic TV series. Production is down along with the budget. Most episodes look extremely cheap. Season one made up for low budgets by making good use of unusual camera angles, close-ups, and film noir techniques. Most episodes in season two just have a flat look with sleepwalking direction and acting. But, if you are a die-hard like me, you'll bite the bullet and buy this over-priced set. At least it completes the collection. I still like the sand shark episode with Adam "Batman" West and "Cold Hands, Warm Heart" with William Shatner's unique over-the-top acting style. As for the rest of the episodes, be prepared to snooze through them.
