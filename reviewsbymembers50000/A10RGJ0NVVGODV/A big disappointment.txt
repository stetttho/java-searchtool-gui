 I own the "Are You Being Served" DVD mega box set which is great from beginning to end. So I bought the movie thinking it would meet the same high standards. Boy, was I wrong. It's nothing more than a rehash of old skits from the TV series, and badly done at that. The sets look very cheap, the acting is tired, the director offers no direction. In other words, it was very boring with hardly a laugh anywhere. If I were the creators of this classic Britcom, I would have been ashamed to have pawned this "take the money and run" movie off on the public. But don't let this movie tarnish your view of "Are You Being Served," the series. It's still the best of the best. Buy the TV episodes and you won't be disappointed.
