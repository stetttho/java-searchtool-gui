 Can't some company, somewhere give "One Step Beyond" the respect it deserves? I have long admired this fantastic, bizarre anthology series. I remember watching it as a kid first run on television and being scared to death. "Your tour guide into the unknown" John Newland is enough to scare the pants off of anybody, especially the way he wanders through a lot of the episodes. He's usually not content to just show up at the beginning like Rod Serling. While Serling presented himself as the sardonic writer/host of "The Twilight Zone," Newland as director/host of "One Step Beyond" is presented with all the charm of a funeral director who has just heard about a 25 car pile-up on the interstate. He's just plain creepy. The episodes presented here are, for the most part, great. It's the prints for most of the episodes that are lousy. Most are too dark and are full of scratches and specks of dirt. But the worst sin of all is that many are so choppy from splices that it ruins a lot of the dialogue, and dialogue is an important element in the enjoyment (and sometimes understanding) of "One Step Beyond." These prints look like worn-out 16mm films found in the backroom of some television station. Why can't some company out there give the same treatment to "One Step Beyond" that was done a few years ago with "The Twilight Zone"? In other words, clean up the picture and the sound, digitally remaster each episode, or, better yet, find the original negatives and work from those. Let's see this "journey into the unknown" the way it was meant to be. Geez, it that asking too much?
