 I think this is the set I recently bought. It contains 12 episodes with good picture quality and sound. And it also contains vintage commercials that are worth the price of admission. See rare Desoto commercials with Groucho and even some commercials with Harpo and Chico. This is a great way to get 12 episodes of You Bet Your Life at a low price.
