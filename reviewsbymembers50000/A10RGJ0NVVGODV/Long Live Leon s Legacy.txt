 How can one short, paunchy, bald, old guy get mixed up in so many marital misunderstandings and mishaps? It's easy if the guy happens to be Leon Errol. I bought this set not really knowing much about Errol except what I had read about him. I was totally surprised at how great these short subjects were! I was expecting fair and I got great. And what's so amazing is that other stars of long-running short subject series usually experienced a decline in the quality of their series as the years went by (for example, the Three Stooges' Columbia series). However, Errol's series, which ran from the 1930's until his death in 1951, just got better as he aged. The writing and acting in these episodes were always outstanding. Errol was 70 when he died and this collection includes his last short subject, "Lord Epping Returns" from 1951, which has Errol playing duel roles. It's really a very funny short subject. Also, Errol's series didn't rely on tired situations like traveling to different part of the world so that gimmicks and costumes could be utilized. All ten of the entries presented in this collection center around Leon's home or his office. And the plot lines are some of the most complex I've ever seen in any short subject series. Many of them center around Leon's wife thinking he's chasing other women, and often Leon drops hints that he's done just that. While Leon Errol may not be everyone's cup of tea, I feel that he is in a class by himself.  It's sad that today he is almost totally forgotten, but hopefully this set will focus the attention on him that he deserves. I hope VCI will come out with a second collection of Leon Errol short subjects!
