 This is one amazing little gem of a movie. It came and went without much fanfare, but a lot of movies worth seeing do that. They can't all be blockbusters. Harvey Keitel as "Elvis" only goes to show the genius of Keitel the actor and the man. The exterior of Keitel's character believes he's Elvis up to a point, the interior knows there is something spiritual inhabiting his very being. That spirit could very well be the real spirit of Elvis who has come back to earth to right a few wrongs and continue to change lives. Keitel was never meant to look, talk, act, or sing like Elvis. That's the beauty of it all. Where Keitel becomes Elvis is how he interacts with the people he meets and leaves them uplifted. Bridget Fonda plays a sweet young woman who impersonates Marilyn Monroe for a living, mostly in Vegas, but sometimes traveling around the casino circuit. At Robinsonville, Mississippi's Hollywood Casino (yes, these places are real), she meets Keitel and the emotionally shattered Johnathon Schaech, still mourning the death of his young wife from a year ago. Eventually, all make it to Memphis only a few miles from the Hollywood Casino where the spirit of Elvis also lives in his home and grounds known as Graceland. This is a film authorized by the Presley Estate, so the viewer will get to see the real interior of Graceland from angles that tourists don't get to see. This movie will make most viewers laugh and cry. There's a little something here for everyone. In fact you don't even have to be an Elvis fan to enjoy this film. I recommend it highly.
