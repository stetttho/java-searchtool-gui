 This is one strange set. The artwork and music CD are nice, but the rest is a mess. First, the music is on disc one and not disc two as stated on the package. The DVD is awful. The Jack Benny Show is so washed out, it's almost impossible to watch, which is a shame since it's a great show. It appears to have been taken from a tenth generation video bootleg. The movie Beat the Devil is better quality, but still not that great.  The only thing that got this set a one rating is the music CD. It's fun with Bogey sound bites between each slice of interesting jazz, although not much of the music really fits into any of Bogart's films. It's still worth a listen. I wouldn't remommend paying the full Amazon price for this set, but if you buy it discounted from Amazon Marketplace, you might not be too disappointed. In other  words, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.
