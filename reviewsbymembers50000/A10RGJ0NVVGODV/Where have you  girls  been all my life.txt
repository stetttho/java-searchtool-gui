 I bought this CD in the bargain bin at a mall music store and didn't expect much. It blew me away! I have played it over and over. I can't get enough of the smooth, sweet voices of Audrey Morris and Paula Castle.  For the greatest jazz vocals this side of heaven, buy this CD. You won't be disappointed. There are two uncut albums on this CD, both recorded in 1956 and 57. Paula only recorded eight songs in her career and they are all here. Both of these ladies have voices any jazz singer of today would kill for.  So order this CD, relax in your most comfortable chair, close your eyes, and pretend that you are in a smoky jazz bar of the Fifties. This is the real deal.
