 "I Love Lucy" is probably THE greatest of the 1950's TV sitcoms, but "My Little Margie" runs a very close second. Gale Storm as Margie Albright and her father Vern played by Charles Farrell and Mr. Honeywell played by the Clarence Kolb are all superb. These are seasoned actors who take their roles seriously. In other words, they are there to make you laugh and they do an excellent job of doing it. This collection of 12 episodes is well worth the price. The print and sound quality is wonderful for the most part. I just hope this company comes out with future collections. I've seen these over and over again, and I want more of "My Little Margie!"
