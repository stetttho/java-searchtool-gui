 "Crime Classics" marks a high point in radio drama.  The series  centers around true crime from many time periods and countries.  Lou  Merrill is the host of this series from radio's "golden age."   Each episode features some of radio's finest actors and sound effects, and  each contain period music arranged and composed by the legendary Bernard  Herrmann.  These shows are hard-hitting, fast-paced, and are written with a  biting sense of humor.  I highly recommend one of radio's best shows,  "Crime Classics," and invite you to take a dark journey into the  "theater of the mind."
