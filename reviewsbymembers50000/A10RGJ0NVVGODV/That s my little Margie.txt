 Bless Gale Storm and Charles Ferrell for being in the right place at the right time. By doing so they made television history with "My Little Margie." The viewer can see a real love between "father" and "daughter" in this show. There's none of that "give me my fat paycheck so I can get out of here" attitude that is so easily seen in today's sitcoms. Vern Albright's "Boston" accent is a real treasure and Gale Storm is an angel. When I was a kid watching this show first-run, I had a big crush on Gale Storm. I thought she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I'm sure at 81 that Ms. Storm is still beautiful and still getting into mischief. Unfortunately, Vern Albright, Mr. Honeywell, Mrs. O'Detts, and Freddy Wilson have all gone on to TV heaven, but we can still enjoy them over and over again in this wonderful 12 episode set. For the most part the sound and picture quality are GREAT! If you love classic TV sitcoms from the Fifties, you will love this set.
