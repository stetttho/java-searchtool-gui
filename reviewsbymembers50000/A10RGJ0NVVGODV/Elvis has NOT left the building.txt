 You'll have Elvis in your building every time you play this great restored version of the 1970 classic "Elvis: That's the Way It Is." First of all, I want to say that film archivist and restorer Rick Schmidin (who restored Orson Welles' "Touch of Evil") did a FANTASTIC job of reworking this film and adding footage from hours of film shot during Elvis' Vegas concerts and not used in the original release. Most of the fan comments were taken out and more Elvis was put back in. The picture and sound are outstanding. The viewer gets to see Elvis in his prime: a lean, mean, rock and roll machine. They don't call the country boy from Tupelo, Mississippi the King of Rock and Roll for nothing.  My only complaint is that Warner Brothers did not do a double-sided disc with the restored version on one side and the original movie on the other. After recently touring Graceland, I noticed in the "Forever Elvis" museum that they were showing the original version of this movie on the monitors. There I saw many fans expressing their love for the King. Actually, it was quite touching to listen to the comments from young and old and people of all races. So it's really somewhat sad that the original version of this film was not deemed worthy by Warner Brothers to be included on the DVD. Hopefully, when this film is released again, it will contain the original and the restored version.  Aside from that, the restored verion is great and well worth buying. In fact, put a round table with a red tablecloth in front of your TV, add a few drinks, and pretend you are in Vegas in the summer of 1970 enjoying one heck of an Elvis show.
