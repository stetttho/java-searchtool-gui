 If I could give this movie ten stars, that's what it would get! No cult movie collection, B-movie collection, or just movie collection in general is complete without this "lost" film.  If you like the bizarre with a comic twist, this is your film. No real blood and gore here, just a neat little movie with a black and white, Sixties TV show kind of look. This movie was way ahead of its time, with an Addams Family feel to it. In fact, from watching the Addams Family on TV and enjoying the Charles Addams cartoons, I always had the feeling that this creepy stuff was really what they were doing just off camera or in their cartoon basement. The camera work, direction, and most of the acting are excellent. Also, the added features, the 30th cast reunion and newly-discovered eight minutes (an interesting curio that really doesn't add to or take away from anything in the theatrical cut) adds to the overall package. My only complaint is the sound level seems to drop in a few places in the movie, but considering how rare this film is, that is a very minor observation. I don't mind hitting the volume control a couple of times to get to enjoy this gem over and over. Jack Hill and his Spider Baby cast rock big time!
