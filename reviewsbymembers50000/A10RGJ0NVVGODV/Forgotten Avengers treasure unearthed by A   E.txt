 I bought this box set because I love the Avengers and because I want everything that's out there pertaining to the Avengers on DVD. And I bought the first season of "The New Avengers" thinking that I would suffer through all 13 episodes. WRONG!!!  These are simply wonderful! In fact, I watched all 13 episodes almost non-stop. The New Avengers, as far as I'm concerned, is a proud addition to the Avengers canon. Now, A & E, when are you going to release the final season of the New Avengers, and the first half of Honor Blackman's first season? And be sure to throw in as an "extra" the one or two surviving episodes of Steed with his male partner. Long live the Avengers!
