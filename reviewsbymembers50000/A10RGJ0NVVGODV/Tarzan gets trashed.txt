 This rare serial and important addition to the Tarzan canon is totally ruined by the awful treatment giving to it in this DVD set. The picture quality is fair at best with most of it too dark or either too washed out. The sound is so bad that it's almost impossible to understand 90% of the dialogue through the loud sea of hiss. Save your money, this is a total rip-off.
