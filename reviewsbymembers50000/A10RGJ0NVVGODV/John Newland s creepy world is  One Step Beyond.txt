 Okay, so some of the prints aren't the best in world, but so what? It's "One Step Beyond" and we are finally getting to see more than a scattered episode here and there on DVD. VCI Entertainment did an excellent job of putting this DVD package together and I love the spooky DVD "landscape" created by VCI between the episodes. It's not just your average cheapie compliation of "here's the episodes with no money spent to set the mood." "Ordeal on Locust Street" is worth the price of admission alone, and John Newlands deadpan intos and outros run a close second to Rod Serling's. Sure, "One Step Beyond" has always been considered to be the poor man's "Twilight Zone," but that's part of it's charm. It's like a night of cheap thrills at a 1950's drive-in. I just hope VCI Entertainment is true to it's word and makes available future collections. So buy this set, sit back, and enjoy Collection #1 of "One Step Beyond."
