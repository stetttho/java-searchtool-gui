 Here you will find a cross between two cool Sixites sci-fi series. Lost In Space is sort of a combintion of the original Star Trek and the original Batman, there's just the right mix of comedy and drama. And what more could a viewer ask for than having the former Zorro and the former Timmy's Mom running around in tinfoil space suits? Okay, add a handsome spaceship pilot, three lovable kids, a comical villain, and a robot that looks like a washing machine. Oh, and let's not forget an alien monkey with big ears named Debbie. All this adds up to great fun and old-fashioned cliffhanger excitement in each episode. For the most part, the picture quality is sharp and clear and the sound is excellent. It's just too bad that the first season was shot in black and white and not out-of-this-world bright Sixties color like Star Trek and Batman. But never fear, the other two seasons were in color and will probably be coming to your TV screen in the near future. Buy this collection and you won't be disappointed. It will be fun for the whole family.
