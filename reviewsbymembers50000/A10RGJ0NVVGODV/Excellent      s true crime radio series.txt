 Lou Merrill is your host in this true crime radio series from the early  1950's which presents a look at each crime with a biting wit.  Some famous  crimes are covered like Lizzie Borden, but most are obscure. Don't worry,  each is well written and acted with excellent period music and wonderful  sound effects.  All 18 thirty-minute episodes in this nine hour collection  are fast-paced and very entertaining.  "Crime Classics" was one  of radio's greatest shows, and today these programs prove to be just as  fresh as they were 45 years ago. So if you like your crime straight up with  a twist of humor, "Crime Classics" is your cup of poison.
