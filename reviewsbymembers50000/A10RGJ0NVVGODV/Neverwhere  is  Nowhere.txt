 I bought this DVD set hoping for the best, unfortunately, I was disappointed. If you like blood, gore, senseless violence, and a lot of dirty people in rags running around in sewers and subways, then this might be your cup of tea. The hero is an incredibly clean-looking guy who looks and sounds like a young Paul McCartney. So Neverwhere ends up being "The Beatles Meet Dr. Who On A Bad Acid Trip." The storyline is only mildly entertaining and the ending is predictable. I'm really surprised that A&E would dredge up this BBC relic and try to pawn it off as "cult art" of the airwaves. Save your shillings and buy something worthwhile from the usually wonderful vaults of the BBC.
