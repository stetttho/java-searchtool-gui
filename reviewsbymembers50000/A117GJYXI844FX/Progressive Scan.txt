 This game can be played as a 4-way vs fighting game which is pretty unique as most are limited to 2 players. Another feature of this game is that it can output in 480p progressive scan (just hold down B when the cube appears on the screen during the system boot) even though it doesn't say it's progressive scan capable on the case.
