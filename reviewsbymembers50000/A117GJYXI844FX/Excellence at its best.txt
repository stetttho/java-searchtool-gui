 This is an excellent port of Sim City 2000 from the PC. City management fun at its best. If your squares are blue and green maybe your game is paused because you can build in pause mode (very useful at the beginning). Either that or you have no electricity in your zones and nobody wants to build there. If you've played Sim City on the SNES this is so much better in terms of graphics and building options. Really for the price you cannot beat it. This is a lot of fun to play on a commute and you can save whenever you want. If you've played Sim City expect more of the same city management fun you've grown to love. Very enjoyable and excellent value.
