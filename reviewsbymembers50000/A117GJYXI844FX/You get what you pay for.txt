 With this you are getting a controller (with turbo feature) a 4mb (small variety) memory card, and a controller extension cord. I found the controller worked fine for some games but other games were more sensitive and the controller did not callibrate properly. I ended up trading the controller in for a couple bucks. The memory card is too small to be useful.. nintendo even stopped making them of this size. The extension cord is the only thing I ever use from this pack now and better ones can be had cheaply. Don't waste your money. Stick with the genuine nintendo controllers and memory cards it's not worth the minimal cost savings buying this as it's not high quality anything.
