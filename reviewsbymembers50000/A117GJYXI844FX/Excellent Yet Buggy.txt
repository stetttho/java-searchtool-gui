 This is a five star game that I'm giving four stars to because of the bugs. Sure you may say all games have bugs especially rpgs but some of the bugs I'm seeing there's just no way any QA person could have missed them. There's no excuse for releasing a game with those kinds of bugs. That being said the bugs are not show stoppers. There are a lot of bugs but they are minor and the game is very playable. The graphics are excellent and the combat is challenging. Even though it's turn based the combat is quick (the exact opposite of PoR). Definitely reminds me of Baldur's Gate, and the character interface is very similar to Planescape: Torment.. which had one of the best. Items in the game have no descriptions and are bland. It's sad, really this game is excellent and has a lot of potential but it falls just short because it seems unfinished. Perhaps a patch will fix much of the problems but there are some design problems that they aren't likely to fix. Hopefully a sequel is in order using this engine with the problems worked out. A very enjoyable game as close to PnP as you can get.
