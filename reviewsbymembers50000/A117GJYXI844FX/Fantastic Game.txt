 I remember playing Final Fight in the arcade back in the day and loving it. This version is everything the original arcade version was and more. Compared to the snes version it's far superior, as the snes version didn't have guy and was missing the industrial area. This gba version not only has the missing area and guy, but also 2 bonus characters you can play as, alpha guy and alpha cody, also there are many cool settings you can unlock as you play other than the bonus characters. This is a great game and well worth the money, one of the best street fighting games in my opinion.
