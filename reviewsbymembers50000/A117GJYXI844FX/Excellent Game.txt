 Yea everything about this game is excellent. The graphics and sound are impressive, the gameplay is right on (several very good sets of controls). The tables are great and so are the boss battles; this game is very innovative. If you like pinball you MUST get this game. The physics in the game are excellent, and the long tables with scrolling are done very well.. nice and smooth and it does not interfere with game play at all. The innovation for the tables is that there are actual zombies and other critters moving about on the table.. hit them hard and the ball goes straight through.. hit them light and they can change the path of the ball. Mini-bosses can pop right out of the table and big ones are fought on mini-tables of their own once you unlock them. Excellent pinball game with great replay value.
