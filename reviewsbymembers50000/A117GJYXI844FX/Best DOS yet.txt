 I'm a big DOS games enthusiast and I've found PC DOS 2000 to be hands down the best version of DOS I've used. The best features of PC DOS 2000 are the amount of free conventional memory you can get compared to older versions, as well as the inclusion of ramboost, which is an excellent automated memory manager. I built another pc just for this OS (dual booted with win 2000 with no problems). Windows 3.x runs great in PC DOS 2000. I've been able to run many games perfectly that I haven't been able to run well or at all in almost 10 years. No problems running hardcore memory hungry games like Ultima VII. If you like DOS and you're using an older version do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.
