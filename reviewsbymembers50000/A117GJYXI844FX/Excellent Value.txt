 This controller is very good for what it is. If you need a usb controller for NES, SNES, or Playstation emulation, this is a good one to get. I bought two of them for NES/SNES emulation and I have no major complaints. This pad comes with a small joystick you can screw into the d-pad which is awkward and you'll never want to use. The only problem is that when you have the stick unscrewed, the center of the d-pad has a threaded metallic hole which can slightly irritate your thumb after a few hours of playing. Despite this minor flaw, while it's not the greatest controller you can buy, at this price it's an excellent value.
