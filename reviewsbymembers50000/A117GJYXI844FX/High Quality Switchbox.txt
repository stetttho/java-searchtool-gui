 I had my reservations at first about entrusting my optical and component video signals to a switchbox from one of the companies generally known for cheap (and not necessarily high quality) 3rd party gaming hardware.  I had first looked to buy a receiver but most didn't have nearly as many component video and optical inputs as this switchbox. As such, I ended up opting for the switchbox and sending the optical out to my audigy 2 patch bay for dolby 5.1 decoding. This switchbox turned out to be exactly what i needed and i've been extremely pleased with its performance and the value i got for the price.   I have a dvd player, gamecube, and x-box hooked up via component video (progressive scan), optical out of the x-box and dvd, rca out of the cube. Also have an n64, sfc, and a vcr hooked up via s-video and rca. I am using mid-range monster cables and I saw no degradation of quality while using this switchbox. I am also using the unit as an ethernet cable switch between the gamecube and the x-box (coming from my router).  All in all the unit looks very sleek, it comes with many inserts for labeling your channels and they glow green when selected, and it has an input in the front as well for quick hookup of a friend's game system or a camcorder, etc..  If a switchbox is what you need don't be afraid to buy this unit, it comes with quality cables and is well worth the money for its performance. Very handy for gamers with a lot of systems but a tv without a billion inputs.
