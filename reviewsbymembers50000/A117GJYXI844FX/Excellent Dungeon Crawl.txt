 This hack and slash dungeon crawl plays like the console version of the same name. You can be a human male fighter, archer, or wizard. The graphics are good for the gba and they pulled this title off surprisingly well. This is one of the few games I actually liked enough to play through. In my opinion there are WAY too many magic items and potions, to the point where if you crack open a barrel and there isn't a flaming burst adamantine longsword +5 in it it's a surprise, but who cares? This isn't a hardcore rpg like the baldur's gate for the pc (one of the best titles of all time). This is just a hack and slash dungeon crawl, and it does that very well. The locations are varied and interesting and you fight everything from kobolds, drow, frost giants, and even a beholder. Pick this title up and it will keep you entertained for many hours. Very enjoyable and a good D&D addition to the GBA.
