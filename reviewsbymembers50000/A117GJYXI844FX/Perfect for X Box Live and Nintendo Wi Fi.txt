 I agree with all the preceeding reviews. This router is extremely stable, has a fantastic range, the blue LEDs and black chromed finish are beautiful too. Best router I've ever owned.  I'm posting here to add that (once you upgrade to the 1.5 firmware) this router works great with BOTH X-Box Live and Nintendo Wi-Fi with no additional setup. I even enabled WEP and there were no problems connecting to either service, all I had to do was enter the WEP key on the Nintindo DS and it was ready to go. Be you a router configuring expert or a novice, you'll find this router meets and exceeds all your needs.
