 My son, as most babies, loves mirrors so I thought this book would be great.  However, the mirrors in this book are like fun house mirrors--the baby can't really see another baby face in it.  He has received this book twice, and both have this problem.  ALthough he likes the book, his favorite is another book with a "clear" mirror in it. Also, I'm not sure why some of the animals have names, and some are called by what they are.  Odd.   There are some Baby Einstein products that I love, but this is not one of them.
