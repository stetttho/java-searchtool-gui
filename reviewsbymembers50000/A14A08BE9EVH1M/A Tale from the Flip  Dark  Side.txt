 This is an adult version of the children's classic.  In addition to being a well-told story, it is thought provoking about real-world issues in a completely fantastical context.  For example, the entire concept for the story--the Wizard of Oz from the witch's point of view, highlights the importance of getting information from different sources, that things are not always what they seem.  This is a far cry from the simple, light, good vs. evil  children's story written by Frank Baum.  Complex issues such as discrimination, genocide, religion and fanatacism are all addressed (and not with positive outcomes) in this well-written story. The book loses its way in the desert while working up to the "Dorothy" conclusion, but is nevertheless a great read.  And for those who love the Oz stories, this version adds a new dimension, and makes you think about the old stories in new ways.  One of my favorite books!
