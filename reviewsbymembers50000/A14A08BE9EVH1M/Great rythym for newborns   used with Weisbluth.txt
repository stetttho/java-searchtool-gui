 I really liked the Babywhisperer before my son was born, and started him on EASY (eat, activity, sleep, you) from the get go.  This worked very well for us in the beginning.  Sleep collapsed at about week 6--and despite my instincts, I did not pursue the doctors.  We ended up with a reflux diagnosis at 6 months.  EASY probably saved us to some degree, because he was not eating and then going right to sleep--reflux babies are supposed to be upright about 20 minutes after eating.   Once we had his tummy sorted out, we had a week of the bad habits he learned through the reflux.  Then we switched to Weissbluth.  The great thing was 5 minutes of crying, and he was back to being the simple to put down baby he had been at the beginning.  I am convinced that the foundation we laid on the EASY method has created the great (touch wood) sleeping situation we have today!   I did not read this book to be rigid in scheduling--we were on a EASY with no time line schedule for a long time.  Also, I find the website to be an awesome resource.  Tons of moms who will post schedules, answer questions and give advice.  There you can even see that Tracy did have "flex" in her routines, and how to make it work so you can get that babt ti start off knowing how to sleep on his own, instead of having to learn it later.
