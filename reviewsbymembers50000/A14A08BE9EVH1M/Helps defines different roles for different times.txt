 As a older mother, I have read just about anything I can get my hands on regarding pregnancy, babies and parenting.  I found this book to be very useful in helping me (and my husband) understand what I can do to help my son grow up to be a strong and caring man.  For example, it explains when your son will cling to his mother, and when he will seek out a male role model and push his mother away.  Understanding that (I hope) will ease some of the stress of that time, and relieve the guilt that could hinder that transition for him.
