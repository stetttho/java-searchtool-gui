 The mystery in this movie is great...dark characters, and questions at every turn, along with a great ending!  However, I did not find the romance between Hepburn and Grant believable.  Their relationship seems forced, with the Hepburn character to bright to fall for the lame explanations that she is given by Grant's character.     I would have appreciated a less definitive ending with respect to their relationship, which would have been fine given how the mystery aspect of the story comes to a close.
