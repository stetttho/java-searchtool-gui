 Before parenthood, I can't say I was the healthiest of eaters.  However, recognizing the rising incidence of obesity in the US, I am determined to create a balanced eater in my son.    I liked this book because it explains how to prepare (for a baby) just about every vegetable ever grown.  Also, it gave me some ideas that I would have never thought of....such as adding avocado and kale to porridge (in my case, baby oatmeal--I couldn't fathom grinding).  Sounds gross, but my son LOVES it, and I feel good that he (now in an extremely picky stage) will eat it.  Using this book helped me figure out how to introduce vegetables into all of our diets.  There are typos, some inaccuracies, and she does go off on tangents.  But the reference (food by month, and vegetables by name) and recipe sections are great.  As with anything, use common sense.
