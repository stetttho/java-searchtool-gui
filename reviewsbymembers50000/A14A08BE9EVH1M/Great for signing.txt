 If you are using sign language with your child, this is a great book!  It is more of a picture book, but there are great opportunities to sign gorilla (monkey, banana and key on every page, as well as some good concepts for kids like "light" and "sleep."    Even if you aren't signing, this book is fabulous.  There are opportunities to identify animals and colors on every page, as well as finding the mouse and his banana.
