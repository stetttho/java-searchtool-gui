 I have been listening to Carrie's music for more than 10 years now, and have introduced many many people to her music.  Instead of picking the album that best fits the person, I will be keeping a couple of "Betty's" on hand.  It contains some of the best of her other albums.  That said, some real gems are missing--but at 17 tracks, how many more could she have chosen?
