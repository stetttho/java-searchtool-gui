 As a thirty-something pregnant with my first, I had every book under sun.  This one made me laugh so hard that my already compressed bladder had to struggle! This book is great for a funny look at pregnancy.  For example, it instructs husbands in no uncertain terms that a gift should be given to his wife upon the delivery of the child.  The section on urgency of bathroom use made both my husband and I laugh, because I too had been ready to fling myself from a moving vehicle to "go."  For the most part the book made me laugh.  When it got a little more "serious," like in the section on maternity clothes, it wasn't very helpful (or funny). This book is a great break from the standard books on pregnancy.  If you are looking for factual info, look elsewhere.
