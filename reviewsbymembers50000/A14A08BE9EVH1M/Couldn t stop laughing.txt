 The Church of England has only recently begun allowing women to be vicars.  When my now husband and I decided to affirm our vows in his parent's church, we were pleased to be working with one of the first female vicars in the country.  She related to us some of the challenges she faced, and said her life mirrored the vicar of dibley in many ways.... The series is hilarious top to bottom.  Some of the episodes contain mature themes that may not be suitable for children.  Be sure to watch for the joke after the credits... b
