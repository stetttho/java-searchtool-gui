 Kids love this movie for the talking chickens and their attempts to fly along with the creative rats...adults love this movie for the subtle humor and gentle jabs at other movie classics. If you are looking for a movie for all ages, this is one to fit the bill. And, it doesn't forget to examine the question, "Which came first?" A real pleasure, with little (if anything) to offend.
