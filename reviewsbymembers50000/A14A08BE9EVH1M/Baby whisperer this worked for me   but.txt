 I was a strong advocate of the "Baby Whisperer," and started my son on the "EASY" (Eat, Activity, Sleep, You) method from the get go.  It worked seemingly well, because he did not need to nurse himself to sleep. During the first month, I often laid him down awake, with no problems.  Then we entered HE**, and for the next 5 months, never got a night of sleep, and at the end, he was up 4-5-6-7 times a night.    The problem--reflux.  Once he was diagnosed, and had been on medication for a while, he had the bad habits that we all learned when his tummy had hurt so much.  After we were sure it wasn't his tummy anymore, we left him to cry it out.  Five minutes of crying later, he fell asleep, and hasn't had a real problem since.  Now, I use this book when his sleep patterns are changing to help me help him to sleep.
