 I had several different baby books to choose from before my son was born, and this is the one I went with.  I'm not thrilled with the pictures printed in the book, but it is so easy to fill out (and you can always stick your own pics over theirs)!  It also has lots of pockets to stick small mementos in.  There is plenty of room for pictures.  We even took it with us to the hospital to have his footprint stamped in. The bulk of the book is for the first year, but the small sections for age 1-5 still have some of the "workbook" concept, to help you capture most of the important moments as they grow.
