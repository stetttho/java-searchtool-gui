 I found this book to be mesmerizing, not only for the writing, but because the the voice of the 12 year old female narrator was so convincing.  At a reading, I was startled to discover that the author of this compelling read was a man.  In response to the question,"How did you write in the voice of a 12 year old GIRL," he responded,"research." And once he thought he had it, he went back and confirmed it with the daughters of midwives he had talked to.  But to have captured the insecurity and inner thoughts of a girl in that place is amazing, not to mention the context she finds herself in. I have not read many "Oprah" books, and have not enjoyed several of those I have picked up.  This one, however, I could not put down.  I have recommended it to many people, and even my 55-year-old uncle enjoyed it.
