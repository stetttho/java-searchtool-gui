 My son lights up and laughs when he sees this book.  He loves the peekaboo concept, but giggles even harder when mommy gets the sound "wrong."   If you are signing with your child, this book provides a great opportunity to reinforce the sign with the animal sound. One note, my niece was scared of this book when she first got it.  We think it was the was the eyes are drawn...but who knows! Highly recommended.
