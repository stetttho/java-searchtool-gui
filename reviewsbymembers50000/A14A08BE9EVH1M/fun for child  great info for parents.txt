 Signing Smart is an ASL-based program that emphasizes learning and teaching signs to your child through play and everyday life.  The video that goes with this program is great.   It has children and a bear doing many basic signs with lots of real world images. (By the way, you will not want to full your hair outbecause of the soundtrack on this one!)  My son loves to watch this video with me, and it is easy to pull out toys and items that match what is going on in the video to help make the connection.  The many children in the video are signing and can help parents know what to watch for. At the end of the video there is a tips for parents section which both my husband and I have found useful.  It emphasizes different ways to connect the sign and what it signifies for your child.  Again, it shows more (very young) children actually doing signs to help us parents know that "when I flap my hand this way, it means bear." I have some other signing videos, but this is the one my son enjoys the most, and makes it the easiest for me to interact with him.
