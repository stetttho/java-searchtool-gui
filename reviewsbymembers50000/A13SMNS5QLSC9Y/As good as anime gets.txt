 I often think of Akira as the Citizen Kane of anime--the classic of the medium, the standard by which all others are judged.  Ghost in the Shell becomes a sort of Star Wars, a futuristic, special-effects-laden masterpiece. By this standard, Samurai X/Rouroni Kenshin is the Saving Private Ryan of anime--a brutally realistic portrait of war and its effects on the souls of the men who wage it.  I have never given an anime title five stars before.  To do so implies that it could stand with the aforementioned films, and it was impossible to think that any anime could be that good.  Samurai X is.  Everything, from the visuals to the story to the music, is brilliant.  That it is also educational is even more remarkable.  Kenshin, when judged by both this video and the TV series, is probably the best anime character ever created, an incredibly skilled swordsman who knows that he kills but does not yet understand what that means.  All of the other characters, too, are well-done and seem to get better with every viewing. If there is any flaw at all it is in the dubbing.  I prefer dubbed anime and rarely notice the kind of problems with it other people do.  However, in Samurai X I did not like the voice actress who played Tomoe.  This is probably because I recognized her voice from an episode of Goldenboy, in which she plays a vampy schoolgirl.  She was great in that, but every time I heard her voice in Samurai X I kept hearing the dialogue from Goldenboy and it was distracting. This, however, is not even close to a reason not to own this video.  If you like anime, then I cannot recommend Samurai X highly enough.  It is truly spectacular.
