 This is not a great video.  For one thing, it is only one half-hour episode.  Worse, it is basically a rip-off of Devil Hunter Yohko (which cannot be a surprise, with a title like that), only not as good.  It is not as funny, nor are the fights as good.  About the only thing going for this video is that it has a healthy dose of nudity, more than Yohko.  I don't regard this title as a complete waste for that reason, but there are videos that succeed in that department and also have more going for them, like Cutey Honey.  Get that before you bother with this.
