 I read all the glowing reviews for Kevin Smith's Daredevil (Daredevil Visionaries Vol. V) and felt compelled to write. Make no mistake, everyone; this is what Kevin Smith tried so desperately, and failed so completely, to imitate. This is the quintessential Daredevil story. Here he contends with the Kingpin, who is catapulted from his early days in Spider-Man comics to the elite of Marvel evil. The story opens with the Kingpin learning Daredevil's secret identity as Matt Murdoch (the blind attorney). It is not enough to merely kill him, though, so he begins the process of systematically destroying Matt's life. When that is done he arranges Matt's death, disgracing him even further, and Kingpin's victory is complete. But only then does he realize he hasn't won at all. Someone once said that the measure of a hero is in the strength of his villains. After reading this there will be no question that Daredevil is one of the best heroes in Marvel comics. His rise from defeat is as stirring as anything I've read in comics, and I've read a lot, believe me. And I don't imagine many female readers could see this and not come away with the impression that DD would make a better boyfriend than most other superheroes. David Mazzuchelli, not Frank Miller, handles the art in this comic, but I don't think you'll be disappointed. Miller's art is great but can be a bit too stylistic. Mazzuchelli is more of a classic comic book artist, and he knows how to draw a fight. On a side note, Miller wrote the best Batman story and here gives us the best Daredevil. But he also gives us, in this volume, the best portrayal of Captain America I've ever seen. (Cap's best line ever: "He wears the flag." Read it and you'll understand. And remember, DD can't see colors!) This is definitely one of my five favorite comic book stories (along with Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Watchmen, Squadron Supreme, and the Alan Moore Supreme issues). I cannot recommend this highly enough.
