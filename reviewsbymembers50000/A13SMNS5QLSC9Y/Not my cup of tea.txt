 Reading An American Dream is sort of like reading Shakespeare; you eventually start wondering if people actually talked like that.  Of course, the time period of this book is just a few decades ago (the early 1960s), so it's hard to believe they did.  There's a conversation between main character Rojack and a jazz singer named Shago Martin that is almost completely nonsensical.  The narration of the book (by Rojack) is not much better, filled with lines that sound profound until you actually think about them.  Like this little gem: "There was pain now in the sound, and such a truth in the grief that I knew she was crying not for Deborah, not even quite for herself, but rather for the unmitigatable fact that women who have discovered the power of sex are never far from suicide." Uh... right.  The other factor of this book that crippled my ability to enjoy it was the fact that Rojack is a completely unsympathetic character.  He's not a bad person, just totally amoral.  He never seems to do anything because it's the right thing to do; he just does whatever he wants to do, justifying his actions with quasi-philosophical nonsense.  I found myself hoping the police would actually get some proof he murdered his wife and put him away. Still, I'm aware this is regarded as an extraordinary novel by literary types, and given that, it's probably worth a chance.  There's a quote on the back from a review in Harper's that says, "A work of fierce concentration."  If you can figure out what that means, you might also be able to figure out this book.
