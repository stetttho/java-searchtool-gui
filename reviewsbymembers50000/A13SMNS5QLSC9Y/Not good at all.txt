 This volume of Kenshin is just lousy.  Most people know that after the Kyoto storyline the anime deviates from the comic on which it was originally based.  (The comic was not finished yet, so the anime creators had to come up with material on their own.)  I had hopes going into the Christian story that it would retain at least some of the flavor of the previous stories.  Sadly, this was not the case. They tried, though, so the first two DVDs in that story arc, Son of God and Holy War, were at least watchable.  But with Fall From Grace, things have really come apart at the seams.  The part that is most painful for me is that nothing is explained.  Kenshin fights used to be cool because there was a reason why one fighter would beat another.  In the Christian arc there is no explanation for why one person wins, or how different attacks work.  We don't learn why Kenshin went blind, or how he gets cured.  When Kenshin and Shougo have their big final match, it's just them simultaneously attacking and one comes out on top.  Why did that person win?  I have no idea. That's all in the first episode.  The second deals with the aftermath of the Christian story.  I guess if you were really interested you would like it, but I couldn't care less.  The third episode is actually pretty good, about a guy using the name Battousai (Kenshin's nickname when he was a killer) to get money.  Why does he do this?  Is he actually good with a sword?  You'll have to watch and see.  The fourth and last episode concerns a trip to a hot springs resort that results in an artist declaring his love for Kaoru.  I'm of the opinion there is no such thing as a bad hot springs episode, but they could have thrown in some shots of Sanosuke undressed for the female fans. Overall, this was not a completely terrible DVD, but the quality of Rurouni Kenshin has taken a nosedive since the Kyoto arc ended.  I will probably keep buying out of loyalty, but I really can't recommend this volume to others.
