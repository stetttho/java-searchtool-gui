 Even slightly disappointing, with this video, is still head and shoulders above most anime.  There is absolutely no drop in quality from the first video.  There is a little less action in this tape (almost none in the first episode), but this is not bad at all; I was almost shaking with anticipation of when Kenshin would start killing again.  The character development is more important here, and it is well done.  So what didn't I like about this video?  It's almost impossible to say without giving away something.  All I can tell you is that at it didn't quite seem to completely bridge the gap between the first Samurai X and the Rouroni Kenshin TV series. Don't interpret this as a real negative, though.  As drawbacks go, leaving you wanting more is hardly the worst sin the creators could commit.  I heartily recommend this video to anyone who saw the first Samurai X or the TV series, and if you like anime and aren't familiar with Kenshin, I recommend all of them.
