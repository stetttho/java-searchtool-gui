 I can't help comparing this movie to Fatal Fury, since they have similar animation styles and were probably made by the same people.  If you liked  FF, you MIGHT like this one. If what you liked about FF were the  animation, character designs, and fight scenes, you will probably like  this.  Also, Voltage Fighters portrays its women the same as FF, that is,  with lots of big bouncing breasts and gratuitous nudity.  If you like this  (as I wholeheartedly do) then this could be the movie for you.  (If you  don't I don't think anime is the hobby for you.) If, however, you liked  Fatal Fury because it had a well-developed plot, you might want to steer  clear of this.  The basic story is that there are good guys and bad guys  (though which is which is not always clear), the bad guys want to destroy  the earth, and the good guys want to stop them.  If there was more to it  than that (like, say, a reason for any of it) then I missed it  completely. For all its failings, though, this is a Japanese animation.   Like almost all of them, it is a primarily visual treat, and in that way  it's not half bad.
