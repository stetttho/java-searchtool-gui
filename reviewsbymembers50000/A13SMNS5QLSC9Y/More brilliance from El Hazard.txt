 This is the third volume of El-Hazard, and in my opinion it surpasses the first two tapes.  The only thing really lacking earlier in the series was a sense of interest in the characters.  I enjoyed watching them, but I didn't really feel anything for them as people. This tape makes you care.  It is also pivotal in that it introduces Ifurita, the "Demon God" with the big chest and the rather shocking penchant for destruction.  Jinnai manages to awaken her, and minutes later commands her to destroy the allied nations that are at war with the Bugrom.  This she begins to do, by hovering over a large city and obliterating it with a single energy blast.  After the lightheartedness of the first tapes, in which no one really got hurt, this was almost disturbing.  The drama melds well with the comedy, though, resulting in a series that covers all bases.  I highly recommend this tape to all anime fans.
