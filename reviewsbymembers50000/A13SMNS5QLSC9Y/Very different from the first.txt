 Having enjoyed the first Sakura Diaries immensely, I eagerly awaited this  volume.  For the first half of volume 2 I was quite pleased, as there were  several scenes that were laugh-out-loud funny.  Midway through, however,  the story took a decidedly not-funny turn.  I don't want to spoil it, but I  must say I was rather disturbed by this.  I did think it was well handled,  but be prepared for it.  You'll know it when it happens, and it is NOT a  fantasy sequence. I can't wait for the next one to come out, though.
