 Devil Hunter Yohko starts out as the lighthearted tale of an average teenage girl.  Very rapidly we learn that she's not so average after all.  Namely, she's so desperate to lose her virginity she'll go to bed with the first cute guy willing to pay for a hotel room.  This is actually a pretty interesting situation of role-reversal.  If it were a boy who wanted sex so bad he'd sleep with any willing female, no one would think twice about it.  Since it's a girl, though, it seems strange and funny and sexy. Of course, with a title like that you know there's more to it than the normal anime romantic hijinks.  Yohko finds out she can't have sex without putting the world in jeopardy from invading demons.  This sets up another role-reversal, when she must save a boy from a marauding female demon. I couldn't honestly say whether a girl would like this anime or not.  I think most girls would like Yohko, but there is some gratuitous nudity.  Of course, most guys will like this.  The video is funny and the action is decent.  I recommend that you at least check out this first tape.
