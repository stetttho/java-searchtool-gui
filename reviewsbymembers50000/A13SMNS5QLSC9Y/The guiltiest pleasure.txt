 If the exploitation of women is something you object to, avoid this video at all costs.  The makers of this movie have a serious panty fetish, and there is visible women's underwear in virtually every frame.  Personally, I liked it.  The women are well-drawn and sexy, especially Aika herself.  Aika has a magical golden bustier which is actually semi-sentient and gives her offensive and defensive abilities.  (This is so similar to the comic book Witchblade that I wonder if one of them plagiarized the other.)  The story involves her recovery of a piece of lost technology (she works as an underwater salvager) and a villain's plans for it.  It's all pretty silly, but generally funny.  If you're a guy who's into anime and likes women in skimpy outfits, this is a good choice.
