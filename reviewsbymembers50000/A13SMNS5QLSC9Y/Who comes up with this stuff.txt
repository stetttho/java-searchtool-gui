 I don't know anything about the game this video is based on.  I bought the video because there was a buxom babe on the cover and it said "17+".  (If this makes me a pig, so be it.)  After a few minutes I learned the basis of the movie, namely, waitresses are fighting in a tournament.  The winner gets money; the loser has to take off her clothes.  My first thought on learning this was the intelligent and well-thought-out query: "Whut the--?!" As I watched more, I can't say the premise made a whole lot more sense, but the movie was decent.  The animation was surprisingly good and the fights were cool, though nowhere near the level of Street Fighter II: TAM.  The story was actually pretty good, too, better than SF2 or Fatal Fury: TMP.  The movie also benefitted from who I consider a very cool villain.  This was Damien, the long-limbed, misshapen psychopath whose drug-induced speed and strength make him more than a match for the fighters of the tournament.  My only real complaint (and here comes my piggishness again) was that there was not as much nudity as I might have hoped.  The main character, Yuka, is absolutely gorgeous but never takes it all off.  Bummer. Still, this was a good title and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't need anime to be as thoughtful as Akira to enjoy watching it.
