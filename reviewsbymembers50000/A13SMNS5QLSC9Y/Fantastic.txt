 This is an amazing movie, mainly because of the character study Paul Newman portrays.  A Few Good Men may have had better courtroom dialogue, but I guarantee you will root for Newman more than you did for Cruise and Moore in that movie.  Newman is amazing, absolutely at the top of his game.  The Hustler is still, I think, his best movie, but this is his best performance, and his supporting cast is great, too.  I can't recommend this movie enough.
