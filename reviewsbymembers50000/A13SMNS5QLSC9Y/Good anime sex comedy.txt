 After the freakish twist of the second volume, Sakura Diaries gets back on track with this tape.  There are still some tense moments, but we are mostly treated to what made me love the series, humor and innocent sexuality.  This volume ups the amount of nudity a bit, so this is definitely not for kids, but adult fans of Japanese animation should like this just fine.
