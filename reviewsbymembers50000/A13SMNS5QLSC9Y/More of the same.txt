 This video is pretty much just like the first Aika title, Naked Mission.  There are women's panties all over the place and the occassional nudity.  The story is ripped right out of Moonraker.  There's a villain bent on destroying the world and repopulating it with his own children, which he will father with the chicks he brought into space with him.  It's fairly funny, particularly the character Gusto, who has one of the most interesting voices I've heard on anime.  If you liked the first one or like anime with lots of babes, this is a good pick.
