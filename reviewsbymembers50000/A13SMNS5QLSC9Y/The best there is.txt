 I'm not sure if any work of fiction, comic or otherwise, has ever affected  me as deeply as Watchmen.  If you don't read comics I would still recommend  this to you, and if you do read them and haven't read this, then shame on  you.   As for comments some make about the book being dated (nuclear war  is no longer a constant fear, etc.), I disagree.  If you were alive during  the Cold War or even just have a decent understanding of the period,  Watchmen will still affect you.  After all, World War II is long over, but  brilliant films continue to be made about it.
