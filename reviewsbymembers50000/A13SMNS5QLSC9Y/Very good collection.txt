 Most of the stories in this collection of hybrid science fiction/horror are good, with a few standouts.  "The Colour out of Space" by H. P. Lovecraft is tough to get through but has some of the most genuinely creepy moments in the book.  "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr. (the basis for the two movies titled "The Thing" -- the creature is even referred to as "the Thing" in the story) is good but the science occasionally lost me; and at fifty-seven pages I would have liked a little more character development.  (I could hardly tell one person from another.)  "They" by Robert Heinlein, about a man who imagines everyone is out to get him, is intriguing.  "A Walk in the Dark" by Arthur C. Clarke explores the idea that humanity will never entirely forget the fear of darkness, and is very good.  "The Father-Thing" by Philip K. Dick is a scary one.   "Born of Man and Woman" by Richard Matheson didn't work for me; it's only four pages long and I spent the entire time trying to get used to the unconventional style.  (It's written in a simplistic, childlike fashion that fits the subject but is still awkward.)  The short-short story "Hell-Fire" by Isaac Asimov is hardly more than one page but still throws an interesting idea at you.  David Morell's "Orange Is for Anguish, Blue for Insanity" is very good but strangely feels as though it could have been even better.  It's about a painter who loses a friend to the study of a mad artist and wants to learn why.  And finally, "The Age of Desire" by Clive Barker is truly disturbing.  It mixes gore and sexuality in a way that I won't be forgetting any time soon. The rest of the stories are decent but I'm less familiar with the authors.  One side note: all of the writers featured here, as well as all of the main characters, are men.  Overall I recommend this collection to both science fiction and horror fans.
