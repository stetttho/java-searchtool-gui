 I liked this video a lot.  I didn't really know what to expect, but it turned out to be a lot like Goldenboy, which I loved.  The situations are  goofy and funny, and Touma overreacts to all of it.  Uraru's innocent  sexuality was pretty good, too.  I recommend this video to anyone who  enjoys the funnier anime, like Ranma 1/2.
