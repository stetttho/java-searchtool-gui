 It was very difficult for me to decide how to rate this video and what to write about it.  On the one hand, it is probably not for everyone, not even for all anime fans.  However, ultimately I must tell you about how much I liked it myself. I'm not even sure I can do that.  To describe how much I like Revolutionary Girl Utena is probably impossible.  It is, quite simply, the finest fictional work I have ever come across.  No book I've ever read, no movie I've ever seen, no video game I've ever played has affected me as deeply as this.  My hobby for fifteen years was collecting comic books.  Recently I have moved more towards Japanese animation.  Most recently of all, Revolutionary Girl Utena has become almost a hobby by itself.  It is absolutely addictive, and once you get into the series you will go nuts trying to see all of it.  The source of this madness is the simple fact that you will root for the two main characters, Utena and Anthy, more than anything you can imagine.  You cannot help but want them to happy at the end of the series (which by the way has 39 total episodes), and you will be driven to see whether they are. As for this first tape, it brilliantly sets up all that is to follow.  There are four episodes, which introduce almost all of the major characters.  There is drama and romance aplenty, and one of the funniest episodes in the series.  I cannot recommend enough that you at least try out this first tape.  After that, you will be hooked, and there is no going back.
