 If you liked the first El-Hazard: The Magnificent World, The World of Endless Adventure, you're sure to like this one. Our hero, Makoto, having agreed to portray the lost princess Fatora, sets off to Mt. Muldoon with his teacher Fujisawa and...Alielle.  They encounter two of the three priestesses they are looking for (the priestesses being the only ones who can activate the Eye of God, necessary to defend Roshtaria), but things don't go as planned and they have to make another journey after that to find the priestesses again. This tape is just as funny as the first one, as well as just as beautiful.  The three priestesses are great, especially Miz Mishtal, the mistress of water so desperate to land a husband she instantly falls for the alcoholic Fujisawa.  Alielle is in heaven with so many babes to choose from, and Makoto is in hell trying to hide his identity from the women.  On a side note, I think the English voice-acting is especially good in this series (you may recognize voices of Major Kusanagi, the Puppetmaster, and Ken Masters from other anime). I love the El-Hazard series and strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys anime.  You won't be disappointed.
