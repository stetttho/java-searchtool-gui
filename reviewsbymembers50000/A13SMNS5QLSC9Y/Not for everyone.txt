 I liked this movie quite a bit, but the friend I watched it with didn't.  The story is very strange, almost incomprehensible at times.  I generally don't like it when computer animation in mixed in, but here it actually worked pretty well.  If you like computer animation and don't mind your anime being pretty weird I would recommend this tape.  Also, keep in mind that some of the other reviews posted for this animated movie were actually referring to the live-action film produced by the same director.
