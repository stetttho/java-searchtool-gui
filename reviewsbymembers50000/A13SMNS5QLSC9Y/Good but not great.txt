 This was a decent title all-around.  The robot combat is nothing spectacular but is not bad.  There's some strong language in this video.  The voice-acting is not exactly top-notch.  The girls are kind of ditsy, but it's done for laughs and is fairly funny.  The villain is as despicable as any I've seen in anime so far.  He's very brutal to women, but actually has a semi-logical reason for the things he does (though that's not revealed until a later volume).  The most noteworthy aspect of this video is the nudity.  The women get naked quite a bit, and it's up to you to decide whether this is for you.  Personally, I loved it.  There's also some lesbian innuendo.  Overall I've seen much better movies, but if you're looking for a decent sci-fi anime with a lot of naked women, this is a good pick.
