 This video is pretty much like the first volume of Kekko Kamen.  To wit, a psychotic school principal called the Toenail of Satan abuses his students, particularly a cute young girl named Miami, and is opposed by Kekko Kamen, a superheroine who wears a mask, gloves, and boots but is otherwise naked. If that wasn't enough to make your decision for you, well, I don't know what else to tell you.  The video is very funny but you're not going to learn any life lessons from it.  Specifically, the first episode here concern a new student whom Miami falls for but who may not be what she seems, and the second is about a guy hired to humiliate bad students by photographing them nude.  All in all, this could be the silliest anime ever made, as well as one of the most expoitive, but it's funny, so who cares?
