 This is an OK book. It really doesn't delve with any details other than a summary of an action that took place. With 100 stories in one book, each is about 3 pages or less, so it's a good reference book to obtain names of people involved and be able to read more in depth about them elsewhere. You could go through this book in a day. I'd recommend the Skorzeny biography "Commando Extraordinaire" (or something like that) as a great read, he alone was in the middle of about 20 exciting missions that in one book can be dealt with some details and insight. I see his books are hard to find, I guess any Nazi is a bad person but his story is full of excitement. Hell, they are making all these revisionist stories and movies about Hitler (truly an evil man) why not make a movie about Skorzeny?
