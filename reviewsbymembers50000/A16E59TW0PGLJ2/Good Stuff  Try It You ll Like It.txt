 Well, ok maybe not since I have not heard this cd (shame on me). But I was reading all of these people slamming Seagal who also have not heard this cd and than I thought of other actors who did cd's, like Jammie Foxx and Eddie Murphey. I wonder if anyone slammed them? Or is it that white people typecast their own race in a box and blacks are more open minded to realize that people can be multi-talented. BTW, I allways thought Seagal was a horrible actor because of one or two of his films but in reflection I have been very entertained by his films, he also doesn't seem to have a head so big that he can't play a great support role. If Mr Seagal got Stevie Wonder to help him out on this than it's a serious release and I hope it sells well overseas (ie. Asia) and he continues to rake in the big bucks. Favorite Seagal moment was he was on a Fox News daytime show and said the "F" word thinking he was off the air, he gives Shepered Smith this timid look and says "We are off the air right?" Smith says, "no but we will be soon", true story!
