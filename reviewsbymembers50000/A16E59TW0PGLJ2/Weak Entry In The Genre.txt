 I purchased this game for a couple of bucks so had nothing to lose, but I have to disagree with the 5 and 4 star reviews here. This game has no control compared to other RTS games I have played and I didn't see any point wasting any more of my time with it after 2 or 3 hours. There are a lot more challenging and fun games out there!
