 I saw Elvis Costello about the time of this album, he put on a show well over 2.5 hours that was absolutly amazing. Talk Talk was even the warm up to a small crowd under 2,000, man what a great night! I have purchased numerous Costello albums, cassettes over the years all gone now, and have purchased a lot of his comilation CD's. I need to get Trust back on CD because this is just such a great CD and there are a lot of great tunes not on the compilation's. You can tell it's great because no one is selling there's on amazon! LOL
