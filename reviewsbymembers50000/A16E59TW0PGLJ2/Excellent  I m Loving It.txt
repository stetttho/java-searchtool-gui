 Over the last 6 months I decided to buy all of Elvis's releases because I've always been a big EC fan and was tired of my 100 songs I had on earlier compilations. For an artist who put out so much material, it's amazing that I like over 80% of it and listen to it repeatedly. I've been soaking up Imperial Bedroom, Punch the Clock, Goodbye Cruel World (yes even that one!), and others when I finally got around to When I was Cruel. Man I am really, really enjoying this release. It, for me, maintains that EC can go head to head with the new groups who put out one or two excellent songs with crappy filler; this cd is solid great modern listening. It sounds like it's from 2002 also so that's another reason why I'm so happy, because I'll never forget the 80's but its great that Elvis is up with the times when he wants to be. Excellent purchase, I'm so happy it's going for so cheap used because this CD is one of his best in 15 years.
