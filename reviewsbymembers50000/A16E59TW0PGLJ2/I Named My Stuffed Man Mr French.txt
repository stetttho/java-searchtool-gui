 I would watch this show in the day (probably in reruns but it was waaaay back in the preschool to 1-3 grade days of the late 60's early 70's). I really remember this show  and coming from not an ideal family myself I guess this was good therapy to watch because these kids are not in a "normal" family either. Mr. French was my big favorite and I had this wierd stuffed cloth doll (like a teddy bear but a man) and I named him Mr. French, I used to sleep with him and I'm sure it was a big comfort. Thanks Family Affair for all the entertainment and comfort you brought me in my not so ideal childhood. Another memory, the true fear I felt when the kids ran away, remember that one? This show really had me careing for the characters, great show!
