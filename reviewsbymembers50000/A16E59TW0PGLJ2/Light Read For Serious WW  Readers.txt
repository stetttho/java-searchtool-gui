 I purchased and just got a used copy of this hardcover edition book and was very surprised. It is pretty light on the words and very very heavy on photos. I bought this after reading "Reach For The Sky" the biography of Bader's war years, a highly recommended book. This I guess since it's autobiographical, and Bader not wanting to crow to loudly talks a little about himself and a little about his fellow pilots. Its about 180 pages long and I'd say has about half of that with solid text and half filled with cool photos, many in colour. A worthwhile book but didn't really enlighten any past "Reach For The Sky". A good chapter on Hurricat's though, Hurricanes that were rocket catapulted off merchant ships decks to defend against Condor bombers. The pilot would have to bail out after action because not enough fuel to reach land! Desperate times and all that, eh old boy?
