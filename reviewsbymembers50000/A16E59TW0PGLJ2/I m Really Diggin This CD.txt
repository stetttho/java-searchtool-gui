 My Talk Talk days start in 1982 when they were warm up for Elvis Costello at Orlando. The auditorium was 1/4 full for the warm up and I wish I had moved up front as I did for Costello (who was amazing, played it seemed like 3 hours). Talk Talk really had me wanting to move my feet with music from their first album (to bad I didn't have a date :-( ). I got the "cassette" (yes those days, lol), and played that thing out (actually traded it from a guy for I think a Duran Duran tape, lol). I was hooked on that first album "The Party's Over", but really found a strong groove that continues 20 years later with the discs "It's my Life" and "Colour Of Spring", I also bought "Spirit Of Eden" but was like wow, I'm not into this at all. Sans present day, I am looking for their first disc after missing it for 20 years after the tape wore out and discover "Asides, Besides", what a great investment! For me now I have all the Talk Talk I want, this disc has all the songs from "Spirit" I enjoy plus alternate (which I LOVE) and remix tracks (interesting, some better than others) of my favorite 3 discs. I could recommend this for someone looking to invest in only one cd from the group that this be the one and for Talk Talk fans its great material to augment the stuff you already own and have probably listened to for 20+ years like me. Since I have gotten this collection a couple of months ago, I havn't really played the originals, it's that good!
