 I purchased two Invicta's after watching some watch show sale on tv late night (god, I hate when I do that). But for the price I figured it was worth the risk. I had a serious Rolex urge and this was what I could afford. Anyway the watches were boxed in nice yellow leather boxes and at first looked awesome, but it became appearent they were knock off quality. One watch was a yachmaster type and from the start the small dials didn't work right and the dial's paint wore off, the other one was a titanium model and the movement just kinda felt and looked cheesy. I gave em both to my then 12 year old who promptly "lost" them (probably got mugged at school), but I shed no tears. I got my Rolex soon after (a "cheap" used one, although not a Sub) and even though it was like 15 years old its now over 20 years old and running well, I just dont want to wear it everyday. I'm getting a Seiko 007 and crossing my fingers it has better craftmanship than Invicta (twice the price also but still a fraction of a Rolex). I would advice waiting a week, save a few more dollars, and getting a Casio, Seiko, or Pulsar over an Invicta.
