 I just had to chime in because I ALMOST put down my loose change for a Nina compilation, I'm always a sucker for all these 5 star Amazon reviews and I had heard of her growing up in NYC in the late 70's-81. But thank God, Amazon also has the tracks to sample because I now remember how Nina was never played at the clubs I would go to unless maybe it was freak night, or I guess this would play well at an S&M club. I was just thinking if they used her music in the movie Eurotrip when the dude is in Amsterdam and the hot S&M dominatrix ties him down and all the muscle bound dudes pop out and you know what happens next, lol. Nina had to have been the music for a scene like that. I'm not against "weird" stuff, or German stuff (I own Lene Lovich, and Kraftwerk), I'm just not into music that is weird for the sake of being weird unless it sounds good. Not trying to put down Nina, she obviously has her fans; I'm just posting this for people new to her stuff so they get a little balance, definitely listen to the samples first to see if this is for you.
