 I don't want to think Elvis fans are only hicks without computers, but I'm starting to get that picture (myself excluded, lol). Why is everyone voting no on the posts that say this disc wont play on computers? This disc will not play in my computer and I am overseas with the troops so thanks a lot BMG Sony. This should be a MAJOR issue for consumers now that things like I Pods and mp3 players (that is what I also use) are becoming more popular. I'm stuck with a disc that I can't use on the media that I use, just be aware before you buy this, I tried alternate players and the disc is not even recognized in the drive. Luckily I followed the advice at electronic freedom foundation and disabled autoplay on my drive before I attempted to play this because it also may have put a rootkit on my cpu leaving it open to attacks. I hope BMG Sony get their arses sued to DEATH over this and that it is a lesson to them not to do this crap without some notices (I don't see anything anywhere on this disc that it wont play on a computer). I have bought a TON of music on Amazon because being in the middle east it's my main form of entertainment, I'm not a hacker or ripping off people but if I want to share this music with my family I should be allowed to do that, shouldn't I? Or how about just play the freaking disc? This is total crap and I'm pissed I hope I get one of those class action lawsuit things in the mail and make some lawyers very rich! BMG Sony if they are worried about profits should focus on talent and let the marketplace decide whats good not PAYOLA AND SCREWED UP DISCS! Amazon needs to take a stand in this too since they are computer related (they only do business on the internet, that's their claim to fame), how do you feel Amazon about selling music that won't play in your customers computers? I don't see any warnings on this site, just user comments. Amazon better take a stand or they are going down a notch in my book.
