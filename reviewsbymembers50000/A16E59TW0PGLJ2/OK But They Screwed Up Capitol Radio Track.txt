 The Clash, on retrospect for me were very cool, and I still listen to this set now, being 41 (although not everyday, once in a while). Like others have said the songs are all mish mashed out of order, so thats why the 4 stars, but also they put an interview on the same track with Capitol Radio. Why? The interview is on the front of the track and it's longer than the song! Plus the interview sucks! The audio is horrible and its like the guys rambling on while on a train. I like the song Capitol Radio a lot too because I think they are refering to a pirate radio station that broadcast off a ship in the waters off New York when I was living there late 70'sh. That station was awesome playing punk and early new wave rock while stations like WPLJ played Led Zep and Pink Floyd ad nausem (the whole scene was moving real fast and it disappeared way before you were ready for it to). Oh well, I stayed with BAD a little and the first two cd's are cool driving music. This collection is the Clash so if you want the Clash here it is, just packaged like crap.
