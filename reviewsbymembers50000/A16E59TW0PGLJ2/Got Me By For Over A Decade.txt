 This anthology is a great start for newbies to Elvis Costello. I had his early albums on vinyl and have been a fan since 1979, this was my "budget" collection for about 10 years (along with the very best of EC) till I decided to splurge on the individual cd's. A word of warning though, this only covers his early stuff that goes back 20 years plus. Elvis is a prolific musician and has put out a lot of great material since, so my advice is to buy the original cd's that were released used on Amazon (some you can get for under 5.00 with shipping), it will run you 100.00-150.00 for about 15 cd's but you'll have 400 really good songs to listen to so it's worth it. Or get this used and if you really get into it pass it on to a freind (or resell it) and do plan B. Enjoy!
