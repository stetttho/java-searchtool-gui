 I bought this cd when it first came out, and it seems I'm the only one who did! I actually listened to the crap out of this disc because I was looking for anything new with the English Beat/General Public sound. I can listen to this disc straight through with a lot of pleasure. Your Problems, I Told You, Smashing Down Another Door, One Minute Closer are all cool tracks, with In Love With You the pop track on the disc thats sounding good also. Good for Beat/General Public fans!
