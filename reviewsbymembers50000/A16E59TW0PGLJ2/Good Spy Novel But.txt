 I did enjoy reading TTSS because of all the intricate details and I'm sure it was breaking new ground when written exposing the extreme paranoia that spies face. However, it seems so obvious to me now but never occurred to me until this "leak" in the CIA got busted, why didn't they use lie detector tests in the agency? No mention of that option is revealed in the book. Also I guess I was expecting something more of an exciting ending, the realistic nature of the story telling (albeit no lie detector tests in this spy world), led to a mundane ending. A thinking mans spy novel until you start to think too much about it.
