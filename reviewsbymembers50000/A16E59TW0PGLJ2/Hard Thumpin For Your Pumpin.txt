 The year 1995, I'm in the middle of hard times with my love life. A time of changes for me ending one relationship and entering another. In comes Whitesnakes Greatest Hits. Yes it took me that long to listen to this cd, through finding it at my work, abandoned. A hard rock guy in the late 70's (Led Zep to death, Queen, Cream, Kiss), I got into punk/new wave/ska in the early 80's and missed the whole heavy metal thing, so I havn't a clue who's cool or lame, I just like what I like. 1995, I'm listening to this cd with its power ballads playin REAL loud, driving in the rain and in comes "Cryin In The Rain", it's something that really called it; I guess like people who listen to Sinatra sing songs about the blues, it was real. Short time later, playing the hard thumpin "Still Of The Night", "Slide It In" and escpecially "Looking For Love" having passionate times with my new woman (who would become my new wife later), yes Whitesnake will never be forgotten by either of us, AWESOME MUSIC!
