 Wow, is this a great American idea or what? Wish I had thought about such an obvious story to put in a children's book to counter books about socialist fish and gay prince weddings (and I Have Two Mommy's, oh my!). Of course the Left, who just love to put forth "art" exhibits of the President with a gun to his head and the title of "a true patriot act", and the Virgin Mary in feces, on the argument that it's free speech will ask that a book like this be censured. The scary thing is that if they were in power in enough places they would censure books, and no one would be the wiser. Congrats to the author, I cracked up when I heard the premise. My kids are past the age of this book but I've made sure they've heard about the lessons of honest work and why the government sucks when it comes to getting ahead in life, ie New Orleans and just about every inner city in America (unless you're in Washington of course).
