 Man was I missing out for 22 years. EC put out so many albums in this time frame and I had a lot of things going in my life (being a sailor and away from the US, plus getting into all the other music at the time), that this release slipped through the cracks for me. My listening experience for the time till now was the selected tracks from the compilations I had bought (Girls...The Best....The Very Best), so for all this time I'm getting Pills and Soap, Shipbuilding, and Everyday I Write the Book as representation here. Now that I'm getting the real EC releases and listening to all these tunes I'm floored. Yeah it's a EC pop release and I'm saying to myself "All Right!" I'm a big Get Happy lover as well as Imperial Bedroom (the later another of those I settled on selected samplings from the compilations) so I absolutely am digging this cd now. Will it hold up for me for another 20 years? I happen to think it will. Songs I can't keep playing over and over right now because the vocals are awesome; "The Element Within Her", "Charm School", "Love Went Mad", and "The Invisible Man". I love the line in "Element" that goes like this "But back in the bedroom, With her electric heater, I SAY 'ARE YOU COLD?', SHE SAYS 'NO, BUT YOU ARE', La La La " I cracked up over that one, right up there with my favorite EC lyric "They call her Natasha when she looks like Elsie". If your looking for a deal get the Rykodisc release for about half (the bonus stuff is mostly unpolished demo's that I won't listen to regularly) but definitely get this CD it's a very worthwhile disc for EC fans.
