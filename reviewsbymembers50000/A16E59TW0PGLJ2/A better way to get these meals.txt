 Hey, I know a way you can get these practically free of charge, yeah you guessed it, join the service! But really MRE's may have come a long way from the civil war days of hard tack but they still have a long way to go before I'd actually WANT to eat them over a conventionally cooked meal. I guess it's good for emergencies though, or to act like a soldier on a camping trip.
