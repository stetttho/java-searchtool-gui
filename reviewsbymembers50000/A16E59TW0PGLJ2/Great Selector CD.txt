 I saw the Selector in 1980, I was right at the stage in NY around 45th St (coulda touched Pauline Black!), I was 16 and new to the whole scene (who was'nt?). The Selector put on an awesome show! So I've been kinda thinking of this short lived group recently, having played to death The English Beat, The Specials, Madness, and others over the past 20 years. This CD for the price, I got mine new at Amazon.com, was a great buy!
