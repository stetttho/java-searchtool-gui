 I just read Anton's review about waiting till this is released again on HDTV. You know what, I don't care. I used to sell high end home stereo's and big screens and when I first started in 1987 I had people say they would not buy a big screen because they were waiting for HD, true story! I know we are a lot closer to that now but this is the thing, I can pick this entire series NOW for a few dollars an episode. I remember seeing people with this series on tape and I know those were like 30.00 a pop, this is roughly 1/10 the cost, how much cheaper does one wait till you say I'm buying? I also see that this is being shown on G4 "uncut" well thats cool but c'mon DVD blows away cable TV. The biggest reason I'm getting this now is I just took my kids (age 13 and 16) to Vegas and we went to the Star Trek Experience (which was very very bad), but it made a big impression on my kids! We now have something in common because I bought a deck of Star Trek TOS cards and while playing cards with them they were actually showing a lot of interest in watching this show! Having grown up watching ST TOS in syndication in the 70's and actually going to one of the first Star Trek conventions in New York, I love this show. Has it influenced me and my morals? Absolutely! I'm going to enjoy letting my kids explore this series on their own and being influenced as I was by the great stories this series produced. And as far as the HDTV version coming out; well I'll just sell this set on Amazon, duh!
