 I loved and still love most of these shows, so to get their themes on CD for under $10.00 seemed like a no-brainer. I must say though that are not by the original artists and listening to them gives me the feeling I'm listining to one of those K-Tel records from the 70's where they advertised all the latest pop hits on a record and when you got it, it was done by some lame band, not the original. While the bands here are pretty close to the original it just doesn't quite sound the same. Still it's a small investment so take a chance.
