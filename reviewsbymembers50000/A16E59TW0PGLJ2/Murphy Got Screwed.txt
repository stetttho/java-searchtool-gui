 A real favorite movie of mine, I'm really happy to see Murphy's War on DVD. ++++Spoilers++++ It is a shame for Murphy the way the end goes, and it will totally blow you away kinda like the jolt of watching the Bedford Incident ending had for me. But really, Murphy got a raw deal because those Nazi's deserved to die after all the atrocities they had done. Ok Ok they were following orders just kill the Captain I guess. Great moments of Murphy flying a seaplane and not knowing how to fly, the dropping the bombs dead on with wick fuses is really far fetched but for some reason I totally was into it and never questioned that till now. The only other thing I did notice right off was the modern sub used but thats totally understandable and its a pretty boat too. I know, I know,  war is a  bad thing, and I guess a heroic Murphy ending is very boreing so that wouldn't work. However don't forget England had Chamberlain who was the worlds darling for saving the world in 1939 or so and look what happened. Highly Recommended
