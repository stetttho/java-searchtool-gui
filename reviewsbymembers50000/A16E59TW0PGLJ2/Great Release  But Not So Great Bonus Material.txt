 I wanted to rate this a 4 star at first, I listen to the majority of the main discs songs often when I'm driving to work. However the bonus disc for this brings it down a star, the majority of these demo's are not polished enough to be listenable unless your a fanatic (which I probably am but still). The levels are not set right and even the live songs on this bonus are kinda weak. If really rough versions of EC's songs are what you like than you'll like it but these were way to rough for me. I give the original release 4 stars and the bonus disc 2 so the average is 3. Definetly worth it for the first disc for any EC fan but maybe the prior releases are a nice bargain, you won't be missing anything by not getting the bonus disc.
