 I am a huge EC fan, and I listened to this compilation for a long time (release date of 2001 seems wrong, I could have sworn I got this at an earlier date than that but no matter I definitely own this set). However, I updated my collection on Amazon and now own about 15 EC disc's and this compilation does not have much if anything from the 90's to today so you are missing out on some great songs! I would at one point in my life have said that EC's best was done during his first 7 releases (which are what this compilation mostly has on it), I have to say now that although they had more consistently great songs on them, the material he has done since has likewise great material on it. Thus with this release you are getting about 40% of what I consider EC's very best. I made an mp3 disc for my car from the cd's I now have and I had to delete songs to make it fit on a 700MB disc (at 128K), that came out to 218 songs. Hey if you are young and want some retro EC this is great. If you are looking for a one stop shop end all for EC, don't use this as your sole EC collection because you'll really be missing out on a lot of great (and newer!) songs!
