 Thankfully Amazon lets you sample this stuff online, because these covers are pretty lame. About the only one I enjoyed was the Vapors tune remake, the rest if I bought this disc I know I would never listen to. Much prefer the originals and the whole idea of a cover is to be different and I guess they are but not in a way that I want to listen to it. It's just like all the covers being rehashed on Pop 40 radio with No Doubt doing Talk Talk's "It's My Life" (at first I thought it was Madonna), and someone else did a Cure hit recently that charted well, it's like oh you poor people that don't know how good the ORIGINAL versions are! I asked an early 80's "Retro" DJ at a radio station to play "Smash it Up" by The Damned, he said "what the song done by The Offspring?". He lost all credibility after that point. Just get the original stuff and be much happier.
