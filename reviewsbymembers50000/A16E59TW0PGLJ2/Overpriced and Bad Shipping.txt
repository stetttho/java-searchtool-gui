 The magazine is ok, its on par with Miltary Heritage magazine in my opinion. It is in a hardcover binding so that justifies the increased pricing but I dont think its worth 9.00 an issue. I could buy a nice book for that amount, plus they shipped me if I remember correctly 3 of the 4 issues for the year in the first 3 months so it really seems like a ripoff to pay 35.00+ and not get it for much of the year.
