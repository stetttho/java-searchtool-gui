 I have come to the conclusion that people that post on Amazon are pretty much only those who love the group they are posting on. I mean every band I have been too from Beastie Boys to the Monkees to The Challengers are all 4 and 5 star reviews (not to mention really bad groups like Duran Duran and OLP)! So it's no surprise that OLP Clumsy gets all 5 stars also. But I'll tell you something, this cd caused me to stop buying music on a whim (or a hunch) based on one song, that song being Superman is Dead. When this cd was released in the states in the 90's, I woke up to get ready for work, fealing a little rough and put on the Canadian music channel because MTV stopped playing rock videos 15 years ago. They were playing OLP Superman is Dead and I'm like "oh wow that is very cool, and the little twirling toy robot in the video is awesome!". Go out and get the cd that day and its just horrible, tried to listen to it maybe twice and that was that. I stopped buying cd's that I knew nothing about after that. I mean I guess people are either from Canada that love this band or think Pearl Jam and STP are to old for them? I don't know but OLP Clumsy does ring a bell with me (was going through a friends music collection and saw he had a bunch of OLP, listened to it all briefly and I'll pass). It also just struck me that the lead singers twang he does is kinda like Jerry Lewis when he does that over accenuated twang he does, does anyone else pick that up? I'll give Clumsy 2 stars because Superman is Dead makes me think of the twirling toy robot in the video and now Jerry Lewis.
