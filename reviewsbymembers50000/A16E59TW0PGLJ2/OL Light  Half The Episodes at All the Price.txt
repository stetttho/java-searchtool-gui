 So call me a cheapskate but I did purchase the OL season 1 set, I just can't see why I would shell out my hard earned greenbacks to buy 1/2 the episodes of season one just to see 2 or 3 good episodes. I didn't grow up on this show (I'm a Star Trek TOS kid), but I did see it on reruns and I usually caught the crappy episodes (yes this series had quite a few of them, probably from season 2). All in all I think I'll rent this set and check out the few good episodes available. As far as the newer Showtime production, there's just something about remakes that doesn't get it for me. I watched a few but they just didn't entertain me as much.
