 This is a great movie for a war buff looking for a different twist, that being a heroic Italian war view. .... I saw it on tv a long time ago and the ending is awesome! The version I purchased was done in LP mode (jacket says HIGH Quality, LOL)and it was about 100 line resolution so little things like, say, peoples faces were a total blur, LOL. It was dubbed on the label Star Classics so definetly stay away from that version. Movie is worth going onto DVD escpecially considering some of the worthless garbage stuff they're putting out lately when it comes to vintage war flicks.
