 THX 1138 is one of my favorite films. I first saw this as a youth on the late show and loved the ending, not being able to fully comprehend the rest. Much later I saw this on the IFC along with the college short, and absolutely loved it. The newer reviews here have debated the updated issue of this DVD release, but I wanted to comment on the message I got from viewing this great film. This forum was populated with many who commented on how Lucas was showing what a warped capitalist society could evolve into. While I could understand why some would believe this (it does make a comment along the lines of buy things, be happy), I feel the film absolutely shows the consequences of a liberal/socialist society gone to its full fruition. Some of the reasons are if you look at the way the society is structured, it is run by a ruling class of Elite's. These Elite's are featured in THX's trail; if this was a right wing/capitalist society I doubt we would see the aggressive Feminist who demands for THX's death because he made love to a woman (possible young Hillary sighting?). Other examples I feel justify why it's a scary thought if the Progressives ever get absolute control of us; there is strict gun control (no one has any); you MUST take your mind altering drugs; abortion isn't just a choice it's a forced policy (communist China?); youths are taken under the total care of the state, eliminating the family model; the church is a branch of the government (no freedom of religion). Scary thoughts of a future society made scarier by the naive people today who comment that this is a reflection of a right wing/capitalist society.
