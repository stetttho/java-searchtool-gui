 I've owned 3 versions of this now going back to the original LP (long gone in a broken relationship, how ironic huh?), to the first cd and now this release. One thing I did do a double take  on was they took some of the original songs from the LP and put them on the bonus disc (thats wierd huh?), ie Girls Talk and maybe others, I cant find the original lp track listing and I don't know where that ex girlfriend is now from 20+ years ago to ask her to look for me, lol. I recently bought this and about 14 or so other EC discs (Amazon is great for me to buy music from) and have really started getting into all the bonus disc's after listening to his first 7 releases for over 20 years. Of course this was my personal fave from high school on, but I'm probably more into the vast collection he's done since and a lot of the 90's - early 00's stuff is really great for me so I'm leaning more into that as my favorites now. But for the memories and the great bonus disc on this release, it easily rates 5 stars. Must have for any EC fan and any alt rock fan in general, EC is kinda like a reference that is cool whoever you hang with.
