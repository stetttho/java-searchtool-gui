 Man o man, the video to Land Of Confusion I will never forget. The truth is I can't because half of my persona is stuck like that guy in Star Trek TOS in an alternate reality. You see Genesis video to Land Of Confusion was never made in my other half's world and since President Reagan didn't have any guidance from Phil and the gang, he ended up pushing the button and we all died from skynet terminator cyborgs (oh sorry that was another alternate reality), no really thanks to Phil and the profound video to Land Of Confusion nuclear WW3 toe to toe with the Rooskies (as Slim Pickens calls em) was avoided! Please believe me and thank you Genesis. Boy I wonder if Phil and the gang ever do a homer (doh!) at how pitifully stupid that whole no nukes movement of the 80's was looking back at the fall of the Berlin wall that wasn't even 5 years after this pop crap feed the dumbass masses brain wash food came out.  There was so much of this manipulative garbage out there on MTV too (that video seems to have been out along with Frankie Goes To Hollywoods "Two Tribes" mud pit Reagan video). What was really with Genesis anyway? They were awesome on "Genesis" and than they like spit on lots of things in fashion to spit on  with the left (Jesus He Loves Me with Phil the Evangilist, another video about a illegal immegrant), pleeease spare me. I have to admit though when they weren't bashing America those videos were great for their time with Phil doing the Road Warrior and stuff. The music from this era they made does'nt hold up at all today, very dated.
