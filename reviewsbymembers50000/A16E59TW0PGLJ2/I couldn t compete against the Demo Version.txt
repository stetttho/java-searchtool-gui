 I'm not the type who is really good at these games but I found it amusing that I couldn't really compete against the cpu even in the introductory battles (on hard because in easy the cpu doesn't use all the resources so it's a flawed game) of the demo version of Cossacks 2. I'll capture 75% of the towns and build lots of blockhouses and despite all that the cpu has nearly endless armies to attack with thus you are stuck in an attrition battle that lasts HOURS. Maybe this game is for a core group who are very experienced (which I'm not, thank God), but if you are a novice at RTS I would recommend starting with something else or downloading the demo first before you buy.
