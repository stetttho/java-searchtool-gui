 I like this magazine a lot. I also get Military history and World War 2 magazine and this is my favorite of the three. The best thing about military history magazines in general is getting a new issue in and learning about something you had no idea happened. An example would be England ruling Argentina and the Philippines, did you know that had happened? I sure didn't. Also you will read, like in this issue I have here, about a battle contingency England had to invade the Washington territory in 1861 at the start of the Civil War; it's stuff like this that keeps me very interested in reading this magazine more so than the World War 2 stuff that I've probably over read (although it's in here also). Great glossy paper and pictures also makes it stand out from my other subscriptions, highly recommended.
