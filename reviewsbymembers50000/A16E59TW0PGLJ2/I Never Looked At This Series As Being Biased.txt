 This is one of best war documentaries ever made (I place it tied or at least close to "The World At War"). I would seriously think of purchasing it because it's being shown in chopped up episodes full of commercials on TV now. Why do I think it's so good? It was made just 5 years after the end of the American involvement so all the major characters were still alive to be interviewed. The Vietnam War was the most filmed war ever to that time so the documentary is able to take advantage of all the film (mostly in color). Lastly, Richard Basehart's narrative voice is as distinguished as James Earl Jones. I never perceived a bias politically on the series, (I lean heavily to the right on foreign affairs), and I think although the war was a tactical loss, it helped win the cold war so it was a strategic win (the east could not provide the basic necessities of life while competing with the west's war machine output). Still, just reading now that Peter Arnett wrote this series makes me pause, but if any war deserved Peter Arnett's input I guess this one would. Maybe it's not being re-released because Arnett has "jumped the shark" and has been totally discredited as an objective journalist. It's a shame because there isn't anything on the Vietnam War that comes close to this series quality and historical reference. To all you American (and Allied) Vietnam Vets, God Bless You Brothers and Sisters, I salute you!
