 I'm just writing about the group not really about this cd. I remember quite well Fascist Groove Thang, and still listen to it on a compilation cd I have. Isn't it just so funny that as youths we could listen to this and not really hear the words, (i.e. "Reagan is President Elect, Fascists are advancing")? I play that song to my teenage kids now and show them the emptyness on most of the politcal left, and how they will use names like Cowboy (to Reagan and now Bush) and the ever popular "Fascist" when they've totally run out of real debate. Great stuff, my how little things have changed. I also remember the English Beat ("Stand Down Margret"), Phil Collins (had a video with a puppet Reagan pushing the button), Frankie Goes to Hollywood "Two Tribes", showing Reagan vs Breshnev or Gorbachav in a sand pit wrestling. Just really stupid things that in the long run made me wonder if there wasn't some manipulation going on with the record execs and the material they were/are (i.e Eminem) dictating what the masses should listen to. I know it's a business and all about the bottom line but still makes me wonder if something bashing the left would have 1: sold just as well (or as little cause Heaven 17 ain't no big success), and 2: been treated with the non eyebrow raising this stuff got (I see websites condeming nationalistic punk rock all over the place). I hope it makes you think.
