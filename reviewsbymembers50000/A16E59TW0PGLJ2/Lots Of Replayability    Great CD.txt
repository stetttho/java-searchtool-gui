 I'm outside the US for an extended time so I loaded all my cd's into my notebook. This one, Skandalous:I got You Covered is one of my favorites now! I picked it up a few years ago browsing through a cd bin and its been a while since I tuned to it but today when me notebook on random hit "Police Woman" I was like, oh man is that just awesome?! I've played to death my Specials, English Beat, Madness, Selector stuff and if your in the same boat wanting some different Ska check this disk out. For the low price it's selling for it's a great buy!
