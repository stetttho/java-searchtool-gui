 ... this was pretty good. I bought it so my girlfriend and i could watch it, because it was always something on our "to do" list. Well, i have to admit, it was entertaining. I'd never seen the play or heard about the story, so the content was very fresh to me. The musical score is, of course, very solid, and the extras on the DVD are also good to flip through. I like to know the historical background of stuff like this, so the extras did a very good job on those terms. If you haven't seen the nutcracker and want to be entertained, pick this up. It's cheap!
