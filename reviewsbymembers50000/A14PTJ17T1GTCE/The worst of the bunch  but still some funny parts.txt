 Okay, well- I'm adding this part to all my South Park Reviews: For this price for four episodes, this is a great deal. I remember buying the VHS versions first (which are split up differently), and feeling I got ripped off on those once I saw how great these DVDs were. (oh, and i forgot to mention this in my earlier reviews, but i guess better late than never: The commentary before each episode by Matt and Trey are priceless. Very funny stuff.) Okay, out of the six DVDs originally released this was the worst. Conjoined Fetus Lady is pretty good, but then the Mexican Staring Frog of Sri Lanka, Flashbacks and Summer ...... are all pretty bad.  But Flashbacks takes the cake- WOW IS THIS EPISODE TERRIBLE. Trey and Matt even admit in the beginning of the episode in their duologue that they came up with the episode when they ran out of ideas... and they REALLY ran out of ideas on this one.   If you don't want to pick up all the DVDs, pass on this particular one.
