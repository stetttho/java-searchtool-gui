 I haven't heard about the 3rd party memory cards, but from experience, those will inadvertantly erase your games. Yup, and I'm not kidding, either. Even though most of my cards are 3rd party, I own one of these for my "super important save games..." There's a huge chunk reserved for FFX, XI and XII... So, much like an insurance policy... get this and you won't ever have to worry.
