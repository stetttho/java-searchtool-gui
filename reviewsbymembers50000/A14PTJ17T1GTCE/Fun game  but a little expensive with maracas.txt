 The maracas are an absolute necessity too. And the worst part is, if you want it to be a party game, you need TWO sets of maracas. I haven't tried the third party sets, so I don't know how they are, but I'd certainly like to know, becuase the official ones run you about 60-80 dollars a set. Add the game to this, and you've got yourself the cost of two dreamcasts. Good things these maracas are going to be backward compatible with the new samba de amigo 2001 game coming out. If not, I'd be a little upset. As for the game itself, listen to all these other reviews- it's fun. it's addicting. It's tiring. Don't try playing when you have the flu, because you'll wanna throw up afterwards.
