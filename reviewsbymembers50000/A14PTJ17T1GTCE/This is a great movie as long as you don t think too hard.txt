 There are really two ways you can watch this movie. You can be very analytical and ask who, what, why, where and how, or you can just sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is - a movie. If you are over-analyzing the movie, you will undoubtedly hate it. Yes, there are many plot holes and flaws in the time sequence concept, but nonetheless, it's an enjoyable movie. It was giving me goosebumps throughout the first 30 minutes... it was great. Audio- very nicely done... I could actually hear the dialogue from the center channel without being drowned out by the sub, which seems to be a problem with some of my other dvds. The extras on the DVD are also well done. There's a "science behind frequency" featurette that's really interesting to watch. If you like the scientific side of things, you'll definitely want to check that part out.
