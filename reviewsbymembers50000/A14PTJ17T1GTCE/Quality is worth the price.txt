 This is a shout out to anyone buying cartridges for a printer that is worth something to them. If you want to prolong the life of your printer, I wouldn't risk getting the low-quality cartridges or refills that you can get on ebay. I only get the genuine cartridges for a reason- I know that when I'm printing photo quality prints on quality paper, I don't have to worry about anything going funky. You get when you pay for, and in this case, it's peace of mind.
