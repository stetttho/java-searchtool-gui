 If you're looking for a story that has true-life politics and accurate representations of parties, I guess The American President might not be for you. But c'mon, we're talking about a movie here, and an enjoyable one at that. Immerse yourself in the situation, and you will become involved with a touching and emotional film about a president who actually has high moral standards (yeah yeah... realism isn't the high point in this flick) and his lobbiest girlfriend who really DOES have no hidden motives (yeah yeah...). So just sit back and enjoy the film, because if you don't get offended by the apparently unrealistic politics, then it's fun to watch (even if you hate michael douglas and annette bening, who aren't my favorites by all means).
