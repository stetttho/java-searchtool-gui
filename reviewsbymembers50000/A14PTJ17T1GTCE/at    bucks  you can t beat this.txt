 I remember the first time I watched this film, I was sitting in a motel with my brother watching the international channel. For the entire movie, our jaws were on the floor, because what was on the screen was so absurdly bizarre that we didn't know what to think of it.  So we went out and bought the DVD... for 40 bucks, which was the price of this for the longest time. Good for everyone else that the price tag has dropped down to 17 bucks. This movie is downright hilarious, and is perhaps one of my favorite comedies. Despite the terrible subtitles (ie: fairy = angels), the content is great. Go out and pick it up today if you can.
