 The Killer has incredible action and a provocative storyline. You may say, "that's it?" but for those of you who have seen it, you know that those two elements are more than enough to make a good movie in the hands of John Woo.  In classic Woo-fashion, there's a lotta bullets, a lotta killing and a lotta slow-motion. The opening sequences are incredible, and for a flick made in 1989, way ahead of its time. The cantonese language track also adds to the movie, so please don't ruin it by listening to the english track. Reading is good for you... the translation is good.
