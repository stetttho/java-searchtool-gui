 I recall reading something someone had said about Jack Nicholson. He said that Nicholson was a terrible actor, because he is the way he is on screen in real life. This makes sense now, given all his roles are the same person. I suppose you just need to find a story that matches you so you get awards for being yourself. (?) Why this movie won so many awards is beyond me. The acting is mediocre, and the story was very annoying. I was in a very lovey-dovey mood when I watched this, but when I stopped... I was more angry than anything because the movie didn't end quick enough. This was supposed to be a romantic comedy. I'm not a huge fan of Helen Hunt, so I suppose that didn't help...  but the overriding thought throughout was, "please end. why won't this end?" I know... sad. Go get You've Got Mail if you want a good romantic comedy.
