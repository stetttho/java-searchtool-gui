 .. I can't deny that he has a great voice. Although I believe Henley has somewhat of a God complex, his music is very solid. His one single on Inside Job is good, but if you're buying this DVD to listen to his rendtion of Hotel California, please pass on this one. HOTEL CALIFORNIA AND BRASS DO NOT MIX. Yes. It's that bad. Desperado, as always, is a classic. if you want some great stuff by henley, you can't forget about the rest of the boys... go get When Hell Freezes Over.
