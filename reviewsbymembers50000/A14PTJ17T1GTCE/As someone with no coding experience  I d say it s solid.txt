 I've never taken a programming class, and I've never picked up a programming book before. I was checking out the Smiley books down at the B & M stores, but they seemed to be a little too fluffy for me. I like the idea of code you can look at and concepts presented to you in a logical manner, and this books seems to do a pretty good job of that. My only complaint is the example code sometimes uses stuff you don't learn until later on, which I find very confusing because I like to understand the entire page before i turn to the next one.  But once you run into the formally introduced code down the road, it makes a bit more sense. But on the VB scene as a whole, I'd have to say that the books are pretty easy to read, but starting from scratch is a much more daunting task. The only reason I'm learning is to debug, so I'm probably going to have to go out and get some VBA books and some reference materials (probably an o'reilly nutshell book).
