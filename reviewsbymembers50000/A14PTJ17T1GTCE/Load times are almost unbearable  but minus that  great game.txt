 The monkey island series are perhaps the greatest video game series ever, even pitting up against the likes of Final Fantasy, Zelda and all the other great ones. It's a shame not too many people have actually played the games. But perhaps this, now on a mainstream platform, will change things. For those familiar with the older games, there is no such thing as monkey lite on this thing. It's hard right from the get go. I feel sorta dumb after the fact, but the cannon puzzle really had me stumped. (I won't spoil it for you) :) But the main con to this game is the horrendously slow loadtimes and sometimes choppy animation. Whenever a monkey comes on screen, it's not smooth AT ALL. It's pretty embarrassing if you focus on that, but luckily, not a lot of action takes place int he game. It's more a thinker game. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.
