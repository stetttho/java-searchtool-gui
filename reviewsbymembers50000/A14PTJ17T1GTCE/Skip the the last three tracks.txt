 ... because that's all you need to hear. Absolutelyincredible. Aeris' Theme, The Overworld Theme and the most evilvillian music ever- One Winged Angel have all been arranged to a fullorchestra. The rest of the tracks are just mediocre in comparison,but the OST to VII was solid anyway, so they're good to hear. Butunfortunately, unlike the Final Fantasy VIII Arranged album (which isalso sold on amazon ... GET IT), 90% of these tracks are old and justrecycled off the original soundtrack. If you're a diehard fan and mustown everything, get it... those three songs are incredible. If youthink paying [this much] for three songs is too much, well- then passon this one.
