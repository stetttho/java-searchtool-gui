 ... you're in serious trouble. The book is filled with one liners and naughty phrases, but it's pretty useless in real world situations. I can guarantee a zero-percent success rate if you can't follow up any of these lines with conversational Japanese... if you can't, it looks like you read the line out of some book- which is bad. However, if you already know Japanese, this book is fun to flip through. I'd probably get it as a gag gift for someone who was visiting japan more than anything.
