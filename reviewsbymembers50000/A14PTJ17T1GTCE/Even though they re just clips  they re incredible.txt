 Most of these tracks are under a minute long, because all of these songs come from the FMVs (Full Motion Videos) in the game, and don't appear on the actual 4-disc soundtrack. Some of the most outstanding ones are ALL of Kuja's themes, the silent mix of Melodies of Life and what I like to call the "Zidane Running" theme, which is really more of a sped-up variation of Melodies of Life. All of the tracks are orchestrated, which is always a nice touch. (as a general rule, Nobuo Uematsu + Live Piano OR Orchestra = gooooood.) I really wish they'd release these in the states so I wouldn't have to pay the exhorbanant prices for imports, but I guess Square and Digicube don't think there's enough of a market for this type of stuff over here. But nonetheless, it's still worth it.
