 Although both Crystal and Ryan becomes a little overbearing at times, they're tolerable throughout the movie... The chemistry between them isn't the same as say... Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, but nonetheless, it's still good and passable on-screen. The story somewhat bothered me in the sense that the "romantic dialogue" between the two was predictable and cheesed up. But still, it's not supposed to be American Beauty or anything, so it doesn't get to me too much. If you want a good romantic comedy, try picking up "You've Got Mail," which is also written/directed by Nora Ephron. She also did Sleepless in Seattle in case you were wondering.
