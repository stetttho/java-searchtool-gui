 Okay, well- I'm adding this part to all my South Park Reviews: For this price for four episodes, this is a great deal. I remember buying the VHS versions first (which are split up differently), and feeling I got ripped off on those once I saw how great these DVDs were.  I'll review each individual episode the best I can remember now... (oh, and i forgot to mention this in my earlier reviews, but i guess better late than never: The commentary before each episode by Matt and Trey are priceless. Very funny stuff.) Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls: Ol' Robert Redford must not be too happy about this episode, but it certainly shows some people how commercialized things have gotten at those film festivals (which Matt and Trey probably know a bit about). I still can't believe this episode aired, because it really must have tested how far the censors would go. Chickenpox: The two alternate stories are a.) the kids are made by their parents to get chickenpox by hanging around each other and b.) the income disparity between Kyle and Kenny's dads. Roger Ebert should Lay off the fatty foods: The man running the Planet-arium is trying to brainwash the kids into volunteer work and Cartman is trying to get to be the Cheesy Poofs spokeskid. No, it's not much more exciting than what I just described, sorry. Clubhouses: This was a pretty funny episode dealing with rivalry amongst friends and divorce. Stan's parents split, and the show really takes a stance on peering into the child's viewpoint... albeit a skewed one.  It's funny though, and if you don't know what DVDA is on that girl's shirt... go get Orgasmo, the movie Matt and Trey made before Southpark.
