 When you just pick up the Sony manufactured ones, you can just feel the quality in the weight... there's supposed to be a lot of technology with the analog buttons (it detects how hard you press the buttons) and such in these controllers... but in all honesty, not a lot of games actually utilize this as of now (02/12/01). However, that's not to say you should go get the old dualshock controllers.  Metal Gear Solid 2, Sons of Liberty is supposed to take full advantage of the analog buttons and all of the other neat gizmos on the controller that no other game does. These controllers also last much longer than your average 3rd party controller. I've never had a Sony controller break or wear down on me, so trust me, your money will be well spent on these.
