 This is a great product. it's easy to setup, configure, and manage. But since this is the one-port version, don't forget to pick up a hub or switch, because if you don't, it makes this product pretty useless. My only gripe is the lack of suppose from Linksys. I wish they'd have a faq on commonly used apps like ICQ or YIM... it's a pain sometimes to not be able to read a step by step manual. But you DO learn that way. :)
