 If you've played the game start to finish and listen to this CD, it takes you to a place that only little kids are supposed to go to. It's so surreal... you associate the music with the game, and it's a great experience. Anyway, back to the review... Although Liberi Fatali, Eyes on Me and the Ending Theme can all be found on all of the other VIII soundtracks, the rest of the songs on this CD are absolutely incredible. If I were to own ONE CD out of the hundreds I own, this would be the clear choice. Be sure to check out the ending theme's progression of Uematsu's masterpieces: Eyes on Me, Liberi Fatali, Prologue, Prelude.  That's an incredible piece of music if I've ever heard it. I wish I could promote this CD more than I'm doing right now, because I seem to be at a loss for words when trying to describe it. Go get it.  You'll love it.
