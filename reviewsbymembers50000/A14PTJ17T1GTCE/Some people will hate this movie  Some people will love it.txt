 Not a whole lot of inbetweenies...  it's a great movie- I've actually been told I carry the likeness of the main character, but that aside- the movie carries a dark and humorous tone that not many movies are able to pull off.  Now that I think about it, even though murray didn't write it, it carries much of the wit he has in say... ghostbusters. Deadpan humor. You can't beat it. The criterion collection has a bunch of goodies that every fan will enjoy, but the best are the MTV movie awards clips.  Funny funny funny.
