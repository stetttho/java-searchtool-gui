 Actually, before i go into the review, let me comment on some of the previous reviews.  To "An Electronics Fan:" What Leslie is talking about is not the voice over IP delay. Read her review more carefully- it says that the person she is talking to can hear herself. That means Leslie's friend is talking, the sound is going to Leslie's earpiece, and then the sound coming out of Leslie's Earpiece is being picked up through her microphone. To "Leslie:" Mine doesn't have that problem. Perhaps you should contact Labtec, because it may be a problem with your unit. As for MY unit, I love it. Besides the fact that it makes me feel like one of those people in AT&T commercials, the mic picks up what you want to hear and filters out what you don't pretty well. I've actually used this mic for a quick recording session with me and my guitar, and I was pleasantly surprised with the results. So if you're interested in recording, this could possibly hold you over for quite some time. I also like the ability for the mic to rotate 360 degrees, allowing you to wear the headset any way you please (mic on left OR mic on right). It gives you a lot more flexibility if you're like me and don't have a lot of space to adjust your body around dangling cords and such. So if you're looking for an inexpensive microphone/headset, I wholeheartedly recommend the Labtec.
