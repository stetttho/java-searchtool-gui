 Okay, first of all, I may be slightly biased because I am a fan of Peanuts and have been for decades. However, I think that is appropriately balanced with the fact that I was a state ranked tennis player and have worked in the tennis industry for several years, making me a very harsh critic of any tennis game. So on with the review! Take away Snoopy, Linus, Charlie Brown and all the other familiar characters you are able to play with, and do you know what you have? You still have a very solid tennis video game. The gameplay is actually very fun, and regardless of the sentimental value one may hold for Snoopy and the gang, it's an addicting game. As a tennis player, it's very nice to see actual mechanics used in the game (ie: when you swing earlier, you will pull the ball toward the forehand side).  It's a pretty easy game once you get the hang of it (swing once you hear the ball bounce),however, the very hard mode is absolutely impossible (well... right now at least). I haven't tried the two-player link mode yet, so I don't know how that is. The single player mode consists of normal, squash (walls count, but it's no fun) and powerup mode, which has icons you can pick up (similar to Mario Tennis). Then there's championship mode, which allows you to unlock characters and stages after completing it with the different difficulties. The cons of the game - No doubles play. That's about it, really. I guess i could complain about the monotonous sound effects, but for a system that was made 12 years ago, I'm not complaining. But back to the Snoopy and Peanuts bit- they're absolutely adorable. For the first couple hours, you'll be more engrossed with the character movements and how cute they are than the actual game play. Kudos to Infogrames for not pumping out a commercialized piece of [junk]. I'm looking forward to their release of their Snoopy flight adventure game later in the year (for the PS2 I believe).
