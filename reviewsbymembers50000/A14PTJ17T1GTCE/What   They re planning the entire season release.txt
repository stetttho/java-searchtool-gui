 Well, that sort of irks me, but still, this dvd set is very funny. The best part to me, as an audiophile, is that the series has been remastered in dolby digital (although 5.0, not 5.1). My only complaint is the whole deleted scenes claim. I have NO idea which scenes were in the original and which ones were not. i wish they'd give you some sort of clue, whether it be an extra in the dvd or a pop up icon (like the rabbit in the matrix) to let you know.  If you like friends and you don't want to wait for the season releases, pick this up.  It's fun to watch.
