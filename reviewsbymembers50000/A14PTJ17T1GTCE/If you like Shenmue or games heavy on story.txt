 ... then Shadows of Destiny might be for you. It's held my attention far longer than Z.O.E. or the MGS2 demo, because it does have a very intriguing storyline.  It has 5 possible endings (actually 7, but i won't get into that) that reveal the big picture which is the true story. (Be sure to keep the saves to chapters 5 and 7, because those are where you ultimately make the decisions that determine what ending you get) I like time travel oriented storylines, so this was pretty gripping. I find it pretty cool to be able to see the effects of a change in the past. (think Back to the Future) But the complaints to the game I've read in the reviews so far are pretty valid- The game is too easy. Yes, that's true. Most games- you die, and then you lose. Shadows of Destiny is more, you're SUPPOSED to die, and then it's really easy to get the puzzle solved. And the puzzles aren't challenging at all. For instance, you get shot. It tells you, "Why don't you go get something hard like a plate?"  Yeah- hard puzzle... i know. ;) However, like I said earlier, the storyline is fun to watch and even better to decipher once you finish the game. It makes you think, and if you're into thinkers- pick this up.
