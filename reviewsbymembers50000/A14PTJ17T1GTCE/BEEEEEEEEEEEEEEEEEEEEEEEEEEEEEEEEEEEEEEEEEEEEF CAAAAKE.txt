 Okay, well- I'm adding this part to all my South Park Reviews: For this price for four episodes, this is a great deal. I remember buying the VHS versions first (which are split up differently), and feeling I got ripped off on those once I saw how great these DVDs were.  I'll review each individual episode the best I can remember now... Cartman Gets an Anal Probe: This apparently took Matt and Trey a couple of months to do because they were still using construction paper cutouts. You could totally tell the animation style shift a little between this pilot episode and the rest of them. But as for the story, it's a classic. Anything story that revolves around Cartman I find pretty funny, and this is no exception. Volcano: Not my favorite episode, but still- it's funny to see Matt and Trey try to make fun of some social concern like hunting for sport. Anyway, cameo by Patrick Duffy. heh heh. Weight Gain 4000: One of the most hilarious episodes of all time. Cartman trys to get all big and buff with this stuff called Weight Gain 4000. It's funny to see Cartman interact with other people and with the TV. Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride: This episode had some incredibly funny moments in it and also introduced a character that many people seem to love- Big Gay Al. He shows up in the Movie too, so if you haven't seen this episode, you really should to get some background info on him.
