 I've come to realize that most people that see an adaptation of a novel on the screen hate it not because one is better than the other (regardless- this may be the case), but because the book enjoyed FIRST.  Yes, it's all about being FIRST.  This movie is second in most people's lives.. except mine. I watched this movie first, loved it, and then went out to the library to read the actual novel. I must say, the movie is better. I felt there was more of a balance between the two storylines (no spoilers, sorry), and that the soundtrack and cinematography added so much to the story. It's a beautiful piece of film, and I truly do recommend it. I didn't know what to expect from this movie, but what I pulled out of it was some serious-good-stuff. (Speaking of the soundtrack, the best song on it is by Mono.. and I think the song is called Mono. It's a great song, and is played throughout.) At first I thought it might be a little too slow for my tastes, but the pace was perfect for the story, so I didn't mind at all. Check it out if you can.
