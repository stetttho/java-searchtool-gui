 I listened to all the hype about his game creating an entirely new genre of videogames, but when I played it, I realized that there wasn't much new to this versus any other RPG. It's just more time dependant, which is more annoying than anything (i heard in Shenmue 2, you'd be able to fast forward to a specific period of time). but as a game, it's okay. That's why it got three stars. Unfortunately, the game was cut short due to time constraints, and the story ends very very abruptly at the end- it continues at the beginning of Shenmue 2, but it's obvious that where the game ended in Shenmue wasn't where it was supposed to end. Oh, and this game isn't for everyone. If you don't have a lot of patience, skip this one.
