 First off, the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can get the same song on the orchestral version or the full Final Fantasy VIII soundtrack (...). Of course, on both of those, you don't get the instrumental version, which I don't care for too much in the first place, because.... ... Faye Wong's voice is incredible. I've heard her sing in Chinese, talk in Japanese and now sing in English, and I must say- i'm very impressed. Eyes on Me is absolutely "accentless" and is a great addition to the game itself. Credits to Nobuo Uematsu for writing such a great piece of music. So, anyway- you'll get more for your money if you buy the Orchestrated Soundtrack to Final Fantasy VIII or the entire Final Fantasy VIII soundtrack.
