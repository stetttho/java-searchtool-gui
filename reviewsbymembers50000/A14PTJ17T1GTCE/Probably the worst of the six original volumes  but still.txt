 ... very funny. Okay, well- I'm adding this part to all my South Park Reviews: For this price for four episodes, this is a great deal. I remember buying the VHS versions first (which are split up differently), and feeling I got ripped off on those once I saw how great these DVDs were.  I'll review each individual episode the best I can remember now... An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig: I can't remember if this episode was supposed to coincide with the genetic cloning hoo hah that was going around the world at the time (Trey and Matt seem to like to do that...), but it introduces one of my favorite characters in south park - Mephesto, the evil geneticist. He pops in later for for the Cartman's Mom episodes, but he's still funny in this one. The kids are trying to come up with an unbeatable science project, so they decide they'll try to clone an elephant with a pig by making them fall for each other. Death: Stan's uncle makes me laugh. He wants to die. He wants to die really really bad, but he just can't die. Of course, this episode has, as you'd imagine, a lot about Kenny and his role with Death. Pinkeye: The first season's halloween episode, I believe. I always try to watch the holiday episodes around the coinciding season, but this one never seems to get me in the mood. Bleah. NOT my favorite episode... the town is zombified, even though everyone thinks they just have pinkeye. Damien: I sorta like the character Damien, regardless of his role with Hell. His father comes up to fight Jesus, which the last time I checked, is pretty blasphemus, especially given the events that occur in the episode. But hey, it's a comedy. Laugh a little. Oh, and speaking of- the Devil makes his first appearance, so if you've seen the movie, you might want to check this episode out for a little background information.
