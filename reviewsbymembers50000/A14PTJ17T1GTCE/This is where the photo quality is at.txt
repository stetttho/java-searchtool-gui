 Epson should really come up with an Ad Campaign that says, "Paper matters." Because if you've ever owned an Epson with photo-realistic capabilities and tried this paper, you'd know what I mean. This stuff is incredible. It's honestly almost impossible to distinguish between prints made on this paper and the photo glossy paper and actual photographs. Incredible. I've experienced no fading problems so far, and I treat my photos like any user would (ie: throw them on the desk and sorta forget about them until I clean).
