 Wow, you can hook up to the school networks! Wow, you can download stuff whereever you are! Well, guess what... all of these great ideas that pop in your head of what you can do with this card... toss them out the window. The product is so inpractical, that I can honestly say that I've only used it ONCE. Not only do you need to carry around a cat 5 cable around whereever you go, but you also have to lug around that tether thing that's attached to the card. Ugh.  It turned my sleek and sexy jornada into a clunker. I can't actually think of a real-world situation where I would use my jornada instead of a real computer that I had at my disposal (i'm assuming that where there is an ethernet port there are also computers available). Just maybe, if this were priced around 20-30 bucks, i'd get it, but that probably isn't going to happen anytime in the near future. As an ending note, I usually never write negative reviews, but this is one of those that I had to write because I didn't want people to get suckered in like I did.
