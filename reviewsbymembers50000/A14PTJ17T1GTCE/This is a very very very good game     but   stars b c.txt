 ... in comparison with the other final fantasies, this is just below par. -The character development for this isn't as clean as say... VIII -The Eidolon/Summon feature is a little shaky. -The ending is a tad disappointing -The soundtrack is not Uematsu's best but... -it's still very very fun to play -the visuals are, as usual, stunning (FMVs... normal gameplay) -Although not Uematsu's best, the soundtrack gets better over time (go pick up the piano tracks after you're done- they're marvelous) -the story is good -the references to old final fantasies are fun IV and VIII still remain at the top of my list, but this installment in the series is still very very good. If you've got some time, pick this up.
