 Once you go optical, you'll NEVER go back to using those clunky and dirt magnetizing balls and rollers on traditional mice. This is one of those products that you have to experience to believe, because I held off a couple of months before I picked one of these optical mice up because I thought "c'mon, my mouse right now is so smooth!" Well, guess what? I was wrong.  The way this mouse tracks is absolutely incredible. This is microsoft's best product, hardware OR software. A side note, for some reason, the optical eye has difficulty with standard cheap-o desk paneling as a tracking surface. I usually tape a piece of paper on the desk as a mousepad.  I take notes on it too, but that might just be quirky.
