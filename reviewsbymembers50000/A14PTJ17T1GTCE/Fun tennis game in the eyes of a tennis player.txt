 I think this is another outstanding addition to the Mario franchise because of one thing - it's fun. Even though I've never figured out how to lob the ball over people at the net (one of the only cons), you can get into some serious rallies with players of all skill levels, and it's pretty fun to see who cracks first. The multiplayer mode, as noted by others, is incredibly fun. True doubles strategy is in action, and it's good to see that in any sports game. However, I personally seem to have a problem with the depth perception on some shots. Even after playing the game for quite a bit of time, there are times when I think, "wow, I'm really gonna crank this one..." and I end up whiffing the ball instead, leaving me clueless as to why. Playing the computer is also lots of fun, but it can be frustrating at times. Wendy and I spent a good 6 hrs trying to beat Princess Peach and Donkey Kong on "difficult," and we cheated by setting the set length to "win by 2." sigh.  So, bottom line- regardless of whether you play tennis or not, it's an incredibly fun game. As a tennis player, you won't get annoyed at any of the fun stuff thrown in (I equate the extras in Mario Tennis to those in NBA Jam and the sport of basketball). It's fun and addicting, and I highly recommend it.
