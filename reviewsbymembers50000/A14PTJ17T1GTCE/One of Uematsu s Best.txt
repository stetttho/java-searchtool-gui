 The first time I heard the soundtrack, I hadn't played FFVIII yet (because it was released in the states much later than in Japan), and I didn't really care for it too much. But once you play the game itself and can really associate the tunes with emotions, places and characters, the music means so much much more. Some of my favorites on the CD are Liberi Fatali (if you ever finish the entire game, try translating the lyrics- they're in latin. It's really cool), Blue Fields, Julia, Breezy, Fragments of Memories, Fisherman's Horizon, Maybe I'm a Lion, and of course... Eyes on Me. The ending theme is also pretty incredible, because it incorporates Eyes on Me, a orchestral remix of Liberi Fatali, the prelude AND the prologue.  Uematsu didn't miss a beat on this one.
