 I'm not a big fan of the writing in this book, but I am, however, a huge fan of Steve Jobs. My girlfriend bought me this book as a gift, and I honestly couldn't put it down (finished it in a day). But here's the scoop: -This book has very little flow. It's very abrupt and jumps around a little too much for my liking. -I thought for a book about Steve Jobs, there was a little too much detail given about the beginnings of the guys at Pixar. There are probably dozens of consecutive pages with no mention of Jobs. That's not cool. -Some of the stuff that i figured would be referenced later in the book were never, so my "huhs?" when i first saw them were proven correct. Like I said- strange flow. Bits and pieces of things were thrown in for no reason. So why give the book four stars? Well, in all honesty, the reason I couldn't put it down was because of the information the book provided rather than the layout. If it was 300 pages of bulletpointed facts about Steve Jobs, I'd probably enjoy it just as much. It's a short read (the type is huge), but it's really entertaining. If you liked Pirates of Silicon Valley, you'll enjoy this book.
