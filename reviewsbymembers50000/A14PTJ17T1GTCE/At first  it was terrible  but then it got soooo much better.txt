 This was the very first game I purchased for the PS2. It was out of a lack of better options at the store, so I just decided on a whim to pick it up.  When I first put it in the PS2, I was sorely disappointed at the repetitious gameplay and graphics that obviously didn't utilize the power of the PS2.  However, after playing it for a while, I soon realized how incredibly fun and addicting it truely was. The strategy involved was just so engrossing, that I couldn't help but love the game. In addition, the historical background they give you on all the characters and battles I found to be really interesting (although I can see some just hating that sort of stuff). It's a unique pace of gameplay, and I think that if more people would give it a chance, it could be massively successful. Oh, and btw- It's not an easy game either. As in all strategy games, be prepared to lose a couple of times before you understand what to do.  Although it isn't the best PS2 out there, it certainly is an entertaining one.
