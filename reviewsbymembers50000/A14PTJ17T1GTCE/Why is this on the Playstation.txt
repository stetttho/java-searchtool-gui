 Is this game fun? Yes.  It is fun. But it is not 2001 fun. It is 1995 fun. Does this game belong on this platform? No. This is an embarassment for Sony to touting these incredible hardware specs and then have a game like this released on this platform. But that's what happens when third party developers start trying too hard to push games out the door. I'm waiting for metal gear solid 2. You should too.
