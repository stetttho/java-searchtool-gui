 The story is very abrupt.. it didn't flow quite as well as I thought it should have, but it didn't detract too much from the game. It's a very innovative battle system, and it's very fun to fight without random battles. The best part of the game, hands down though, is the soundtrack. It's incredibly captivating and really gets you into the realm of fantasy. Play the game, go buy the soundtrack... you'll think the game was a lot better afterwards. :)
