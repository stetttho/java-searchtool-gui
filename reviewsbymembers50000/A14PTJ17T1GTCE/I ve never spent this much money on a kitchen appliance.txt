 ... but i must say, I'm never buying a 30 dollar blender ever again. This thing is incredible. It does everything, and it cleans pretty easily too. I haven't had a problem with crushing ice as some others seem to have, but I don't do it that often. My only complaint is that the chrome model really isn't that chrome at all. You'd think for the extra dough you'd get something that's really chrome... but this blender is just PAINTED chrome. Yessirree. It's plastic.
