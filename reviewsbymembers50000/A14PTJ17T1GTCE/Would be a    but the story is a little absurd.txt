 ... but before I get to the story, let me tell you about the great things about this game. This music is incredible. An audio CD is included with the purchase of this game, so that's an added bonus, but there's also Grandia II Deus and Grandia II Povo... if you can find these anywhere, they're also nice to have (and don't have any of the techno beats that were maliciously added to the CD they give you). And for those of you that were wondering like me, the lyrics are all in Portugese.  Very nice... The gameplay is also very very solid. The battle system is innovative and best of all, fun to play... The artificial intelligence (autopilot for battles) is great for building experience, and the flow of the battles is also great. The bad part of these are the spells. They're long- drawn out, and annoying. The best spell to watch are the ones involving the shards of ice coming out of the ground, becuase it doesn't look like a movie pasted in. All the other spells are just terrible terrible terrible. The voice acting is as follows: Within the game.. VERY good.  Within the battles: embarrasing.  You'll see what I mean.  but I'm glad they decided to go with professionals on this one. It adds to their personalities. So.. back to the story. You will undoubtedly, throughout the game, stop and say to yourself, "huh? that doesn't make any sense." But take it for what it is... an rpg that isn't made by the storytellers @ square. Have fun!
