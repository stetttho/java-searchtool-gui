 But don't pick this up unless you've played the game all the way through. You wouldn't appreciate the tracks or the emotional impact that comes along with associating a piece of music with a part of the game.  It's a great experience if you have the time. In comparison with Nobuo Uematsu's other works, this is good, but it is by far from the best. If you want incredible music, go buy the OST to FF VIII, VII or Chrono Cross. The main theme, Melodies of Life, is constantly pummelled into you in many of the tracks from IX, and the problem is that Melodies of Life isn't very good in the first place. Four CDs, most of which you'll graze through... but still, all die-hard fans should have the soundtracks of the games you play. And if you like this OST, you absolutely MUST get the Piano Tracks for IX and the Plus edition (which contains all the cut scene tracks from IX).
