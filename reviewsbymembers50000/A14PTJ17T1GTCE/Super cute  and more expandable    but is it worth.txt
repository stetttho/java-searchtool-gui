 This is a great system. It has hundreds and hundreds of titles. It's supported by all the leading 3rd party manufacturers. It's adorable... ... but ...  It's .... This isn't too bad of a price tag when you think about it, but when you realize it's a.) old technology and b.) the same price as the dreamcast, it's a tough purchase to make. A year ago, this would have been 5 stars, easy. But since it's being phased out, I have to only give it 3. In addition, the PS2 is backwards compatible, meaning it actually has the ability to play games that were made for the PSOne. But on the plus side, this thing is incredibly cute. The picture that's shown with the controller... that's not depth perception trick, the thing is really only a little longer than the standard dualshock controller. How practical the expandability of it will be is another question... in Japan, the screen attachment will be coming out this spring, and there are already numerous wireless cell phone add-ons planned. But will any of these cool accessories come to the states? Probably not. The market for people buying a 4 inch lcd screen attachment is so small (given the price is likely to be through the roof), that SCEA will probably hold off it's American release.
