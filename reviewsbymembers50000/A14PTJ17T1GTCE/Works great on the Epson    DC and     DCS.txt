 I'm not sure how well this would work on other printers, but for the Epson Stylus Photo 875DC and 875DCS, it's great. These printers actually come with a roll attachment that allows you to slide on this banner roll and print. Plus, the drivers actually allow you to specify that you're printing off this roll and on this type of paper. It's great, easy as pie, and HIGHLY recommended. The print quality on this Glossy photo paper is also incredible. I've experienced no fading problems so far, and I treat my photos like any user would (ie: throw them on the desk and sorta forget about them until I clean).
