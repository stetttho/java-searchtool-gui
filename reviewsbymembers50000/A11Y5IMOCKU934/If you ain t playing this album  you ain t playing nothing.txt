 This album blew me away. I love every last cut on here including,"It Ain't Love". For years I pondered the idea of getting into the  recording business, because of the lack of grooves that aren't being  touched by alot of artist. And somehow, I feel like Rahsaan has been  eavesdropping in on my brain and using these grooves and vibes that only I  can visualize. And "It Ain't Love","So Right" and  "Any Other Love" are perfect example of brain vibing. This album  is a masterpiece and anyone with a good ear for soul music must pick it up.  "It's Alright Now" should be reason enough. Peace.
