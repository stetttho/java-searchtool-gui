 The critic that wrote that review above, needs to go back under the rock  he crawled from. This album was the funkiest and grittiest sound to ever  come from EWF. Before the funk was polished and pop radio ready. I prefer  the sound they were giving here more than the sound they're giving on later  albums. I'm talking pure black mystic here y'all. If you love stax and the  old early 70's ( 72-73) of soul you'll love this album. Don't miss out.  Forget what the critics say, they don't know jack.
