 I love this album. I remember getting it when I was a kid. I was all so taken by "Yearning For Your Love". Especially, when they performed it on Soul Train. That song is still one of the funkiest slow  jams ever. And the whole album you could just listen to all the way through  and never feel like you want to pick up the needle and put it on another  track. Some of my favorites are : Sweet Caroline, The Way, When I Look In  Your Eyes,Humpin' and of course the big hit. But Nothing Comes To Sleepers  But A Dream is one of the most emotional tracks on the album. This was GAP  at their best.
