 Got my package today in the mail. Opened it and was blown away. Any man  who can flip a Beatles classic like "While My Guitar Gently  Weeps" and the Donny Hathaway classic, " I Love You More Than  You'll Ever Know " gets much praise from me. I can feel every emotion  he puts into the songs on this cd. You truly get your pennies worth with  this release. If you have the first cd. and loved it, your in for a big  surprise. Go get it and support smooth soul music.
