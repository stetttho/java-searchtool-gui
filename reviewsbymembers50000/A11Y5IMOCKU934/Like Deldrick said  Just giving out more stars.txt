 I'm here to just ask,"Why haven't you (the buyer)guys picked up this cd yet?" If Me and Deldrick have posted more stars for this album, you know it's the bomb. I,too, am still bumping this album. I've had it since  this past summer,and it's still a treat. "What's Wrong With You"  is my ultimate jam. "The Meeting" is seductive and so very nice  ("Toniiiigggghhhhttt", those who don't have the album will  ask,"what is he talking about"). This is just a well rounded  album that needs to be heard. So take it from me and Deldrick, go get this  album. NOW !  or you'll be sorry(then you'll be asking me for a dub of  it).
