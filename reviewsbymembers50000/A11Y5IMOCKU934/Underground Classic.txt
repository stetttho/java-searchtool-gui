 The most underrated Funk and Roll album no one ever heard. This cd made me turn off my radio for good ( Repeated hits don't get my juices flowing). Dinner With Delores, Title track, I Will( featuring bakground vocals by Rosie Gaines) were killer tracks that were slept on by the radio. Get this one before it's out of print.  Peace Xes Cainam
