 Man, I really think that radio is gonna have to fine tune itself when they get a hold of this album. To say this is the album of the year is saying too little. This is the blackest album ever!  From the wicked beginning  track(Playa,Playa),to the astounding closing track(Africa)you know that  D'Angelo is not messing around. I mean just take a listen to "The  Root" and you can hear the paranoia of a brother who is cursed by  lover's past. The lyrics to this track just blow me away(Like the rain to  the dirt,from the vine to the wine,from the alpha of creation,till the end  of all time). Whoa, heavy baby. I won't even get into the vocal  arrangements on this track. I'm totally speechless. "Chicken  Grease" is some 'ol slippery funk that will definitely get you out of  your seat("I Know You Love Me Cause I'm Funky Cause I")I love  it!  And I can't forget "Spanish Joint". Salsa meets soul at  it's best. And the guitar and bass playing of Charlie Hunter is  like......AAAHHH. To top it all off he delivers one of the smoothest slow  jams thus far,"Send It On". This track is truly heartfelt and  once again those vocal arrangements come into play. Man; I'm through  talking about this album, if I haven't convinced you to buy this album than  your truly not ready to go to the next level of creation. I want to thank  D'Angelo personally for not backing down in what he believed in and seeing  his vision for this album all the way through to completion. Thank you,  thank you. P.S. "Greatdayndamornin'" is hot to death !
