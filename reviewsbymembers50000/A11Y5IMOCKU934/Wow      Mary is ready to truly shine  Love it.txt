 From track one ( All That I Can Say ) to track 14 (Let No Man Put Asunder), I was truly blowned away. Mary has stolen my heart once again. I'm so glad to see Mary growing along with myself and I can't wait till the  sequel Mary Part II. Killer tracks : Deep Inside, Beautiful Ones,Time,  Memories, Your Child, The Love I Never Had, and Let No Man Put  Asunder(which I feel was a major step and standout track on this album ).  She will go all the way over the top with this one. And for those who say  she lost it, well let's just say she lost you and found her true fans who  wanted to go on a uplifting ride. Ready, set, go !!!
