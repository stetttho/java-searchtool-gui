 Boy, I was excited to get my package in the mail from Amazon.com on Oct. 20th. And when I heard his version of the Beatles classic, "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" I thought this man could do no wrong. Make  Believe and Tomorrow were all so smooooooooth. This whole cd. is a winner  and I recommend it to all who are looking for that tenderness in their soul  music. Kenny's got it, so you go get it. Peace.
