 Sometimes I can just feel when something is gonna be big. And the first time I heard Til The Cops Come Knockin' I knew Maxwell was not gonna disappoint. I'm gonna leave you with this note, listen to the track Lonely's The Only Company and Reunion and you'll definitely see what I'm talking about. Get this one and get the sequel Embrya and play them back to back. Peace Xes Cainam
