 You know I see all kinds of kudos giving to David Bowie, and his boring portrayal of Andy Warhol(if you want to see someone pull off Andy Warhol,check out the movie,"I Shot Andy Warhol. The guy who portrays him(Andy in that movie, did a better job). Anywho,I love this movie, for the fact that you don't really get to see too many black artists'lives portrayed on film. And like I stated in the heading of my review,I hope this movie is being seen by young inspiring artist of color(you,too can start off being a graffiti artist, and turn that into something good). The other reason I like this movie, was Michael Wincott. Who I think pulled off the lead role very well. Why this movie isn't on dvd, I'll never understand. Anyway,purchase this movie. You'll love it.
