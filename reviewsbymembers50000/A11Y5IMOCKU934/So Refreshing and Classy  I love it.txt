 I was nervous about this project. Cause I wasn't to happy with New Power  Soul( though I grew to love New Power Soul after a couple more listens.)But  when I got my copy today in the mail from Amazon.com I was blown away. The  combination of Chaka and Prince( yes, I said Prince!!!) was really breath  taking. Cause I know nothing on the radio will sound like the tracks on  this cd. I guess that what happens when your not shackled down to a major  record company. ( Are you listening Warner Bros. ?) I not gonna pick a  favorite cut, I'll leave that to radio and critics. But, Chaka fans your  gonna love this one. It's almost like she sounds reborned or revitilized  exciting even. Not taking nothing from her Warner years, but these tracks  are more fun and classy. To me anyway. Well, what are you waiting for. Go  get a copy !!!
