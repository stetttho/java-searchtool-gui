 The complete fantasy scape of a lifetime. When I heard this album for the first time I had no doubt that Prince would stand the test of time. We all know about Raspberry Beret and Pop Life, but Tamborine,The Title Track and Paisley Park are just killer tracks. Raw and untamed. Funky and Psychadelic. This album got me through some rough times in Junior High. That why I put it up there with Sign O The Times as classic Prince at his wildest and sexiest. Good performances all around on this one. Check it out!!! Peace  Xes Cainam
