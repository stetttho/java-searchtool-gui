 What can I say about this album.........hot, hot, HOT !  From the beginning track Lucy Pearl's Way(which is best described as a midtempo remix of "If You Ask Me To". The solo song Raphiel Saadiq had  recorded for the Higher Learning Soundtrack. The way it's done for this  album,is just funky.)to the last track which features a marching band  performing their current hit,"Dance Tonight" you know you've just  experience something that you haven't really experienced before. This album  won't steer you wrong at all. My favorites have to be "Trippin'(very  funky track), LA La(which had me smiling from ear to ear), Everyday, and  the ultimate showstopper "Good Love",Don't Mess With My  Man,Remember The Time, Without You. Man, take my word for it, this whole  album is a pure delight. Just pick any track, you can't go wrong. Please  don't pass this album up. Buy it now !  What are you waiting for?
