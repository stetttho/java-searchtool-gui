 Oh man, Eric you did it again !!! I'm loving this cd a whole lot ( except Something Real, he could've left that one off ). But Poetry Girl is hot !!!! This song could've/should've taken the place of Something Real (  Warner Bros. what's wrong with y'all ? ). Love Of My Own is screaming quiet  storm format ( radio land are you listening ?). Why You Follow Me has that  latin feel to it and is pumping ( good job Ali Shaheed Muhammed, nice  collaboration with Eric )man but the song I have to really be feeling is  Lamentation. That song is very deep. I dug every minute of it. It's really  hard to choose what song might follow up Georgy Porgy, but if I had to pick  I would choose Loving Your Best Friend ( the breakdown in that song is  funky ). Enough reading about it people, go get it. If your pockets can  afford it go for the import(like I did ) with the bonus track Poetry Girl.  Eric if your reading, good job my man. This one should take you over the  top. God bless you for the music.
