 After Gap Band III, I didn't think The Gap Band could get no better. But damn!!!! they just came out of nowhere and knocked out all competition that were dropping albums around the time this one dropped. I remember hearing  that rooster crow for the first time on Early In The Morning and the bass  just dropped. And I was like, these boys ain't playing. And how can I  forget about Outstanding. Just like Yearning For Your Love, this track was  classy and funky at the same time. And I thought Lonely Like Me was an  overlooked classic jam. Go get you a copy so you can reminisce.
