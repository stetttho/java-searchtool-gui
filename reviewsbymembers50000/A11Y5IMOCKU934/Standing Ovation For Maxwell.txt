 I just wanted to welcome this cd into the world and my cd player. He has truly done it again. Drown Deep:Hula is such a awesome song that I have to put it up there with Marvin Gaye's,"Since I Had You" and Prince's "Adore" as a sexual classic. Great performance all around for Maxwell. I'm anxious for the next release.
