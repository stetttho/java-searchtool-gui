 Wow !!!! This debut ( independent release at that)is just awesome. Black radio is missing out on some great soul music here. I won't bother suggesting a track, you just have to hear the whole thing all the way  through ( I love every song on this album). And since there's no song  listings I will do the honors for Amazon.com : 1.)Picture This 2.) Deep 3.)  Rain 4.)What's Wrong With You 5.)The Meeting 6.) See Ya In My Dreams  7.)Lonely Woman 8.) Soul From The Abyss 9.) The Sunshine 10.) Can This Be  Love 11.)I think For Sure 12.) Broke My Heart 13.) Crazy World 14.) Lonely  Woman ( Interlude ). Now go get it, it's the hottest album this year (  great for the summer ). Good job N'Dambi, look forward to more albums. I  wish you had some t-shirts made of your album cover. Peace.
