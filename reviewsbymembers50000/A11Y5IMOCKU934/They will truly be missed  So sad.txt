 When I hear Q-tip holler," for the love baby" on the track  " The Love" i can't help but get teary eyed. The reason, because  he truly means it. Him and the rest of Tribe have been doing this for the  love of it for years. I was eighteen when they dropped their first lp. And  this one sounds just as good as the first one. So to all who say this one  doesn't have the same feel as the first two are missing the whole  perspective of A Tribe Called Quest. This is a great ending? to a group who  have never compromised their sound for crossover success. For that, i  salute Tribe and thank them for the history. And to the critics, kiss  " The Booty". That's one of my favorite cuts. I love you Tribe,  you'll always be one of the top notches in my book.
