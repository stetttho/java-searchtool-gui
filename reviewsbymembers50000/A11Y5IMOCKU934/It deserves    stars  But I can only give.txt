 Let's Love, Honey, Sweet Sticky Thing, & Fopp. What more can I say. This album was a classic the minute it was released. If you must have one Ohio Players cd in your collection, make it this one. The band was so  tight. By the way also check out the track,"Alone". The  arrangement on that track alone, showed that the Ohio Players were running  things at Polygram. Go get it.
