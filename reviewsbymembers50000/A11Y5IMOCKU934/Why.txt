 Why is Polygram releasing all these greatest hits compilations on this gritty,nasty,just too tight funk band. They have to be one of the hottest groups to come out of the south. And the justice that Polygram is giving  them on these compilations aren't gonna do. They are just barely scratching  the surface of what this band has to offer. I would like to see full length  cd's by this super funk group. Cause anybody who was around when they were  in their prime knows that the party wasn't happening till there were some  Bar-Kays jams being played. Come on Polygram (Universal/Uni whatever your  calling yourself's) get with the program  and show these brother's some  love. Release the full length(Too Hot To Stop,Light Of Life,Injoy,As  One,Nightcruising,etc.)already !  Dang!  Oh, and enough with the  compilations already.
