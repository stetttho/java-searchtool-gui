 When I heard that this cd. was going to be releases I was so excited. Being the biggest fan there was of Prince's I couldn't wait. When I purchased it, I was so dissappointed with what I got. And for the first time in Prince record releasing history I was ready to throw my copy away. I nearly broke down and cried cause I felt Prince had let me down. I mean I thought Come On, The One, Until Ure In My Arms Again & When U Love Somebody were great songs. But the rest were just not what I expected from him after delivering the Crystal Ball/The Truth collection ( Yeah I know they were old vault songs) but they were touched up for a world-wide release and sounded like he had just went into the studio and whipped them up. I felt like he was trying to fit into today's way of making records. I'm not asking for an album that sounds like the past, but I won't settle either. And please, Prince if you read this no more raps on your tracks. You don't need that to make your music a! ccesible to the masses. Your stuff shines all by itself without all that gloss. And how about some of the rock tracks like the ones you put on the Gold album. Don't get me wrong, I still have a love jones for Prince's music, but I miss the pizzazz!!! Peace Xes Cainam
