 I'm very pleased with this album. I was a little nervous about this album, but when Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic kicked in the nervousness stopped. And from there on everything was alright. Undisputed was off the hook,Hot Wit U  was slamming,Tangerine took me there, So Far So Pleased rocked like  nobody's business. This album is hot all the way through. My only complaint  is that 2 of the songs were too short. I must say if your a true Prince fan  buy this cd, if your into the latest fads or radio hits this could be hard  to handle. Man 'O' War is a hot ballad y'all. Peep it and see for yourself.
