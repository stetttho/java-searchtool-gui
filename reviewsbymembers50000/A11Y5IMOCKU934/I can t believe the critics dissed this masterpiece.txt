 Truly one of his deepest works ever. I've yet to hear an artist put  heartache of a broken marriage into words like this. And the musicians just  jam all the way through this album. "Sparrow", should've been a  bonafide Marvin Gaye hit. To all I recommend this gem. Get it while the  gettin' is good. Or regret that you didn't.
