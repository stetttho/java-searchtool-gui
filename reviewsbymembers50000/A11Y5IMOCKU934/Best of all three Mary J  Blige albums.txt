 When Mary dropped this gem I was going through some life changes. And the title track alone(My Life) got me through those rough edges in my life. "Be Happy" was a anthem in my life on a daily basis. So I will  say this is the best album Mary J. Blige will ever make in her career.  Every album after this one will be just a Mary J. Blige album, but My Life  will be the one she will be remembered for. The album she bled from her  heart. And I love Mary and this album for that. Bonafide classic right  here.
