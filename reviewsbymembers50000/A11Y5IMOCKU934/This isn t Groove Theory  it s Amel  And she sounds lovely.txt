 I waited for this album since November when the radio started playing the single. And it's finally here. An album filled with heart felt and uplifting tracks (Infinite Possibilitie and I N I), songs about love that  just won't let go(Sweet Misery)and beautiful ballads she wrote for her  husband and her child(Make Me Whole and Even If). All in all, the album is  pure soulful bliss. And her angelic voice is in raw form for every track.  Do yourself a favor and pick this one up. And remember to put your  headphones on tight and just dig. You know what I'm saying ?
