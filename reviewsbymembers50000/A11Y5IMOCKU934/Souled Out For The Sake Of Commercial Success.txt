 I thought this cd was so wack, that I had to check the cd package to see if this was really Brian McKnight doing the performing on this cd. First off the rip-off jobs he was doing on songs as title track(sounds like the riff to Outside Your Door by, Me'Shell Ndegeocello) and the track The Only One For Me( stealing the riff to the R Kelly remix of I Can't Sleep Baby, yall know what I'm talking about). You Should Be Mine was another let down. And what's up with Jam Knock ? I wish artist like Brian would stick to what they know instead of listening to their A&R reps. I guess I'll just stick to the first two cd's he released. By the way those uptempo cuts on the first two cd's are way better than the crappy ones he's got on the new one. I just can't recommend this to anyone. As a matter of fact, I'm giving him two stars based on his past performances and hoping for a better outing next cd. Peace  Xes Cainam
