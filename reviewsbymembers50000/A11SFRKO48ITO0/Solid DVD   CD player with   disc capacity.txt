 The Panasonic DVD-C220 represents last year's top of the line. Some of the  newer features available this year are missing (zoom). It can't read CD-Rs  neither can any of the other players released last year. This player has  a great picture, especially the notable clarity, sharpness & color. The  sound is as good as any CD player I've used. It has 2 sets of audio/video  outs + S-VHS, component & 2 digital audio outs (1 coax + 1 optical).   Among the best features is the ability to play audio CDs and skip over  DVDs. Great if like me, you are using the DVD player as a CD player. The  on screen menus are easy to understand if you read the manual and the  indicator lights are informative as well. Plays all of the CD's and DVD's I  have tried very well and hasn't skipped yet. Even plays one CD that won't  play on my other systems. The audio is great for music and the audio on DVD  is fantastic. The disk change is not slow at all and noise is to be  expected but it is not annoying in the least. As for the tray, you can't  push it closed - you have to push the button.  If you're looking for a  multi-disc DVD/CD changer for a great price, this is a very good unit to  consider. However if CD-R compatibility is a must, I'd say go for Pioneer's  3 Disc changer. Hope this helps
