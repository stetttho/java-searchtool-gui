 These are great speakers for the price. I have compared them to center channels costing three times their price such as the Polks, JBL, and even the Infinitys and the cheaper KLH 525 sound just as good (one may think  that the sound is slightly flat when put against some 300+ dollar centers  but when combined with a good sub, surrounds and fronts, the are probably  the best value for the money) With 4 mids and a tweeter, and 125 watt  capability, I would recommend these to anyone on a tight budget who wants a  high quality speaker.  One thing I don't like from this speaker is the  housing is made of plastic...It makes itself look cheap. And it should be  deep black not dark gray. However, the weakness I found is not relevant  to its performance. So, although I would give it 3 stars for style it  certainly deserves 5 for value and performance.
