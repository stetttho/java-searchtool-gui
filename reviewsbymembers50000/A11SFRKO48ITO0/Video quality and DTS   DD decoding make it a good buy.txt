 I have to say one thing right off. This unit has played everything I've  thrown at it without a glitch, and that includes many NetFlix rental  DVD's--they show up in all levels of scratchosity. In addition to DVDs, it  plays CD-R/CD-RW/VCD. The picture quality is excellent in RGB mode and  has plenty of adjustments and memory facilities - but I tend not to use  these after inital setup - unstaturated color can also be adjusted with  Gamma correction and sharpness can be adjusted too. As for the sound,  this unit boast both DD (Dobly Digital) and DTS decoding, which means you  can save some money when buying a receiver. The Pioneer has had no problems  with anything I've seen so far.  The internal DD decoder is as good as  any I've heard (although comparisons have been difficult since I've not had  other players in my house - only in demo rooms etc...).  On the negative  side --the remote weighs about a half-ounce and the wobbly little joystick  is a little annoying, and the playe'r looks a bit 'cheap' if I may say so.  These are just external design flaws that have no effect on performance,  but I though they should be discussed anyway. Hope this helps
