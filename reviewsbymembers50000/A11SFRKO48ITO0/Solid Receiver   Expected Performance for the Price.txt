 This receiver is an excellent selection for someone looking to put  together a starter home theater. Although not the most fancy player, it  does everything a person who currently doesn't have a surround system needs  - such as built-in Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 decoding and a subwoofer  line-level out.  It has two digital audio inputs; one optical and one  co-axial. These are assignable so you don't have to worry if a device has  only an optical or a co-axial output. The unit will also do video switching  and has composite and s-video inputs and outputs (but you can't go from  s-video in to composite out). Also, it has plently of power for any starter  system: 100 Watts (peak) X 5 channels. There are enough inputs for all of  the goodies (CD, DVD, minidisc, tape, VCR.) The remote is basic and would  could have been better if it was backlit and universal. For this price,  it is understandable that the audio quality is not the clearest, but most  users will not even notice. Overall, I am very satisfied with this  product. This is a good receiver for those just entering the home theater  market or for those who are casual listeners that don't need features that  they will never use. I would recommend perhaps going with the Kenwood  VR-407 or the Pionner VSX-D409 which sell for about the same price. Hope  this helps.
