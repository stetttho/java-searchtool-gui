 This Panasonic DVD player is made in Japan, and comes with a plethora of  useful features; cinema video setting, dialogue enhancer,  "resume" function (will resume movie from where it was left off  even after powering off the unit), DTS and DD output (you still need a  receiver with the decoder) and excellent image quality. It plays all of  the major DVD titles including problem discs such as "the Matrix with  outstanding picture quality and sound.   I liked that this unit did not  display the annoying layer change delay common in other models. It was  seamless On the down side, there was no Chapter access from the remote.  What I mean is that I was unable to access the Chapters directly via the  numeric pad. I think the only way to access the Chapter directly (say from  Chapter 1 to Chapter 18) is by pressing the display button first, then  pressing the fast forward button once to C, and then enter the Chapter  number via the numeric pad. This is very cumbersome.  The remote could  also be larger and backlit.  Overall, the image and soud quality are  excellent and the player performs well with any DVD. It dous not earn five  stars because of the faulty chapter access feature and the remote - but  these may be flaws many users will not mind at all. Hope this helps.
