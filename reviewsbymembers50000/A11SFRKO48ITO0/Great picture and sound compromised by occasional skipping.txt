 For those who don't want to spend too much, the 611 is a solid player. The  only problem that I have is the occasional video skip. It has skipped maybe  two or three times, but they only last about 1/2 a second. The picture and  sound quality is great, even without surround sound. I usually experience  one video glitch per dvd, start to finish. Other than that, the video is  crystal clear.  Using the optical output, the audio quality I get when  playing cd's comes very close in comparison to my high end system in the  living room. For the price  I can't complain about a little glitch once in  a while. Hope this helps
