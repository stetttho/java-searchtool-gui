 The Konka player manufanctured by one of china's major TVmakers, boasts notable quality for the price. Aside from the slick silver styling, the 1800U is a fairly typical bottom-end DVD player. One major bonus not found on other inexpensive DVDs is both kinds of digital outputs, optical and coaxial. There's no DTS decoding, however.  It has a very low price with a lot of features that you only see on the more expensive units (S-video, multi angle options, etc.). One of the player's great strengths is its ability to play CD/VCD/CD-R The DD 5.1 seems right on target, but it is not DTS compatiple. BEWARE: After asking friends and people at work, I have come to question its initial performance. It seems some players have been equiped with a 300MA fuse which blows easily instead of a 350MA one.  I found that the first batch of units had a power supply problem where the player would suddenly stop working, usually with a DVD in it. Konka USA will replace those units free of charge, or you can fix it yourself by replacing and power supply fuse with correct type. Regardless of the fuse, the unit generates a lot of heat. But it seams like the units on sale by Amazon are new enough that the problem has been fixed.  I price is an issue and you are not sure about buying a DVD player from an unknown manufacture, try some by Phillips or RCA. Otherwise, spend an extra [money] to get a reliable player. Hope this helps.
