 I love the oak design, since it blends so well with my living room. I  would recommend this system to anyone wanting to intensify their DVD  experience. The sound it very clean, but not overbearing or  "tinny" with its silk tweater. The dual drivers with the silk  tweater provide a comfortable listening experience. Clear, accurate, sharp  appearance and sound, Good build quality and hardware. A word about the  size: if you have size constraints, be careful, it will not rest lightly on  your TV.  I'm trying to limit my bias, but I liked the sound of this  center speaker so much I bought two more for rear speakers. MFM-7s left  right, modus music centers, center and rear. Matched up with a Yamaha 795  receiver and a decent Polk sub, your in DD or DTS Heaven! NOTE: This same  speaker is avaliable in Rosewood (a darker red color) which may do better  to blend with your room design.
