 This is just the best of several annotated G & S libretto collections that have been published over the years.  It is actually a republication (with revisions) of two paperbacks by Bradley published some years earlier.  They are listed as out of print, which they are, but that doesn't matter with this excellently produced single volume now available.  Bradley doesn't have space to give us the last word on all aspects of the operas, but he is exhaustive on the texts, and no real G & S fan can afford not to have this on the shelf.  The only other one to look for (it is out of print) is the volume by Martyn Green because his notes include a lot of valuable information about staging.
