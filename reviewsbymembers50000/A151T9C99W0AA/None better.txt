 It is inconceivable to me and my wife that there could ever be a better screen adaptation of Austen's masterpiece.  Certainly there hasn't been one until now. Mrs. Bennett is a little over-the-top, but all of the other  characterizations are superb.  We have watched this repeatedly with only a  month or two between viewings, and it holds up exceedingly well.  Like all  great works, each time you watch, you see something you missed before.  We  don't have the self-control to watch it one episode a week, as it was  produced.  We typically start about 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon, watch  the first three episodes, break for dinner, and then watch the rest.   (Sometimes we even eat while watching the second half!)  If you love  Austen, this certainly will not disappoint you.
