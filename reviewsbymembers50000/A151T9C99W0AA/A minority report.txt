 I was delighted to return to Darkover, but I have some reservations about its new chronicler.  There's no way Ross can satisfactorily imitate Bradley, so all Darkover fans have to accept that there has been a change.  Perhaps some constructive criticism can be offered to help with the awesome challenge Ross faces as Bradley's successor.  For example, more care with diction would be a good thing.  I believe that Bradley was careful not to use words or expressions inconsistent with Darkover's own history.  "Neskaya" has quite a few that I think Bradley would have avoided as too redolent of Earth: topiary, "trust a fox to guard a coop of chickens" (are there foxes on Darkover now?), flat-fell seams, war-room, various herbs from earth in food for the first time, and dragons (there weren't any before).  Finally, I think this book is too long by about 20% and that Ross flirts with sentimentality in both plotting and writing.  Bradley was pretty tough-minded, and Darkover is a tough place.  In spite of these reservations, I enjoyed the book and look forward to the next from Ross, even while I ask if this is really going to sustain a trilogy.
