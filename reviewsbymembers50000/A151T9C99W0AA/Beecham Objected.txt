 I have not heard this release of the recording, but potential purchasers should be aware that it is the soundtrack of the ballet version film of the opera.  They should also be aware that when it was first released on LP 40-odd years ago, Beecham sued to try to stop it.  He said it was performed for a specific purpose - - to accompany dancers - - and misrepresented how he would conduct it for a regular opera performance.  The film is excellent, butI have heard the soundtrack recording and have to agree with Sir Thomas.  It makes for strange listening.  Folks looking for a good recording of the opera as an opera, not a ballet, should look elsewhere.
