 At last we have the Sills "Lucia."  The wait has been frustrating, but it has now been wonderfully made worth while.  From her first utterance, Sills's Lucia foreshadows her end in the tone of mental instability of her every phrase.  There are no weaknesses in Sills's performance (or any of the others, for that matter), and Schippers leads a tight, propulsive production, keenly aware of the drama and of the requirements of bel canto opera.  Technically, the 1970 recording shows its age, but only in direct comparison with more recent versions.  There is one (tiny) flaw: 17 measures of the orchestral introduction to the opening chorus are missing; does anyone know if this was true of the original LP release or may be the result of some carelessness in preparing the CD transfer?  As noted, the flaw is tiny and should not by any means discourage anyone from buying this set for all of the splendid pleasures it has to offer, not least in the use of the glass harmonica for the Mad Scene: it really transports you into the world of the demented.  Buy it and enjoy bel canto opera at its best.
