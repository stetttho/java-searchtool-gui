 It's terrific to have the Ian Carmichael series of Lord Peter Wimsey novels available on DVD, and I hope the rest of the original series will soon follow those now up.  This one is excellent entertainment, and I have no criticism of the adaptation or the acting or the production.  My only negative comment is that it would have made the DVD release more friendly if the episodes had been edited together, with credits shown only at the beginning and end of each disc.  It's a nuisance to have to navigate around this stuff.  The producers of the best "Pride and Prejudice" did this to greatly improved presentation in its most recent release.  I hope the Wimsey releases from Acorn will do it in the future.
