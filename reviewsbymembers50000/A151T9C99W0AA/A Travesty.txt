 I guess I'm in the minority among reviewers, but I'll stick with my opinion that this is a travesty of Austen's matchless novel.   (I'd give it no stars if the system allowed.)  Virtually every production detail -- the costumes, the hair styles, the number of people at the balls, failure to show Darcy's attraction to Lizzy from the first, behavior of individual characters (Bingley's entering Jane's room in the night, Lady Catherine's pounding on the door for a night time visit), the ludicrous sculpture gallery at Pemberley etc. etc. -- is wrong.  The abilities of such actors as Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland are wasted by a script that essentially gives them nothing worthwhile to do.  They are reduced to being little more than set decoration.  A single feature film cannot include everything in the novel, of course (the much praised 1995 BBC production left things out, too), but a better script would more truly reflect the original, and none of the production details listed can be explained as necessary because of the limitations of adaptation.  Even the old Greer Garson-Laurence Olivier film, which is pretty bad, is a better adaptation than this one.  If you want "Pride and Prejudice" in video form, get either of the BBC adaptations for a version far closer to what Austen wrote.
