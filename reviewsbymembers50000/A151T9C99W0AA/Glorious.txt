 I had the great good fortune to be a student in Boston during some of Munch's years with the BSO.  He took what he inherited from Koussevitzky, maintained, and made it even better!  His Beethoven 9th is absolutely my favorite recording of it.  It should be avoided if you want ponderous profundity, but if you want humanity and life, this is the one you want.  It is worth the price alone, but there is nothing wrong with the other pieces in the set, especially the Martinu symphony, which Munch and the BSO premiered.  If you don't know Munch's work, this is a good place to start.  But don't overlook the rest of his discography, especially the ground-breaking recordings of Berlioz.
