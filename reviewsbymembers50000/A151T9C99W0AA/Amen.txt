 I cannot add anything really useful to what others have already said praising this exhaustive book.  I can add a warning: don't sit down to browse in this in the evening.  If you do, you're apt to find yourself resurfacing an hour or two past your bedtime.  (But it will have been a most enjoyable delay.)
