 Some people think you have to be "3 years old or in a coma" to enjoy this film.  Rubbish!  My wife and I are well-educated and well into our "senior" years, but far from senile.  We think this is one of Spielberg's very best, an unmitigated treat from beginning to end.  The cast is superb from top to bottom, and we also think John Williams's score has some of his very best music.  (For confirmation, listen to the series of excerpts he recorded with the Boston Pops by programing your player to skip the other tracks.  Each piece stands on its own without the film's images to support it.)  Finally, we think those who hate the film have the same problem Peter has when he first sits down to "eat" with the Lost Boys in  Neverland: a lack of imagination and sense of fun.  They need to loosen up and, as the saying goes, get a life.
