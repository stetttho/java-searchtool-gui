 I haven't got much patience with the readers who are busy picking nits instead of enjoying the book!  I've read all the other Pern books and found this one utterly enjoyable, too, after a slightly slow start.  The great radio serial writer Csrlton E. Morse ("One Man's Family", "I Love a Mystery")once told me that he figured he didn't need to worry too much about detailed consistency as long as he made each episode absorbing.  McCaffrey is a terrific storyteller, and her ability to absorb the reader in what she is telling is clearly displayed in this, the 16th book in the Pern series.  If you read while commuting, be warned that McCaffrey's narrative can transfix you at some points and make you miss your stop!  This is not the first book to read for newcomers to Pern because there are references that won't be readily understood; newcomers should begin with "Dragonriders of Pern" (available from Amazon!) and read one or two of the others before coming to "Skies."  I agree that another book in the series is clearly indicated at the end of this one, and I can hardly wait for it to appear!
