 A musician of Willson's considerable talent and achievements deserves a better book than this one, but unfortunately there is no other.  This is really a chamber of commerce puff piece about the favorite son of Mason City, Iowa.  There is no serious, detailed analysis of Willson's work.  The style is that of newspaper Sunday supplements, repetitious and superficial.  It is also sprinkled with errors.  Some of them may be the result of careless proofreading, but others are clearly the author's mistakes.  For example, Frank Morgan played the wizard not the tin man in "The Wizard of Oz"; Suppe's overture is "Light Cavalry" not "Light Calvary"; WACs were not in the Women's Air Corps, but Women's Army Corps; the famous "Command Performance" of "Dick Tracy in B-flat" was 60 minutes long, not 90, and bits of the dialogue are inaccurately quoted; and tape recording did not come to the US until after World War II.  With this many easily spotted mistakes, one has to wonder about the accuracy of the entire book.
