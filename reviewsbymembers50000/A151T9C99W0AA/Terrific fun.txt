 My wife and I never saw these films in the theater, and we regret that, but we spent the weekend just past watching all three of them plus the bonus materials.  And we had a terrific time!  The series started as a kind of homage to the old Saturday matinee serials, but these are far better than they ever were.  They don't "cheat" getting Indy out of trouble, whereas one of the serials would push a hero off a cliff one week and the next week you'd find out that it wasn't really a cliff.  We agree with Stephen Spielberg (in the bonus material) that "The Last Crusade" is the best of the three, but "Raiders" is a lot of uninhibited fun.  The squeamish should approach "Temple of Doom" warily, and we rank it third for being a bit too far over the top in its violence.   The bonus material is good, but there could have been more.  The only disappointment came in the music featurette: John Williams has a presentation he does with film clips in concerts to show how a score gets matched to a film in the recording studio.  It uses young Indy's escape with the Coronado Cross and would have been perfect for inclusion to demonstrate concretely how Williams accomplishes at least part of his work.  This is, however, a minor letdown.  The three films are an over-all outstanding achievement by everyone, and we're looking forward to a fourth film if that becomes possible.
