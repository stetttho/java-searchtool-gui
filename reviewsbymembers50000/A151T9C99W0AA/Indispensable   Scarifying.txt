 Books about the men who fought World War II tend to romanticize their subject, sometimes more than a little, especially recently.  This book should be read as soon as possible by anyone who thinks that war was (or present and future ones can be) noble, uplifting, or even fun.  It wasn't, as Fussell demonstrates in clear and unambiguous prose.  He points out that the army in Western Europe was made up chiefly of 17-, 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds who had no notion of what would confront them on the beaches of Normandy or in its hedgerows or in the slave-labor camps inside Nazi Germany itself, and he tells the reader plainly what actually did confront them. The book is not for the weak-stomached, but it's a much-needed corrective for those of us who've subscribed uncritically to the "Greatest Generation" view.  As Fussell makes clear, that generation "included among the troops and their officers plenty of criminals, psychopaths, cowards, and dolts."  It is a superb little book of only 165 pages of text.
