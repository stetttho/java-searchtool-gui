 I can not expand on the excellent review by Steve, but I want to second his praise.  My wife and I were fortunate enough to see her in person (Hershey, PA) when she was starting to hit the heights.  We sat in about row 10 and got the full impact of her energy and enormous talent.  We were pinned to the backs of our seats and then lifted off them.  Anyone who loves electrifying performances cannot afford to miss this CD or the forthcoming DVD - - and turn up the volume on your speakers when you play them!
