 among those who think this is an absolutely terrific film.  I lived in the times portrayed, and this is an accurate picture of those times.  I won't take time and space to repeat everything others have said in praise of everyone connected with the film.  Just two personal reactions: an urge to cheer because of the excellence of the film; an urge to weep for our country because Murrow's warning that TV could easily become only lights and wires in a box has come resoundingly true.
