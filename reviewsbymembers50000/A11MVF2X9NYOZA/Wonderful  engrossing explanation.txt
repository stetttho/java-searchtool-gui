 This is a great book.  It's like a very detailed version of the little "string art" animation of evolution in Sagan's "Cosmos" series.  The book includes copious diagrams of species and their relationships, body morphology through successive species, and interesting drawings of many selected species along the ancestry of Hominids.  It's geared for, maybe, 12 to 15 year old kids, though my five year old loves me to read sections, and I pore over it too!
