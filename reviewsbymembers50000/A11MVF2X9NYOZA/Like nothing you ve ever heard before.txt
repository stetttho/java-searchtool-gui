 ... unless, I have to guess, you've spent time in Okinawa. I bought this CD at random from a used CD bin about five years ago. When I spun it up for the first time that evening, I almost fell over with amazement. I'm  listening to it right now and that feeling hasn't changed. With no  disrespect meant to Okinawans or their music, I'll attempt to describe this  as sounding like ... well, no, never mind. It's happy, upbeat in the purest  sense, and wierdly catchy. The songs simply will not let go of your head.  Read the lyric sheet for a further treat, as you learn that people really  can write great songs about the simplest things in the world. Buy this  album and treasure it.
