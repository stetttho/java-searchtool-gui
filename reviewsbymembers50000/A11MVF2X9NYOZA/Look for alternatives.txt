 When shopping for cookware, you really should look out for: 1) materials -- what's the pan made of?  What's the durability of the surface?  Calphalon only rates so-so for me here.  It's fairly thick aluminum, but these pans DO warp over time. 2) pan shape -- I use the "pouring" test, which is all about how the pan lip is designed.  Calphalon fails big for me here. 3) pan manipulability -- I really don't like the new swoopy Calphalon handles.  They're smooth and curvy and narrow, making it very hard to control the pan when lifting or partially lifting it off the fire. There are plenty of good cookware manufacturers out there.  My money definitely goes elsewhere after some considerable experience with a large set of Calphalon.
