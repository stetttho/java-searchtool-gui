 Well, the price is right for what we were looking for: a simple interactive keyboard coupled with light-weight training software. However, as is so depressingly often the case with kid-oriented software, the usability of the system leaves a LOT to be desired. First, if your child can't read and you're not prepared to help them through all the little "games" included, forget it - "Help" instructions are for the most part print-only.  The included games have somewhat complicated mechanics, but there's not much of a point to any of them. Also - and this seems quite odd - the games aren't all centered on using the keyboard! In fact the lack of "purity" in the software with respect to the little piano keyboard is probably the biggest flaw.  The mouse is  really required to actually get through the user interface, and that's a logistical issue for me (where do I put it, once I've used up the desk with the keyboard?). The "Lesson" section is extremely basic, and again requires the mouse for quite a bit of it (!!). The software is annoying in its responsiveness, often insisting on completing a little cut scene before allowing any interaction.
