 I owned one of these for over a year, using it almost exclusively for bread dough.  I found that I could not completely process a batch bigger than 4 cups of flour, and even then the motor would stall quite frequently once the dough began to reach the finished state (which is exactly when the mixer would be the most useful). Eventually, after a day on which I prepared four loaves, the motor simply failed. To their credit, Kitchenaid sent me a brand new "Artisan" model mixer, and explained that they were not yet replacing the big machines due to some engineering problems (which I'm pretty sure were unrelated to my issues; something about confectioner's sugar gumming up the on-off switch). If you're making cookie dough and primarily using the whisks or the main beater, the Kitchenaid is a great machine.  ....
