 The graphics (and overall production values) for this volume are top notch. However, I've found numerous glaring typographical errors (mostly  involving dates), which seem pretty bad for something intended as a  condensed historical reference. Inevitably, much of the historical gloss  is severely simplified. A substantial bibliography would have been of great  value. However, the "Selected Bibliography" is really limited.
