 If you know who John Kirby was and what the band was about, then there's no point reading any reviews.  If you're here because you're randomly bopping around Amazon looking for interesting music, then I encourage you to buy this album.  There's nothing but fun here: it's pure joy to listen to.  Pop classical passages set to classic swing orchestrations by a super-tight ensemble - what more could you want? It's fantastic.  Listen to this music and beautiful people will fall in love with you.
