 This is an entertaining adventure novel by Wilbur Smith.  Although this is not one of his better ones, it is one that will keep the reader entertained.   The story is about a group of mercenaries who are sent to retrieve a collection of diamonds under the guise of rescuing some people who are in danger during a revolt.  It is a story that any Wilbur Smith fan will enjoy.  For anyone who has never read him before, I would recommend starting with 'Hungry as the Sea' or the Courtney series, which is fantastic.  The first one in that collection is: 'When the Lion Feeds.'
