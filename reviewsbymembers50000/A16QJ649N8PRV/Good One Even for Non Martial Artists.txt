 Jennifer Lawler's 'Dojo Wisdom' is a valuable book that contains: '100 Simple Ways to Become a Stronger, Calmer, More Courageous Person'.  Although this book is a very good one for martial artists to read and absorb, it is also one that contains a great deal of value for anyone.  Although most people probably think of them as physical pursuits, those who practice the traditional martial arts place a great emphasis on the mental aspects involved.  Lawler has captured many of these and given practical applications in all areas of life.  Even in sections with titles like `Speed is power' and `Never Lose Sight of the Blade' that sound very much like martial arts topics, Ms. Lawler has provided tips on how to incorporate these nuggets of wisdom into one's everyday life.  Although I read it straight through, it might be good to read and ponder one of these lessons each day so that each can be focused upon for a time.  This book will be worth your time.
