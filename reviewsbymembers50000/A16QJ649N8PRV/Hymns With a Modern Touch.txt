 This is an enjoyable CD which takes some old hymns and gives them a modern touch.  For the most part, the update is a country sound.  Amy Grant has a voice that is superb.  She gave a very good performance on several of these songs.  In particular, I like her versions of 'Rock of Ages', and 'Abide With Me'.  She has a great sounding version of 'El Shaddai' on here, but of course this is not the only CD of hers where one could find that.  For those who enjoy a modern twist on old hymns, this is a worthwhile collection.  I would also recommend the recent CDs by 'Passion' and 'Jars of Clay' which have also done that.
