 As one who has really enjoyed several of Baldacci's books in the past, I am very disappointed with 'The Camel Club'.    It combines several ridiculously absurd 'coincidences' with bizarre 'heros' and throws in lots of 'Blame America for all the world's woes'.   It is hard to believe that the author of 'Absolute Power' has fallen to this.  A couple of the totally unbelievable parts are 1) A plot by Islamic terrorists to kidnap the president of the United States where they make sure that they don't kill any Americans, and 2) A group of conspiracy buff misfits (The Camel Club) who just happen to have a relationship with the Secret Service agent investigating a murder that they witnessed.  The  strange story lines do not end there either.  In addition, the author seems to have fallen into the mold of the Richard North Patterson of recent books by turning a piece of fiction into a propaganda piece for his own leftist views.  I recommend that you save your money.  If you've really liked Baldacci in the past and want to give it a try, I'd suggest at least waiting until it comes out in paperback.
