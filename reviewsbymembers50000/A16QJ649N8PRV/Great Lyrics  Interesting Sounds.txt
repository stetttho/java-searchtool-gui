 Prior to buying this CD, the only song that I had heard from it was 'Open Skies'.  I enjoyed that one, but was unsure about what I was getting into with this CD.  I found it to be a very interesting mix of genres with strong Christian lyrics throughout.  Although I thought it was pretty good the first time I listened to it, it has grown on me more each time I hear it.  Some of the songs that I particularly like are as follows:  Revolutionary Love, O Praise Him, All Creatures # 2, Deliver Me, and Heaven Came Down.  If you are looking for something with a little different sound but solid Christian worship lyrics, this would be a good choice.  I recommend it.
