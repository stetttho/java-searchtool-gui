 'Safely Home' is a gripping novel that will challenge the reader in a big way.    Alcorn has a way of writing that makes one feel like he is right there - in China being brutalized by a repressive government and in Heaven experiencing the endless wonders there.  He raises a strong awareness of the issues faced by the persecuted Church and the very deep commitment necessary for surviving in those systems.  It contains a beautiful portrayal of Heaven along with the vivid depiction of the persecution of Christians in China.  In combining these two topics, Alcorn has written a story that is hard to put down.    I would highly recommend this book for Christians.  It might not be the best one for pre-Christians as it may come across as a bit preachy in places.  I also recommend two other Alcorn novels: 'Deadline' and 'Dominion'.  Another one that is a great book by him is the non-fiction book 'Heaven'.  He is an author who will really challenge the stereotypical view of Heaven.  When he is writing, Heaven is always portrayed as an extremely desirable and exciting place.  He certainly doesn't see it as a land of endless harp music.
