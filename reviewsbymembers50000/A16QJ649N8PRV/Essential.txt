 This dictionary is an essential reference for any serious or even frequent Scrabble player.  The biggest advantage of this particular dictionary is that it standardizes what is acceptable when playing.  Anyone who has ever played without an agreement on what constitutes the acceptable words knows that there are far too many dictionaries out there to easily agree upon one without an official one such as this.  That being said, it is not a dictionary that one can use to get definitions of words.  Many times it will only define one usage of a word even when there are others as its purpose is to define what is acceptable in Scrabble play.  It is invaluable in terms of listing words that a regular Scrabble player needs to know such as two letter words, 'Q' words that don't require a 'U', etc.  One who is a frequent player will probably want to supplement this by getting a list of two letter words from the National Scrabble Association.  That is definitely a good idea as it would be very difficult to be a very competent player without knowing all of those.  This dictionary does list countless words that a player may need in different situations such as qat, suq, zyzzyva, etc.  It certainly does need to be updated.  There are lots of words that have become commonplace in recent years that are not in this such as spam, email, blog, latte, etc.    It is still the best out there for Scrabble players and is really an essential for playing the game.
