 This CD by MercyMe is a very pleasant sounding collection solid Christian lyrics.  There is one absolute standout song on here which is 'I Can Only Imagine'.  That song alone makes the CD well worth the price.  There are some other good tracks as well.  I also really like 'I Worship You'.  'I Can Only Imagine' is powerful at stimulating thoughts of what it will be like to be in Jesus' presence.  It has incredibly moving lyrics and a great sound.
