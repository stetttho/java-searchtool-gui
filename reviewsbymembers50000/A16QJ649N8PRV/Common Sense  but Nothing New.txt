 The stated purpose of this book is to help you figure out who really cares about you and who does not.  The author claims that if you do that, your life will be much better and you will probably live longer.  The rest of the book is a lot like the statements above.  It has some common sense 'wisdom', but nothing that is really new or Earth shattering.  O'Reilly quips that problem solving is what differentiates successful people from those in the penitentiaries.  Although that may be one factor, the statement is pretty simplistic and misses several other differences.  O'Reilly states that this book will 'give you the edge'.  This claim is a bit overstated.  I didn't run across anything in this book that is much more than run of the mill advice.    Throughout the book, he does a good job of pointing out many types of people and institutions that can be and often are not 'looking out for you'.  These include some parents, certain types of 'friends', the government, the entertainment industry, the media, the Courts, the ACLU, Jessie Jackson, the educational system, and many politicians.  There are some quite good things such as some keys that he gives for good parenting, but these are not unique to this book.  Another thing that he does hammer home quite well is the suggestion to avoid 'toxic' people whether in romantic relationships or otherwise.    I wasn't disappointed in this book as it was given to me as an audio book that I listened to while on a recent road trip.  I might have been a little less pleased had I read the book itself when I could have been reading something more worthwhile or entertaining.
