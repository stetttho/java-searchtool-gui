 WOW Hits 2005 is a great compilation of Christian hits for the year.  As most people probably don't have albums from all of these artists, this is a cost effective way to obtain them.  There are a couple of songs that I didn't care for a lot.  Excluding those, there are still about 30 outstanding songs in this collection.  You will certainly be in for a major treat with this CD.   There are so many great songs here that I can't even really list my favorites.  It would take up too much space.  Buy it and enjoy.
