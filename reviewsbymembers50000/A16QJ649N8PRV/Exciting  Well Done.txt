 This is an action packed thriller from start to finish.  It is a very fast paced story that is very well done.  This book is an end times novel based upon Exekiel 38-39.  Rosenberg has developed a plausible interpretation of those Scriptures and developed a great novel around them.  I read both of the author's previous novels, "The Last Jihad" and "The Last Days".  While both were excellent, he has definitely taken this one to a new level.  Even if you are not a big reader of novels, I would recommend this one.
