 Unfortunately Mr. Wead used highly unethical tactics in writing this book.  He has admitted that he secretly taped Pres. Bush (then Gov. Bush) in researching this book.  Not only that, but he then decided to play the tapes for the media to promote this book.  Mr. Wead has shown that he is seriously ethically challenged and certainly not a friend as he was purporting himself to be.
