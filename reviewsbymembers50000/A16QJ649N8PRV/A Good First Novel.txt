 This book had a very strong start, but did not end as well.  It was entertaining with a good plot and interesting characters for the most part.  The last third of the story was quite predictable with plot lines that paralleled earlier events far too closely for believability.  That being said, it was the author's first novel so I would rate it very highly as a debut.  Set mostly in Afghanistan, it covered time frames from the monarchy days in the early 70s through the Soviet invasion/occupation up through the Taliban times.  It focuses strongly on relationships:  friends, brothers, father/son, master/servant.  There are incidents of loyalty, betrayal, and redemption.  The characters are well developed.  It contains a lot of background on the daily life in Afghanistan from different perspectives.  There are also lots of insights into life there under the brutal regimes of the Soviets and the Taliban.  This book will likely appeal to a wide variety of readers.  It is a quick read and very enjoyable.
