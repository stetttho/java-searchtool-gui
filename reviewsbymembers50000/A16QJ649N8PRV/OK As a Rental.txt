 This film did an adequate job of entertainment. It is far from a great one though.   Although it purports to be a 'thriller', this version of 'The Manchurian Candidate' is too predictable and has too many holes in its logic.   The story is basically about an 'evil corporation' that plots to have its person planted in the vice presidency with the assistance of his twisted mother who is portrayed as incestuous in one scene. There is never any connection made with what the motive would be for the company in going to all of this trouble. It seems like they could just as easily buy their person with campaign contributions as seems to happen with some regularity.   In another spot, the hero, played by Denzel Washington, attempts to appeal to the conscience of the automaton to call off his nefarious scheme. The creators of the movie didn't ever connect the dots on how one could control a person as a robot on one hand and appeal to his 'noble side' on the other.  This is probably ok as a rental, however, I wouldn't recommend buying it.
