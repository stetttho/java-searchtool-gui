 Switchfoot has put together another album with positive lyrics and an interesting sound.  Their style is a bit hard to categorize.  They range from rather mellow to energetic rock.  The lyrics in this album tackle subjects such as materialism, the sexualization of advertising, and the disconnected nature of modern society.  They have some subtle Christian messages in the wording.  One has to really pay attention to the lyrics to pick up on them however.  Although I would personally prefer a more explicit Christian message, Switchfoot's approach has some positive aspects.  They receive a lot of play on mainstream radio stations which allows them to reach a much wider audience than many Christian bands.  If you are looking for an album to buy for a young person who isn't into contemporary Christian music, this would be a good choice.  I would also recommend their album 'Beatiful Letdown', which I personally like better than this one.  This one tends to grow on me more the more I listen to it.
