 In 'Right From Wrong' Josh McDowell analyzes how the current generation of youth has lost a Biblically based value system and provides helpful advice to parents, pastors, youth workers, etc.    This work was based upon a major study that was conducted on 3,795 'evangelical churched youth'.  In many cases the results are quite shocking.  The bottom line is that even Christian young people today don't perceive an objective standard of morality.  Instead, they tend to view such standards as based upon individual preferences, much as the culture in general does.  McDowell analyzes the forces that have influenced this shift going back to its roots at the end of the middle ages.  He tracks the changes through the past century including influences by the media, public schools, etc.  One of the main findings is that the changes in family structures, particularly the amounts of time that parents spend with their children since the end of WWII has created huge changes.  This is a book that all Christian parents should read if they are concerned about passing their values on to the next generation.
