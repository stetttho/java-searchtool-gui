 Nicole Nordeman's latest album 'Brave' is a solid effort with a couple of really standout songs.  The title track, 'Brave', is a very good one that has gotten a lot of radio play.  Although I really like it, I think the best song on the album is 'What If'.  It has a good sound, is very catchy, and has powerful lyrics.  I would recommend that anyone who is skeptical of Christianity listen to and ponder this song.  It poses some questions that anyone who doubts may want to ponder about Jesus.  Here are some of the lyrics:  What if you're right And He was just another nice guy  What if you're right What if it's true They say the cross will only make a fool of you  And what if it's true? What if he takes his place in history With all the prophets and the kings Who taught us love and came in peace  But then the story ends What then?  But what if you're wrong?   What if there's more? What if there's hope you never dreamed of hoping for?  What if you jump?   And just close your eyes? What if the arms that catch you, catch you by surprise?  What if He's more than enough? What if it's love  What if you dig Way down deeper than your simple-minded friends What if you dig What if you find A thousand more unanswered questions down inside That's all you find  What if you pick apart the logic? And begin to poke the holes What if the crown of thorns is no more than folklore that must be told and retold  You've been running as fast as you can You've been looking for a place you can land for so long But what if you're wrong?
