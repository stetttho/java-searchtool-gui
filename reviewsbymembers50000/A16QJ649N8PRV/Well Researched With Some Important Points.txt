 This is an expose with solid documentation.  It will validate what any astute observer of things political already knows.    Although Mr. Schweizer does an excellent job of pointing out some incredible hypocrisy by several leading liberal elitists, these inconsistencies are really just illustrations of larger issues.  The two key things that one can take away from this book are these:  First, the major media is so biased in favor of its liberal soulmates that the partisan news organizations do not reveal the types of utter hypocrisy outlined here.  Of course, we all know that they would if the hypocrites involved were conservatives.  Secondly, it is obvious that while the liberals profiled may want to force their ideology on everyone else, they evidently want to function under conservative type ideas in their own lives.  The author gives numerous examples of the wide gap between the words and deeds of the eleven limousine liberals portrayed here.  Although many liberals may actually believe what they preach, the crowd in this book does not.  That is very significant as some of the ones portrayed here are among the 'elites' of the liberal philosophy.  This is certainly a worthwhile book.
