 This is a collection with several good songs and a few very good ones.    Mercy Me has solid Christian lyrics combined with a very pleasant light rock sound.  Three songs that really stand out on this CD are the following:  'Here With Me', 'In The Blink of An Eye', and 'Homesick'.    It is pretty good for all ages.
