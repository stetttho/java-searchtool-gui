 This is a strong collection of songs by Avalon.  Although I've heard several of these songs, I have never had an Avalon CD before.  I have been quite pleased with this group of songs.    The songs have solid Christian lyrics.  The sound is a lighter pop sound.  It is very upbeat and some of the songs are pretty catchy.  Some of the one that I particularly like are as follows:  'Everything To Me', 'Testify To Love', 'Adonai', 'Always Have, Always Will', and 'The Glory'.    This is definitely worth a listen.
