 Supernatural is another great CD by DC Talk.  As usual, they have combined superb vocals, great instrumentals, and positive, Christian lyrics.  This CD includes several different genres.  Very few groups could pull off such a diverse mix and still have such a fantastic sound.  The lyrics are always uplifting and expressely Christian.  There are no bad songs in this collection.  There are some that are terrific.  I particularly like 'Dive', 'Consume Me', 'Into Jesus', and 'Red Letters'.    If you are not familiar with DC Talk, do yourself a favor and try them.  If you are already a fan, but don't have this CD, you will want to get it.  'Supernatural' is another great album to add to any collection.  Highly recommended!
