     Frank Schaeffer put together a decent story of a series of summer vacations from the eyes of a teenage boy. Unfortunately, it was much less than it could have been.   The story itself was quite well done. It had several funny parts and lots of insights into family dynamics.   On the negative side, the details seemed a bit too close to Schaeffer's own personal history. It made it seem more autobiographical. If that was the case as it appears to have been, it seemed to be filled with cheap shots taken at the expense of his family and his deceased father, in particular.   This really came across as mean spiritedness by a son who seems to have some deep seated resentments against his father and is attacking him now that dad isn't alive and thus can't defend himself.   Due to the approach that he took in this book, I will certainly be passing on the other volumes in this trilogy. I also wouldn't recommend Portofino.
