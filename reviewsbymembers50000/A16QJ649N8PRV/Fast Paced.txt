 Jeffrey Archer has written another fast paced novel with lots of twists and turns.  Although I wouldn't classify this one as a great story, it is very good.  Most readers will be hooked into it early and stay that way throughout.  This particular story involves an international assassin, crooked businessmen, the theft of a priceless Van Gogh, murder, and mayhem.  There is no shortage of action or adventure.  There is one slight negative with this book.  It was set beginning on 9/11/01 with some of the events in the book relating peripherally to the infamous events of that day.  I don't think that was necessary or particularly helpful to the plot.  The author could have done the same story without involving 9/11 and had just as good of a story.  In spite of that one slight negative, this book is very readable and entertaining.
