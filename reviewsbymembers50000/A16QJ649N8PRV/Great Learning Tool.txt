 This is an excellent primer on basic accounting.  It is an effective learning tool that takes a subject that is usually pretty dry and makes it interesting.  The approach used is taking a child's lemonade stand business and demonstrating accounting principles through the operation of this endeavor.  Many educators could learn some lessons from this approach about how to teach seemingly boring subjects without putting students to sleep.  Those who are writing books on other topics might also learn a lesson or two from the authors of this book.  It does a thorough job of teaching about the basic financial statements:  Income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.  It also covers FIFO, LIFO, and accrual vs. cash methods very well.  It does not cover some of the other accounting principles that can be confusing such as the accounting debit vs. credit entries.  Although it does miss covering some important topics, I heartily recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn or brush up on the basics of accounting.
