 The only complaint that I have with this fabulous book is that it is too short.  It got over far too quickly for me.  Dr. Woods does a terrific job of correcting many of the historical fallacies that are taught in public schools.  Those who are hard core partisans will probably not care for his painful truths as both Republican and Democrat figures are exposed for their ineptitudes.  Some of the areas that he educates readers so well on are these:  Antitrust laws have harmed consumers; every military endeavor we have been involved in since WWII has been unconstitutional (no declaration of war by Congress); Herbert Hoover's policies that led to the Great Depression were not because he was a free market advocate, but because of his big government policies.  This is a book that should be read by any American who is interested in the truth about history, rather than the politically correct propaganda that is so often portrayed as history.    I just hope that the author follows this up with a much more comprehensive work dealing with many more aspects of our history.   I would not only highly recommend this; I think it is a must read.
