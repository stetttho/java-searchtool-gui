 This is the first book that I have read by James Scott Bell.  It won't be the last.  'Blind Justice' is a legal thriller with colorful characters and an interesting storyline.  It also features people who are struggling with issues of faith, the existence of God, personal battles, and even spiritual warfare.  The story has quite a few unexpected twists and turns and is definitely a page turner.  If you have not read anything by Mr. Bell, I would recommend checking this out.
