 This is an excellent and entertaining film that depicts the spirit of sports at its best.  The basic storyline features the fall and rise of former world heavyweight boxing champion James J. Braddock.  He went from being a top ranked fighter in the 1920s to a down on his luck fighter struggling to feed his family during the Great Depression.  He fought poorly in a series of fights when he had a broken hand just to put food on the table.  Eventually he had his boxing license suspended for his poor performances.  Soon he was barely scraping by with day to day work loading and unloading on the docks.  He eventually gets an opportunity to have another fight and the movie really gains momentum from there.  He keeps winning unexpectedly in bouts against opponents who are likely to whip him.  During this unlikely comeback, he finally gets a title shot against World Heavyweight Champion Max Baer, who has killed two opponents in the ring.  Although the first part of the movie may be a bit slow, it really gains momentum as it goes along.  It paints the grimness of the Great Depression in a very depressing and realistic way.  Part of the plot is way over the top (as is so typical and predictable in movies).  In this one, Max Baer is presented as a killing machine who enjoys hurting people.  My brief research of him revealed that he actually gave purses from some of his fights to the family of a fighter he had accidentally killed.  I also learned that he had a Star of David embroidered on his trunks when fighting German Max Baer during the Nazi heyday.  That didn't make him sound like the rotten scoundrel that Director Ron Howard tried to portray.  As is so typical of Hollywood, the ruling elite can't settle on the truth.  That isn't interesting enough for them evidently.  Nevertheless, this is a very good film portraying a classic American rags to riches story.  I highly recommend it.
