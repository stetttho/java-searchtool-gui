 This is a fun tale of a young boy who is dropped off for the summer at the home of his two great uncles whom he has never met.  His mother had heard stories about her uncles having a fortune of ill gotten gain which she wants the young lad, Walter, to locate while she is supposedly attending court reporting school.  The eccentric old uncles Garth and Hub (played by Michael Caine and Robert Duvall) are no more pleased about the idea of Walter spending the summer than he is.   They live in a shack and entertain themselves by shooting at traveling salesmen, assembling and flying old biplanes, and other unusual pasttimes.  When Walter sees Hub sleepwalking and reliving sword fights (with a toilet plunger), he asks Garth about it.  The tamer of the two uncles recounts how they had been forced into the French Foreign Legion as young lads and lived a life of wild adventures.  Walter doesn't know whether to believe the stories or not.  Eventually, Walter's mother returns to get him (and hopefully the money) with her no-good, abusive boyfriend.  Walter ends up having to decide with whom he wants to live.  This was a surprisingly good movie.  It is really appropriate for family viewing and is the type of show that is entertaining to all, regardless of age or gender.
