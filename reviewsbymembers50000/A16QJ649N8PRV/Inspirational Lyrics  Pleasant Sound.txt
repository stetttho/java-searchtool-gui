 FFH really does a great job in composing lyrically solid songs.  Their music is certainly focused on Jesus.    The sound is one that is very light.  They have several very good tracks on this CD.  I particularly like 'You Found Me' and 'Ready to Fly'.  'It's A Good Day' is also a very catchy tune.    I generally prefer something with a bit more oomph, but this is a nice sound.  My daughter is very fond of FFH so their sound can certainly be a draw for teens as well.
