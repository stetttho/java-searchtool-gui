 Third Day has once again put together an album that is terrific musically as well as having solid Christian lyrics.  This album really speaks to those who are struggling with issues in life (everyone).  It does so in a positive way that focuses on the solution to every problem - Jesus.  There are several good songs on this album and no bad ones.  There are three real standout songs in my opinion.  'Cry Out To Jesus' has received a lot of airplay on the radio.  It speaks to those who are dealing with death, troubled marriages, loneliness, and the other struggles of this life.  It provides a solution:  Cry out to Jesus.  'Tunnel' is a very energetic song relating that there is light at the end of this tunnel.  Finally, 'Communion' is a powerful song that portrays the power of this remembrance of the Savior of the World with a great modern sound.  As with virtually anything recorded by Third Day, I highly recommend this CD.
