 Learning to Breathe is a very enjoyable album.  It contains some very interesting and good music along with good vocals and positive lyrics.  The words in this CD are definitely focused on the Creator of the Universe.   Here are some examples of lyrics:  Learning to Breathe - I'm finding that You and You alone can break my fall.  You Already Take Me There - You meet me where I am, forgive me where I am.  Love Is The Moment - Why God gave His life to put motion inside my soul.  It's bigger than cold religion.  It's bigger than life.  There are really no bad songs in this collection.  Two that are real standouts are Dare You To Move and Learning To Breathe.  If you like Christian music, this is a good album to get.  If you like Switchfoot, it is a must have.  If you are not in either of the above categories, I'd recommend it anyway.  It is a very creative effort and you will likely enjoy it.
