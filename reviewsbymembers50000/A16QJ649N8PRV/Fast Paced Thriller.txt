 This is an exciting, fast paced thriller.   It begins with a kamikaze type attack on the motorcade of the president of the United States. Along with that there are other major terrorist threats occurring.  The story is a bit outdated now due to world events of the last couple of years. Nevertheless, it is a great concept with tons of action.  There were a few implausible elements in the story. One thing that didn't make much sense to me was an attack on the former director the Mossad. I didn't really see the point in attacking someone who was no longer in a position of power.  But, of course, terrorists are not rational.  Additionally, there were a couple of technical areas where a bit more research by the author would have been good. These were not things that took away from the story line a great deal, but Rosenberg is not on a par with Clancy in providing realistic details yet.  I haven't read any of Rosenberg's other books, but I will certainly be reading 'The Last Days' which is the sequel to this one. This is an exciting book and I highly recommend it.
