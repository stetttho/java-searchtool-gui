 David Baldacci is certainly one of the better authors of thrillers.   I have read most of his books and they are outstanding as a rule.  This one is very good, but it is not in a class with most of his previous efforts.  It starts off strongly with a pair of investigators, Sean King and Michelle Maxwell, working to prove that their client did not commit a burglary with which he has been charged.  During the course of their investigation they get entwined with a serial murder spree that has some connections to the burglary.  Soon they are deputized and thoroughly involved in attempting to solve the series of murders.  There is a lot of action in this story and it is well done for the most part.  There were some unbelievable parts, however.  In one scene, two bullets collided in mid air, thus sparing their intended targets and creating a mini fireworks show.  Another story line that didn't work involved King and Maxwell being involved in relationships that mirrored each other too much in an unbelievable way.  I hesitate to elaborate on that as I don't want to risk spoiling part of the story line.  Overall, I would say that it is a story that will keep the reader entertained and is worth the time.
