 Shaun Groves is a very talented soft rock artist.  His lyrics are Christian throughout.  His sound is very pleasant.  There are no bad songs on this CD.  There are several very good to excellent songs.  My favorites on this album are the following:  Move Me, After the Music Fades, Abba Father, and Welcome Home.  He wrote all of the songs on this album and his songwriting talents are top notch.  I highly recommend this CD for any Christian music fan.
