 This debut by Zoegirl is a pleasant collection of Christian pop.    The sound is a little lighter than I normally prefer, but they have a knack for making a lighter pop sound very pleasing.  In addition to that, their lyrics are very thoughtful, Christian, and solid.  My teenage daughter really enjoys Zoegirl, and I must say that I like them pretty well myself.  If you are looking for something to get for a teenager, this would be a particularly good pick.
