 Max Lucado has written a book to challenge Christians to adhere to II Chron. 7:14.  It is very simple, but well done.  In contrast to what one reviewer wrote, this has nothing to do with being divisive.  It is not written for the population at large.  It is written to Christians specifically letting them know what God has said that they need to do in their own lives to turn things around in our nation.  Mr. Lucado goes through II Chron. 7:14 phrase by phrase.  The text of that Scripture is as follows:  "If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land."  The solution found in this single verse is really quite simple.  Christians need to do the following:  1)  Acknowledge God, the Creator of the Universe, and his dominion;  2)  Pray; 3) Seek His face - Read His word, worship Him, etc.; 4)  Confess our sins and ask for forgiveness.  The simplicity of the verse is amazing.  The book is well done.   I highly recommend it to Christians.
