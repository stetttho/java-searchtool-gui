 This is really an impressive album both in terms of lyrics and musical quality.  The group has a well honed rock sound with strong lyrics and some excellent harmonies.  Even though the sound is really good, it takes a back seat to the lyrics.  As a parent of a teenage daughter, I couldn't ask for better music lyrically.  The message is a strong, Christian one that addresses issues that are very relevant to young people today - especially young women.  If you are are a parent and are looking for a good CD to buy your daughter, get this one.  You will not regret it.  If you are a teenage girl, you will love it.  The sound is far superior to most mainstream pop.  Also, you will be thinking about positive things.  I highly recommend this.
