 This was my first exposure to Brad Stine.  It was a real pleasure.  Like all good comedians, Stine can take virtually any routine situation and turn it into a joke.  The main difference is that Stine is able to get laughs without foul language, which is such a rarity these days.  He is also very open about being Christian and conservative.  He is a fan of America, not an America basher.  He has very funny routines on items ranging from airline security to toilet seats to the naming of the animals by Adam and Eve.  He also does a bit challenging political correctness and its anti free speech nature.  I recommend this routine.  I look forward to seeing some more of Stine's work.
