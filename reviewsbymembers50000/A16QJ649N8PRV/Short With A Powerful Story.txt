 I haven't read any of Ted Dekker's 'Martyr's Song' series previously.  I definitely will do so now though.  This is a story that is set in two different time periods. Part of it is set in Bosnia during WWII and part of it is 20 years later relating the events of the earlier period to a young girl who is struggling with being tormented by high school peers.  The Bosnia part is a portrayal of Christian martyrdom that is both painful and beautiful.  The 1960s part is both of those as well and contains some powerful truths that the girl can relate to her life to help her understand what is really important and enduring.  I think this book would be a great gift for any young girl who is struggling with the issues mentioned above.  I also think it is a good read in general.  For me, it was kind of a teaser.  It whetted my appetite to read the other books in this series.  I recommend it.
