 Michael Reagan writes from a child's perspective here.  He details traumas that he suffered as a child including adoption, molestation, the divorce of his parents, and boarding school.  Although he is in his 50s now, he is still affected by childhood events, particularly the molestation.  During the course of his life he has engaged in high risk behaviors and had suicidal thoughts stemming from his experiences.  It took decades, but he finally found redemption through his relationship with Christ.  His wife was a major player in helping him overcome this as well.  This book would be good to read for those who have experienced some of the issues mentioned above.  Additionally, I think it would help to provide great insights for adoptive parents, all parents, and those who work with children.  I also recommend it for anyone who likes to read an inspirational story of the redemptive power of Jesus in one's life.
