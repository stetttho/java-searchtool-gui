 Billy Wiles is a run of the mill bartender.  Upon leaving work one night, he finds a note on his SUV that says:  "If you don't take this note to the police and get them involved, I will kill a lovely blond schoolteacher somewhere in Napa County.  If you do take this note to the police, I will instead kill an elderly woman active in charity work.  You have six hours to decide.  The choice is yours."  Wiles shares the note with his buddy who is a deputy sheriff.  They both view the note as a sick joke.  The deputy, Lanny Olsen, does not share the note with anyone in his department.  After the first victim is killed, Olsen and Wiles both realize that their failure to officially report the threat has gotten them in a bind.  The action just escalates from this point.  There are more notes, more victims, and lots of action and suspense.  My only criticism is that the ending is a bit anticlimactic.  Even that is not a huge problem with this book as the rest of it is so captivating.  This book will not disappoint those who are looking for a fast paced thriller.  I recommend it.
