 I bought this CD for my daughter.  Although it really wasn't for me, I have to say that it's pretty good.  The only song that I had ever heard before it 'We Live'.  It is a very catchy tune with great lyrics.  There are some other songs that I really enjoyed also.  'Beauty From Pain', 'Anthem', and 'Pure' are some of the better songs on the album.  The music is really geared for teenagers and young adults.  It is especially appealing for young girls. This is good, clean rock with a positive message.    A couple of the issues that are addressed in their songs are bad relationships and eating disorders.  There is a subtle Christian message in some of the songs also.  If you want to find a good CD to give a teenage girl, this is a good pick.  It is one that the parents may just enjoy a bit also.
