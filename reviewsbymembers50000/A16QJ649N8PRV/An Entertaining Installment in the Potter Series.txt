 Volume Six in the Harry Potter series is an entertaining read for fans of the series.   Those who have read the previous Potter books will likely enjoy this one.  It is not as well done as some of the other books.  There are some plot lines that are nonsensical.  For instance:  Dumbledore, who is supposed to be so wise and discerning fails to see what any semi astute reader or character in the series should be able to see about one of the darker characters.  To avoid spoiling the plot, I won't go further on this point.  Suffice it to say, it will be crystal clear to readers well before the end of this book and was probably evident somewhere in book one.  Although it is a pleasant read for those who have read the series from the beginning, it is not done well enough to be a stand alone volume.  Those who have not read the previous installments will be lost by the lack of explanations of events.  The best thing about 'The Half Blood Prince' is the setup for the next book.  There are certainly several plots left open for follow up in book seven.  Readers who have enjoyed the whole series up to this point will likely enjoy this.  Those who have not read the others should start at the beginning and not jump right into this one.
