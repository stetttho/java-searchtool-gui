 This is an action packed thriller that combines the supernatural, a spiritual oddyssey or two, and lots of action.  The way that Wilson weaves the spiritual warfare into his plot is reminiscent of Frank Peretti.  Some of the dark, bizarre parts are a bit like Koontz.  Dark to Mortal Eyes is anything but predictable.  It takes several twists and turns that are totally unexpected.  It is so well done that I am quite surprised that it is just Wilson's first novel.  I certainly hope that he continues to write as he is obviously a major talent.
