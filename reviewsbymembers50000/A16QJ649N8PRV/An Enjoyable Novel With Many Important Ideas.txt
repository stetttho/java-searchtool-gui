 'The Ishbane Conspiracy' is a great combination; it is a highly entertaining novel that contains many important ideas and food for thought.  I would recommend it for any adult or teenager.  The authors did a great job of combining a Christian worldview and spiritual truths with a great story.  This is a sequel to 'Lord Foulgrin's Letters', which I would also recommend.  I think this is fine as a stand alone book though.  I don't think it is necessary to have first read its predecessor.  Along the way, the authors touch on many very relevant issues to young people - teen pregnancy, abortion, drugs, alcohol, the occult, etc.  This is done in a way that is very loving to those struggling with these issues.    This is a great book.  I highly recommend it.
