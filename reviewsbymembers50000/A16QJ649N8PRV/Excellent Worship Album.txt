 This worship album was my first exposure to Kutless.  What a pleasure!  This is a superb collection.  Although several of the songs are remakes of worship classics done by others, they are very well done.  Of those that had been done before, I particularly liked 'We Fall Down', 'Better Is One Day', and 'Arms of Love'.    An original Kutless song on this album is the title track, 'Strong Tower'.  It is a strong praise song that has inspiring lyrics and a great sound.  I liked this album so much that I decided to also pick up 'Sea of Faces' by Kutless and found it to be very good as well.  If you like worship music with a modern sound, get this album.  You won't regret it.
