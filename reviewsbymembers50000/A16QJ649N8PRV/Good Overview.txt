 This is very good for its intended purpose - a basic overview of introductory psychology.    It covers a wide range of topics including the following:  The physical structure of the brain, the effect of genetics on the brain, human development, reinforcement/extinction, the senses, memory, motivation, normal/abnormal psychology basics, and psychotropic drugs.  Within the parameters stated above, I would recommend this book.
