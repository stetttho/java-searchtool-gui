 'War' is a very good collection by U2.   This album is definitely focused on the Irish-British conflict and makes many powerful statements.  The music is strong vocally and instrumentally.  The guitars and drums are a major force on this CD.  There are two all time classics on this album - 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' and 'New Year's Day'.  The version of 'New Year's Day' on this album is quite a bit longer than the one on the 'The Best of 1980-1990' album.  I would recommend this album for that song alone.  If you enjoy classic rock, this is definitely a good one to have.
