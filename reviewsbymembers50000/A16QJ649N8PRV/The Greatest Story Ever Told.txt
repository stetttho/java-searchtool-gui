 This is a quality biography of the Savior of the Universe, Jesus Christ.  The author draws on accounts from all four Gospels.  He combines miracles, parables, and the entire life of Jesus from birth to death to resurrection.   The contents will be very familiar to those who have done lots of reading in the Bible.  Even to those readers though, this book is valuable.  There are lots of teachings and events that are put into the context of the times in which the Lord lived on Earth.  Mr. Anderson also gives explanations of several of the parables, which may be helpful to many readers.  This is a very readable, enjoyable, and informative work on the most important and influential man who ever lived.  I recommend it.
