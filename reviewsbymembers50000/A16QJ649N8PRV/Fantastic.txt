 I had only heard two of Ginny's songs until recently - 'Free' and 'If You Want Me To.'  I don't know why I hadn't ever bought one of her albums previously as those songs are very meaningful and sound great.  Recently I had the opportunity to hear her perform live when she warmed up for Jeremy Camp.  To say I was impressed with her music would be an understatement.  I hadn't known that she is blind and has been since a very young age.  Hearing her sing 'Be Thou My Vision' live while seeing that she is blind really impressed me with the way she deals with and views her disability.  She certainly has the big picture in mind.  Also, her fantastic song 'If you Want Me To' took on a whole new meaning.    Some of the lyrics from that song are:  'I don't know the reason why you brought me here, but just because you love me the way that you do, I'm gonna walk through the valley if you want me to.'  She goes on to sing: 'It may not be the way I would have chosen when you lead me through a world that's not my home, but you never said it would be easy, you only said I'll never go alone.'  After hearing her in concert, I picked up this CD and was hooked.  Her other songs have equally touching and relevant lyrics.  Her sound is incredible.  You can be assured that I will be buying some of her other CDs.  I would definitely recommend this one.  I don't think anyone would be disappointed.
