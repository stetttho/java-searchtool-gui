 I had never heard of this book or author before.  I just happened to run across it and decided to check it out.  It turned out to be a pretty good find.  The story features a Boston reporter, Jack Flynn, who gets involved in a wide range of happenings including the following:  the murder of his publisher, the suspicious death of the previous publisher of his paper, the alleged false reporting of one of his colleagues, and the nomination of his state's governor to be the U.S. Attorney General.  Brian McGrory wove these various elements into a well done thriller.  One annoyance I encountered was the author's propensity to switch between first and third person during the course of the story.  It wasn't a major distraction, but is an area that he might want to work on in future works.  I would recommend this.  It will keep the reader's attention engaged quite well.
