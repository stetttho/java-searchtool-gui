 Stephen Hayes does a solid job of documenting links between the Saddam Hussein and various terrorist groups including al Qaeda.  There is no smoking gun contained in these pages linking the former Iraq regime to the 9/11 attacks.  Of course, the Bush administration never claimed that there was.  What it does contain is a lot of evidence linking Hussein to various international terrorist groups.  In a post 9/11 world, the question becomes this:  Would any responsible administration ignore strong ties between a brutal thug like Hussein who regularly threatened U.S. interests and various terrorist organizations who routinely threaten the U.S.  The author certainly does a good job at documenting links between the Hussein regime with al Qaeda.  The thing that he does even better is proving the blatantly partisan nature of the establishment news media.  He also does a strong job of showing the way that various politicians have changed their position on the major issue in this book depending upon who is in the White House.  Many politicians including Bill Clinton, John Kerry, the French Foreign Minister and the UN Weapons Inspectors made statements linking Hussein to WMDs.  Then, when there is a president in the White House whom they despise, they change their tunes and claim that the WMD issue was phony.    Those who are strongly anti Bush may simply discard the author's case.  Those who are open minded will see that the administration did have some significant reasons to make the case against Iraq.
