 As is the norm with albums done by Third Day, this one is superb.  This has a definite rock flavor in comparison to their worship albums.  The lyrics continue to be meaningful.  The sound is top notch.  Their musical abilities are amazing and Mac Powell's voice is incredible.  This is a great CD for any fan of Christian music.  It is also one that any rock fan can enjoy.  Some of the really great tracks on this are as follows:  Come On Back to Me, 'Til the Day I Die, Wire, and Blind.    I would definitely recommend this.
