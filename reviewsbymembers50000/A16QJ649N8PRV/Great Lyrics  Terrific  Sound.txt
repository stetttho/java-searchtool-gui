 This is another great album in the tradition of Rebecca St. James.    She has combined deeply spiritual lyrics with a great sound.  Rebecca certainly has an amazing voice and it delivers a sonic delight with this collection.  There are several standout songs.  I particularly like Shadowlands, Take All of Me, and Love Being Loved By You.  The lyrics on a couple of the songs are incredibly moving.  One other song that really deserves special notice is 'Beautiful Stranger' which is a tribute to the great work done by Compassion International.  I would recommend this song, this album, and helping Compassion by donating money or sponsoring a child.
