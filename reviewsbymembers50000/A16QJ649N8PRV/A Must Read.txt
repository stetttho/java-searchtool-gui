 This is one of the most important books that I have ever read.  The Making of America contains some history leading up to the Constitution.  The most important and unique part of the book is a dissection of the Constitution principle by principle.    The author goes through 286 separate principles in the Constitution.  If you read this book, you will understand the U.S. Constitution better than 99% of the 'constitutional lawyers' claiming to be experts.  This is a book that every elected official and every American voter should read and study.
