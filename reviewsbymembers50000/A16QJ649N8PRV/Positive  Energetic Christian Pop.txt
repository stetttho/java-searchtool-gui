 This is a collection of Zoegirl's greatest hits along with two new songs.  It has a great sound and a solid Christian message throughout.  There are no bad songs in this collection and plenty of very good ones.  It is a must have for any fan of Zoegirl who doesn't have all of their albums.  I would also recommend it for anyone who hasn't heard them before.  They have an energetic, positive girl group sound.  Some of the tracks that I particularly like on this include the following:  With All of My Heart, I Believe, You Got Me, About You, Beautiful Name, and Scream.    This is a group that really relates to teenage girls and their problems.  The song 'Plain' is one that gives an inspirational message to any young girl who doesn't feel beautiful by societal standards.  Give it a try.  This is a keeper.
