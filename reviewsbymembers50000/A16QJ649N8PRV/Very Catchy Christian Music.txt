 Prior to buying this CD, the only song that I had heard from it was 'Next Thing You Know'.  That song is very catchy and appealing to a wide variety of age groups.  My teenage daughter likes it as much or more as I do.  After listening to the entire CD, I was very impressed.  It is definitely not just a one hit album.  Matthew West has lyrics that definitely speak to Christians.  For example, here is a bit from the song 'Only Grace':    "There is no guilt here.  There is no shame.  No pointing fingers.  There is no blame.  What happened yesterday has disappeared.  The dirt has washed away and now it's clear.  There's only grace.  There's only love.  There's only mercy.  And believe me, it's enough.  Your sins are gone without a trace."  Not only does he have solid lyrics, he has a very pleasing light rock sound.  I recommend this for any Christian music fan who is looking for something new and a bit different.
