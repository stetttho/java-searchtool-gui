 This is a solid effort at exploring the question:  Is the visible world around us all there is?  It is a valuable work that is well worth reading.  Yancey does a good job of addressing doubts and questions about the existence of and faith in the spiritual realm.  He helps one to consider and evaluate these issues by posing questions and then some answers.  This is done in a converational manner by one who has evidently had significant doubts/questions about his own faith and resolved those along the way.  Although not a book that is so engrossing that it is difficult to put down, it is enjoyable and thought provoking.
