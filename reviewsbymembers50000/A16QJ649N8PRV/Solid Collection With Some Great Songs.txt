 I hadn't really been too familiar with the music of Geoff Moore and The Distance until fairly recently.  A couple of months ago I attended a concert featuring several different performers where Geoff was the MC.   He also sang a few songs.  He made a very positive impression on me with his presentation so I decided to check out his music a bit more.  I bought this CD and really like it.  He has some great songs on here.  One of my favorites is 'Good To Be Alive'.  The positive message in that song is a real delight to hear.  Another great one is "Evolution ... Redefined."  It is funny, sounds great, and has a solid message.  'Best Days' and 'Listen To Our Hearts' are two other standout selections.  I recommend this album.
