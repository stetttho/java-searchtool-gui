 Dave Ramsey's book teaches the kind of information that should be taught to kids in school, but isn't.    If you are one of the great multitude of Americans who has heavy debt and little savings, you should buy this book and follow Ramsey's advice.  He gives a solid plan on how to get out of debt and accumulate wealth.  Besides giving great advice, Ramsey gives many examples of people who have turned their financial lives around using these principles.   It is an easy read and packed with great advice.  I would highly recommend that you buy this book!
