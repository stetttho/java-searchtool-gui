 As with anything that Rebecca St. James does, this collection is excellent.  She has a superb mix of worship songs on this live CD.  In addition to the listed songs, there is a hidden track of 'Shout to the Lord' so don't stop the last song too soon.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have a lot of songs.  I would have loved to have heard a few more.  Excluding that mild problem, this is very good.  I would recommend it.
