 Dead Line is a decent novel.  It is not great and not very original.  The hero in this book is a reporter, Jack Flynn.  He is not a particularly credible hero who is in a story that is pretty much run of the mill.  I bought this in a bargain book bin, for which I was thankful.  I would not have been too happy had I paid full price for this hardback.  It is much more suited to pick up as a used paperback.  Mr. McGrory is clearly a good writer.  The book is well written; it is just not particularly interesting or exciting.  Although billed as a thriller, I would say that description is overly generous.  If you are interested in a fast paced, exciting novel, I would not recommend putting this book at the top of your list.
