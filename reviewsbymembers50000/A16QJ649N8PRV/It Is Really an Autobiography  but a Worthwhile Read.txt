 This is really an autobiography of Tim Russert.  That is not necessarily a bad thing; it just seems like the hype for the book doesn't really make that clear.  Although I thought it started off a bit slow, I enjoyed it more and more as I went along.  Part of that was nostalgia.  Russert takes us back to a more relaxed and kinder time in our history for most of the book.  The author's father, Big Russ, is a typical middle class American from the WWII generation - hardworking, loyal, patriotic.  He obviously had a big impact on his son's life, which is a very positive thing for the most part.  Russert has generally struck me as a fairly balanced reporter, which is a real rarity among the major network news people.  His book shows that he comes from the liberal perspective that is rare these days; he is a liberal without the 'blame America first' mindset.    He has some wise comments on perspective.  One of them is: "The older I get, the smarter my father seems to get."  He talks with admiration about his father's generation - the group who beat the Germans and Japanese in WWII:  "They didn't talk about it, they just did it."    Another good observation was about current child rearing methods:  "I believe that parents of my generation have often failed our kids.  We are so eager to be understanding and sympathetic that we end up being too lenient, even as we further undermine the already diminished authority of teachers, coaches and principles."    One of his most revealing comments contrasted his political hero, Bobby Kennedy, with liberals of today:  "But with Kennedy, unlike some of the liberals who followed him, the message was never about blaming America.  He insisted that we were a great country, but that we could do better."  Russert reviews several life lessons that are good including sections on respect, faith, work, fatherhood, and discipline.  Perhaps the best section was on loss (death).  This may not be a great book, but it is a worthwhile one.
