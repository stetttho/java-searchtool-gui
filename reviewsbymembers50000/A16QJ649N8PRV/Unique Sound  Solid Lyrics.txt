 This album is full of worshipful Christian lyrics combined with a sound that is very catchy.  The David Crowder Band has one of those sounds that continues to grow on you the more you listen to their music.  It is very creative and very different.  There are several very good songs on this album and none that are bad.  It is well worth a listen.
