 This is a good sampler of U2's earlier work.  It is not complete enough to satisfy a hard core fan, but it probably doesn't need to do so.  Those fans probably already own several of the earlier albums.  This really should have probably been a two disk compilation.  At least two of the great songs were shortened on this version:  'New Year's Day' and 'Where the Streets Have No Name'.  There are also some songs that were not included at all.  In fact, there were no cuts from 'October' which was an excellent album.  This isn't a bad start to a U2 collection.  However, if you like them, you will undoubtedly want more.
