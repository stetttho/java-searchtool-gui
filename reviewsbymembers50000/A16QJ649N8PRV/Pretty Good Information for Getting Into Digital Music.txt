 This is a pretty good reference book for anyone who is just getting into digital music.    It is particularly focused on the Windows Media player.  There is also useful information regarding ripping and burning CDs, creating a computer jukebox, portable music players such as IPods, etc.  The author also discusses the different formats for storing/playing digital music and the online services that offer downloadable songs for each.  Overall, I would say it is pretty good as far as being a beginning resource for one's digital music needs.
