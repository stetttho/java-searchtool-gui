 This is a fast paced thriller that has much to offer.  It is not a good stand alone book though.  I first read this book about six months ago and found it to be pretty mediocre.  I had heard good things about this series so decided to give the author another try.    When I did so, I started back with 'Rain Fall'.  It is the first book in the series.  I really enjoyed it, so I decided to give 'Hard Rain' another try.  This time I found it to be very good.  The difference in my two times through this book is that 'Hard Rain' is not written in a style that is good for someone who hasn't already read the first book in the series.  There are far too many passing references to situations in 'Rain Fall'.  There are also entirely too many parts of the central characters that were developed in the previous book that are not reiterated in this one well enough to be understandable without the background.  Although some authors are great at going through critical elements of previous books so new readers aren't at a disadvantage (W.E.B. Griffin comes to mind), Mr. Eisler is not there yet.    I recommend this book only for those who have already read 'Rain Fall' and enjoyed it.  If you haven't done that, I suggest skipping this one.
