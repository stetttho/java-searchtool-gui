 Les Miserables is one of the truly great classics of literature.  It is one that should really be read by everyone.  This epic contains great characters involved in a superb story.  It contains battles of good vs. evil and has heroes and villains.  The unabridged version is long, but well worth it.  Hugo does have some long dissertations that drag a bit at times, but overall they are just a small part of a great whole.  Some of the events are really implausible in the way that characters encounter each other in circumstances that are extremely coincidental.  However, Hugo's story and writing are so compelling that these incidents don't take away from a great story.    If you are interested in reading this, but aren't quite ready to take on such a lengthy novel, you may want to watch the film version featuring Liam Neeson.  It is very well done and is enough to whet the appetite.  Just don't make the mistake of stopping with the movie or you will miss something very special.
