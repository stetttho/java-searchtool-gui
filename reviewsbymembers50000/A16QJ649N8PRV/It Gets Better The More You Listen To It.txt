 The first time that I listened to this CD, I thought it was ok with a couple of very interesting songs.  After listening to it a few more times, I think it is really quite amazing.  This is definitely an album ... not just a collection of songs.  It is broken into different parts that are all theme based.   The songs are full of lyrics praising the Creator of the Universe.  They are done in an interesting and compelling way that will grab you if you give it a chance.  I would highly recommend that you buy this album and listen to it, and listen to it some more, and listen to it some more.  You won't regret it.
