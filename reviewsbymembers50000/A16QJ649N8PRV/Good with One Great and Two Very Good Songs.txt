 This album has a very mellow sound.  It is perhaps a bit mellower than I prefer.  Most of the songs are fairly good.  The lyrics are filled with praise and the vocals are good.  There is one song that is really excellent.  'Indescribable' is a superb song praising the Creator of the Universe.  There are two other very good praise songs - 'Holy is the Lord' and 'How Great Is our God'.  The rest of the songs are good, but not really my preference in music.  Those three songs make the album.  I think it is worth the price even if it just for those first three songs.
