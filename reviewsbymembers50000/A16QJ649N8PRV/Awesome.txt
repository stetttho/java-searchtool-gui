 This collection of greatest hits is an amazing album!   Few groups can compare to DC Talk in terms of the diversity of the types of songs that they can perform well. Their vocals are superb. On top of that, they feature lyrics that are powerful and uncompromising.   This album is a must have for anyone who loves rock music and/or Christian music. For anyone who is not yet a fan of this amazing group, you are missing something very special.  I think that listening to this could certainly change that.   Although their solo works are pretty good, these three have an amazing chemistry when they are together that is hard to match.  In addition to this, I would certainly recommend their albums 'Jesus Freak', 'Welcome to the Freak Show', and 'Supernatural' in particular.
