 Condi Rice is a highly impressive person and perhaps the most powerful woman in the world currently.  She is a very worthy subject of a good biography.  Unfortunately, this book by Antonia Felix is not it.  This is little more than a 240 page resume for Dr. Rice that could have been compiled by almost anyone.  It is a "biography" that lacks even an interview with the subject herself as a source.  It is frankly a substandard effort.  Ms. Felix did an adequate job of outlining several major parts of Dr. Rice's history including the following:  Her formative years in segregated Birmingham, her college years, her years working in academia, and her governmental service.  Although those elements are interesting and show what a highly accomplished person Dr. Rice is, the book does not really show us the person.  The author addressed the significant impact that Dr. Rice's parents had in her life, but she barely mentions any other person who has been influential with the exception of one college professor at the University of Denver.    This work also does little to address the ideas, philosophy, and policy views of the Secretary of State.  This seems like a very odd ommission given that she is often mentioned as a possible presidential candidate.  The only policy position that was given more than a passing reference is her opposition to gun control (developed during troubling years in the South where racist local politicians ran roughshod over Black Americans).  One hopes that some author will do a proper biography on this highly accomplished and very impressive woman.
