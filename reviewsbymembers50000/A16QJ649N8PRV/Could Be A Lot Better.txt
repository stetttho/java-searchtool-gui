 This is an album with several good songs on it.  I just don't think that they were done as well as they could have been.  The sound is pretty slow and lacking energy.  If you're worshipping the Creator of the Universe, you should have a lot more power in your singing.  There were a couple of songs that were very well done here.  I particularly like 'Above All'.    If you are looking for a worship album with a lot of energy, I would recommend getting one by Third Day or the Newsboys.
