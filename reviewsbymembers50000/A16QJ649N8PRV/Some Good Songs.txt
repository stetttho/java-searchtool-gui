 This CD is like most of the solo efforts of the DC Talk members.  It is good, but not anything outstanding.   Michael Tait along with Kevin Max and Toby Mac had an amazing thing going with DC Talk.  It was a rarely equalled group that was head and shoulders above virtually any other group out there past or present.  In contrast, as solo artists, the three are pretty good.    Tait has some solid Christian lyrics.  One of his songs, 'Lose This Life', is very good.  The others range from ok to pretty good.
