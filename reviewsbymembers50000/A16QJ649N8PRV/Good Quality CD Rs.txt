 I have had very good success with the Verbatim CD-Rs.    Before using these, I had bought some of another well known brand.  The others did not work well at all for me.  I had a failure rate of over 50%.  With the Verbatim brand, I have not had any that failed out of about 75 tried.  I would say that this particular media is a very good product based upon my experience.
