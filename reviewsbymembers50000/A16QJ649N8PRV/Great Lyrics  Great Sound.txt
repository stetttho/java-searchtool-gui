 This has a very enjoyable sound with solid lyrics.  I recommend it.  I am not a big hard rock fan, but this is good stuff.  It is not so hard that the lyrics are undecipherable as is the case with so many hard rock groups.  It is not only possible to understand the lyrics, but they are positive and powerful.  There are a few mellower songs on this album and even an excellent praise and worship song, "All The Words".    Any fan of harder rock will probably really enjoy this CD.  Even those of us who are not hard rockers can appreciate it.  If you have a teenager who likes harder rock, this would be a great CD to buy him/her.  The solid Christian lyrics combine with the music to make it a very good collection.
