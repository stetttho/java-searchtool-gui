 'Genesis' features Joy's great voice and lyrics.  This album has a few really good songs.  I particularly like 'Hide', 'Beautiful Redemption', 'Silence', and 'God Only Knows'.    Her songs feature lyrics that reflect issues that most of us experience.  'Silence' deals with praying and wondering if God is listening.  He is, but there are times when most of us wonder due to our own shortcomings.  Another one that has absolutely superb lyrics is 'Hide'.  It is very catchy and gets played fairly often on Christian radio.    Although there are a few songs that I think are just ok, the ones that are good make this album worth the cost.  I recommend it.
