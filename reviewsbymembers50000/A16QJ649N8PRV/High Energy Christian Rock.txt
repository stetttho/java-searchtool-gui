 This is a great collection by Audio Adrenaline.  It is a CD that really rocks.  There are a couple of mellower songs also.  Several of the songs have very good Christian lyrics.  Some of the songs are really excellent and very catchy.  I particularly like the following:  'Big House,' 'Hands and Feet', 'Man of God', and 'Underdog'.    If you like high energy rock with good Christian messages, this is a good choice.
