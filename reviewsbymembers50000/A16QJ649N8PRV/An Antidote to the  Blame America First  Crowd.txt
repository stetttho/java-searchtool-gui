 Former Georgia Governor and U.S. Senator Zell Miller explores the political climate and some problematic issues facing our nation currently.  He provides some much needed insight into these areas.  Although he discusses several issues here, the two primary things that he looks at are the Democrats' (he is one) wimpy response to terrorism and the increasing hostility toward religion in our society.   He does a great job at outlining some serious problem areas.  He also provides a few specific soutions.  One of his observations is:  "Today, at the same time young Americans are dying in the sands of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan, our nation is being torn apart and made weaker because of the Democrat's manic obsession to bring down our commander in chief."  Anyone who has observed the political climate over the last few years can tell that bashing George W. Bush and anything he does is the number one activity of partisan Democrats now.  Virtually every nominee he has proposed for a judgeship or any other position has been viciously attacked and had his/her character assassinated.  The only exception to that that I can think of since Bush took office is Colin Powell.    Miller compares this current ugly climate to the way Democrats and Republicans have stayed united during times of war.   He cites various examples of pro American wartime leadership of the past including Truman and FDR.  He contrasts these examples with the current crop of the 'Blame America first' crowd.  One other issue that he addresses very well it the 'Fair Tax' proposal which would eliminate countless hidden taxes and lower the amount taken from the taxpayers.  Miller is a class act.  His book has some much needed ideas and should be read by all.
