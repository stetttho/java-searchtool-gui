 By Order of the President is a great start to another military adventure series by WEB Griffin.   Already the master of military fiction, Griffin continues to add to his credentials as a great storyteller.  Unlike his other military tales, this one is set in current times, in fact just slightly (a few months) into the future.  It has some great new characters taking on terrorists who have stolen a 727 with intent to cause mayhem.  The lead player is Maj. Charley Castillo, who is as unconventional as other Griffin creations such as Killer McCoy.  For anyone who has read Griffin before and likes him, this is one that you won't want to miss.  If you haven't read him before, you don't know what you're missing and should definitely start.  You will find the journey a great pleasure.
