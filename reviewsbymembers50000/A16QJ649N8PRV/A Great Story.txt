 This book is basically a romance with a major lesson.  Had I known it was a romantic type book before starting it, I'm sure I would have passed on it as those have no interest for me.  That would have been a major mistake.   This is an excellent novel with a great message.  The story is primarily set in the United States in the 1960s.  It has some flashbacks to Bosnia in WWII.  The protagonist, Janjic Jovic, was a Yugoslav partisan during the war with a band that performed some horrific acts.  This was mostly due to the pushing of the leader, Karadzic, who was a major bad guy.  Jovic was heroic in challenging Karadzic over some of his atrocities.  He ended up being imprisoned for his valor.  Two decades later Jovic is a successful author in Atlanta who has written a bestselling account of events during the war including Kardzic's evils such as the martyrdom of a priest and a young girl who refused to renounce Christ.  This was a major life altering event for Jovic and many of his readers.  Jovic ends up becoming involved with Helen, who is a drug addict who is the sexual slave of a particularly evil man, Glenn Lutz.  The story has elements that seem utterly absurd on the face.  Jovic almost instantaneously develops an unconditional love for Helen who continues going back to Lutz for drugs in exchange for sexual favors.  Although few would continue to love and tolerate her in the face of her continual betrayals, Jovic does so with fervor.  On the surface, he appears to be the biggest schmuck on the planet.  However, Dekker does a masterful job of showing how we are Helen and Jovic represents Christ's love in the story.    To avoid spoiling the storyline, I will refrain from further commentary here.  I would highly recommend this book and encourage readers to really focus on the underlying message.  It is a great read.
