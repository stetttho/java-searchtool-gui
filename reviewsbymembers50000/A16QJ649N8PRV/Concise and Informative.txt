 This is a great reference for anyone who communicates in English.  This small book takes a subject that is generally dry and makes the most of it.  Reading a volume on the rules of usage and principles of composition is normally rather tedious.  In this compact guide, the authors educate readers in a rather painless way.    Most people would benefit from an occasional refresher in this area.  Even many professional writers would do much better if they absorbed some of the principles here.  There are some rules that seem pretty rigid.  Some of the rules don't seem very applicable any more due to evolution in the language.  Nevertheless, this is a valuable guide that will benefit anyone who reads it.
