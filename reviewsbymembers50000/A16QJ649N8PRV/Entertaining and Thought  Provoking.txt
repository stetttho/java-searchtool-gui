 The authors do an excellent job of challenging conventional 'wisdom' on a variety of subjects.  My only complaint with this book is that it is too short.   In spite of its relative brevity, it covers quite a bit of ground.  Some of the conclusions will likely aggravate those of virtually every philosophical perspective.  For example, liberals will probably be irked by the observation that swimming pools are far more dangerous than handguns when it comes to causes of death.  On the other hand, most conservatives will no doubt be irritated by the conclusion that the legalization of abortion in 1973 is what led to the huge decrease in crime in the 1990s.  The authors have some funny chapter titles such as:  " What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common?" and "How is the Ku Klux Klan Like a Group of Real Estate Agents?"  Amazingly enough, in spite of those odd sounding titles, the authors manage to answer the questions they pose.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wants a book that is both thought provoking and highly entertaining; Freakonomics is both.
