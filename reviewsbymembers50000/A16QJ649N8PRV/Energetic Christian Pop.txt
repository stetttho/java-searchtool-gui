 Zoegirl has come out with another album with some very good songs.  Their sound has changed a bit from their first album.  It has less of a dance sound to it.  I think the music has more substance to it.  The lyrics continue to be positive and have a Christian message throughout.  There are several very good songs.  Two of my favorites are 'Beautiful Name' and 'You Get Me'.    This is a pleasant album overall.  I recommend it for anyone wanting a gift for teenage girls.  They love the sound and the lyrics are very good.  This is an enjoyable album even for those of us who have teenage children.
