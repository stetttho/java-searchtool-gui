 I decided to read this book for a couple of reasons:  My wife had heard a lot of good things about it and I normally love books about Africa or set in Africa as I have spent quite a bit of time there.  Unfortunately what I found in this book was a poorly written, boring story with no plot.  I certainly don't get what so many people seem to see in this book.  Wilbur Smith it is not.  I certainly don't recommend it.
