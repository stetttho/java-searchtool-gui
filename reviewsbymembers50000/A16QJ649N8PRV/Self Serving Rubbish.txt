 It would be hard to imagine a poorer author for a children's book than Mr. Kennedy.  How ironic that the person who left a young woman to die in the waters of Chappaquidick would write a book with a dog named 'Splash'.  One wonders what would possess him to do such a thing.  The book itself is typical Teddy propaganda.  The story features efforts to pass a school finance bill.  As he does in real life, he lays out his simplistic solutions of throwing more money at the educational problem (and thus buy support from the teacher's union) even though many comparative studies show no correlation between dollars thrown at education and the results.  Perhaps Mr. Kennedy would have been better writing about something where his expertise would be relevant such as 'Advanced Drinking' or 'Hyper Hypocrisy'.
