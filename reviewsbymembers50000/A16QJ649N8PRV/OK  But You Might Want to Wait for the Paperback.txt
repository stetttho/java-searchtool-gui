   The Broker is an OK read in a new story type for Grisham. Like 'A Painted House' and 'Skipping Christmas' it is far removed from his legal thrillers of the early days.  This type of book is definitely not his strong suit.   Having written several great novels previously, expectations are set very high for him. In this one, he writes a pretty good story, but one with some flaws. I think that he really overdoes some parts of it such as the lessons on the Italian language and sites in Italy. If one is really into Italy, that might be a plus. For me, it took away from focusing on a story that could have had a lot more action and suspense.   If it had been written by an unknown author, I would have probably rated it as a good first outing. However, with a history like Grisham has, I would simply say that it is just an OK piece of fiction with some parts that are a bit tedious.   Although it was enjoyable, I would recommend waiting until it comes out in paperback.
