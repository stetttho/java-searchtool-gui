 This is an album full of solid, Scripturally based lyrics and rock music.  There are several good songs on this CD with two that are superb.  'King' is a catchy tune that is very well done.  The version of 'Blessed Be Your Name' done here is fantastic.  It has lots of guitar, lots of rocking, and lots of praise to the Creator of the Universe.  If these two songs were the only ones on the album, it would be well worth the price.  As a bonus, it contains several other enjoyable songs.  If you like praise music with lots of passion, this CD would be a good addition to your collection.
