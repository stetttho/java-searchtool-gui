 This is a great resource for parents of teenagers who are facing the difficult challenges of adolescence in today's world.  It is co-written from the perspectives of both the father of a rebellious teen and the former rebel herself (she is now an adult in nursing school).  There is an ongoing narrative telling about the struggles of Heather Stone starting at age 13,  as well as those of her parents, Charles and Sherryl.  Along with their encouraging story, there are nine 'relational life preservers' to help those with similar struggles.  There is a Christian perspective throughout this volume.  Charles is a pastor and Heather is a prodigal daughter who has returned to her roots.  Although I have been fortunate enough to avoid most of the extremely difficult situations that Charles and his wife faced with Heather, I recommend this book for any parent of a teenager.  Even parents of teens who are not totally rebellious face many trying times through the adolescent years.  The advice given will be helpful for any parent with teenagers.
