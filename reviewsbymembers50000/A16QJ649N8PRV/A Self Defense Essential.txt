 This book is an essential for anyone who is interested in the basics of self defense.    When Applegate wrote this, many Americans had the mindset that self protection had to be conducted with a gentlemanly approach.  Due to lessons learned in WWII (and that have certainly been magnified in recent years), he corrected that notion for readers of this book.  The section on defensive unarmed combat is excellent and timeless.  The methods of 'dirty fighting' are basic to one who is in a life and death struggle.  He addresses weaknesses of human anatomy and how to exploit them and has a number of great techniques for self defense.  The section on point shooting is also very good for those who carry a handgun for protection.  He does a great job of highlighting the weaknesses of target type shooting for handgun training for self defense/combat situations.  He has a solid section on point shooting.  There are large parts of the book that are dedicated to subjects that are not very applicable to readers who are not military or law enforcement types such as mob control, chemical munitions, and raiding techniques.  There are also parts that are quite outdated on subjects like body armor, specific weapons, holsters, etc.  In spite of all that, the sections on close combat are worth the price and could be valuable for anyone who finds himself/herself in an ugly situation with a criminal, etc.
