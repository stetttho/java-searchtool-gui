 This collection has lots of great hits from a wide variety of artists.  Out of the 30 songs included, there are only 2-3 that I don't really care for too much.  On the other hand, there are 25 + tunes that I think are excellent.    Artists on this CD include:  DC Talk, Newsboys, Jeremy Camp, Rebecca St. James, Nicole C. Mullen, Sonic Flood, Jennifer Knapp, and many more.  You can't go wrong with this album.  I highly recommend it.
