 Jeremy Camp has put together a very solid album of praise music.    He has a powerful voice that does a good job with this collection of songs.  Some of them are remakes of songs written by others.  Some are his originals.  This is a good purchase for anyone who wants a worship CD with lots of energy.  I particularly like his version of, "You Are Worthy of My Praise."    For anyone who doesn't have his other CDs, I would recommend getting them first.  His CDs "Stay" and "Restored" are two of the finest albums that I have ever heard.  This one is very good, but it is not nearly as strong as those two.
