 This debut by Casting Crowns is excellent.  It combines a strong message in the lyrics with great vocals and instrumentation.  The first song is "What If His People Prayed" which is a great reminder and challenge to Christians about a vital subject.  The next one is "If We Are The Body" which challenges us to get out and add action to faith in reaching people who are hurting.  "Here I Go Again" is another instant classic on this album with great sound and powerful words.  There are also several other top notch songs in this collection.  With a debut this good, I can hardly wait to see what comes next.
