 Night Fall is the first Nelson Demille novel that I have read and I found it to be very good.  It is based on the real life event.  On 17 July 1996, a Boeing 747, TWA Flight 800, departed New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport bound for Paris.   Approximately twelve minutes later, it exploded in mid air just off of Long Island.    Reports have indicated that at least 270 people supposedly witnessed objects streaking toward the aircraft.   FAA radar operators in New York also witnessed an unknown object `merging' with the aircraft just prior to the crash.  After an extensive investigation the government concluded that it was the result of a mechanical failure.  Demille's story features an FBI agent, Kate Mayfield, who is not satisfied with the official outcome.  Five years after the crash she attends an annual memorial service for the victims of Flight 800 with her husband, John Corey.  He is a former NYPD detective and currently working as a contract agent on the same anti terrorist task force as his wife.  Mayfield mentions some of her concerns to Corey.  Then, while they are at the memorial service, another FBI agent Liam Griffith warns Corey off.  This threat gets Corey very interested in the case and he starts looking into it.  During the course of the story, intense pressure is put on Corey to cease his extra curricular efforts.   In spite of all of it, he doggedly pursues the case.  In the latter part of the book, the action gets very intense.  It develops into a story that is hard to put down.  I thought that the ending was pretty weak,  however, the overall story is exciting and fast paced.  I would recommend it.
