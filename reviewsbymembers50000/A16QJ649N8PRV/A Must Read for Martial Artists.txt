 'Living the Martial Way' is a valuable book that should be read by serious martial artists.   The author explores a wide range of issues including the mental/'spiritual' aspects, history, philosophy, strategy/tactics, and many others.  This work is particularly valuable to those who do not have the good fortune to have an instructor who is a traditionalist.  Those martial artists who have such a teacher have undoubtedly gotten a dose of most of the best of this volume.  Those without such a mentor will doubly benefit from Morgan's instruction.  Here is the breakdown of this book as I see it:  The Good ---------------- 1.  Lots of interesting history. 2.  Excellent material on the ethical principles, loyalty, honor, etc. 3.  Philosophical roots of the martial arts. 4.  The benefits of training, particularly as it applies to seeking ecellence in other areas of one's life. 5.  A good section on strategy and tactics. 6.  Excellent commentary on internal vs. external motivations. 7.  A good response to religious based objections to martial arts training.  The Not So Good -------------------- 1.  Too much discussion of 'face' including some rationalization for inappropriate responses to a loss of face. 2.  Some discussion of revenge and suicide that should have been treated strictly as historical instead of some weak justification of these as applied to the modern world. 3.  The author is rather elitist in his view of warriors being superior to pretty much everyone else on the planet.  Although this part included some good observations, it was overdone.  Overall, I would recommend this book for any martial artist.  Additionally, I think that a lot of the information would be interesting and valuable even to non 'warriors'.
