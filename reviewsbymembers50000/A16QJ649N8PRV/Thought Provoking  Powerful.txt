 This is really two stories in one.  It is very good and well worth reading.  The author uses the same basic story with two very different endings that are based upon the actions, including prayer, of the protagonist, Richard Sullivan.  It shows a very powerful picture of how an individual can be affected by spiritual warfare and can have a major effect on the lives of others through prayer and other actions.  It does this while portraying a very realistic picture of the struggles faced by everone, including Christians, on a day to day basis.  Although the author may not be quite as polished as Frank Peretti, he is very good and writes in a similar way.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone and particularly to Christians.
