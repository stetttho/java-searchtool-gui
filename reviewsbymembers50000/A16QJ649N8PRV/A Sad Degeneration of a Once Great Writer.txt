 Maximum Ride is another one of the recent bizarre books by Patterson on the bird kid theme.  If you read `When the Wind Blows' or `The Lake House' and didn't like them, stay away from this book.  It is more of the same goofy writing.  Having really been a big fan of Mr. Patterson back when he was writing the Alex Cross novels, I am more than a bit disappointed with his writing as of late.  This one is the worst of the lot in my opinion.  For anyone who has missed the two books on this theme cited previously, they involve a group of `bird children' who are the result of genetic experimentation that grafted avian DNA into that of humans.  The resulting `creations' are super strong humans with wings.  They can fly, etc.  In this story, the `flock', as they call themselves, battle another group of mutants, created in the same lab, who are part wolf.  The wolf men are constantly trying to thwart the bird kids, but are defeated in totally implausible ways.  Some of the bird kids have now developed very unusual abilities:  The leader, Max (Maximum Ride) hears a voice of someone communicating with her to save the world.  One of the other ones can now breathe underwater and one can now `see' things that have occurred in a place simply by touching objects.  If Patterson is now trying to target the teen market, he should be advertising it that way.  There are others who do much better in that area, however, such as C.S. Lewis and J.K. Rowling.  If you are a Patterson fan from long ago, you might want to do yourself a favor and skip this one so you can remember him as the great writer that he once was.
