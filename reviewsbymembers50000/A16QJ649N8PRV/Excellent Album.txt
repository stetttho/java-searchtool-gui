 This is an excellent album by a very talented artist.   Her sound is superb.  She combines a folk and rock type sound with solid Christian lyrics.  It is all combined with her strong, throaty voice that is very unique.  If you are looking for a great sound with strong meaning, I certainly recommend Kansas.
