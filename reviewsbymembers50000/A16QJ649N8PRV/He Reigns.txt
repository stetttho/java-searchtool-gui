 Adoration is a terrific worship album.  It begins with 'He Reigns', which is not only a great song, but also summarizes what this collection is all about.  It is mainly composed of worship songs that are originals by The Newsboys.  There are a couple of songs that have been written by others, but most of them are new here.  This CD would be well worth the price even if the only song it contained was 'He Reigns', but it contains much more, most of which is very good.  If you love music that praises The King of Kings, this is one that you will surely enjoy.
