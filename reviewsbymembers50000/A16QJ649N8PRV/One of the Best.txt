 Atlas Shrugged is certainly one of the best novels that I have ever read.  It is highly entertaining and is well worth reading by all.  I first read it about 20 years ago and thought it was phenomenol.  I recently reread it and thoroughly enjoyed it again.  The basic story is about the thinkers and doers of the world going on strike when the fruits of their labors are confiscated (stolen) by the government and redistributed to those who don't produce.  It explores the free market vs. socialism, personal responsibility, and excellence in the entertaining medium of a great novel.  It is probably longer than it needs to be as Rand tended to be a bit repetitive and had some very long speeches in the text.  Nevertheless, those only reduce its appeal a slight amount.  I'm not an objectivist and disagree with parts of Rand's philosophy.  That being said, this work was certainly a great predictor of the future effects of socialism on the American and world economies.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in important ideas and/or entertaining novels.
