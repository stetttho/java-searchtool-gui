 Honeymoon features FBI Agent John O'Hara who is undercover attempting to make a case against Nora Sinclair whom he suspects of having murdered her fianc. In fact, he is convinced that she is a `black widow' and that this was not her only killing.   The story progresses with several interesting twists and turns throughout. There are surprises right up until the end.   It is certainly not on a par with some of Patterson's better novels such as 'Kiss the Girls' or 'Hide and Seek'.  However, it is a quick read that will keep the reader entertained the whole way.
