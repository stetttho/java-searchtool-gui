 This is a great collection of hymns.  It combines the best of both worlds - the depth of the old hymns with a contemporary sound.  Many young people have never been exposed to the old hymns as the focus is so much on contemporary music now.  I'm not complaining as I love the modern worship music.  However, compilations such as this one give younger listeners (and others who aren't familiar with them) a chance to become familiar with some of the great hymns of the faith.  Even a song such as 'Doxology' which I always considered pretty bland is given a great update here.  I really encourage this collection for anyone interested in praise music.  Even those who don't normally like the more modern music would love this I think.
