 This book provides a good overview of martial arts.  It is a particularly good book for someone who is just thinking about getting involved in martial arts training.  The author gives a brief introduction to a wide variety of styles and what to expect from each.  Ms. Lawler also gives very helpful information to a prospective or new martial artist on ranking systems, training routines, competition, and even some self defense basics.  I think that this book is even good for more experienced practitioners of the martial arts.  It covers a lot of interesting information on history and various tidbits on the martial arts culture and different styles.  It is definitely a worthwhile purchase.
