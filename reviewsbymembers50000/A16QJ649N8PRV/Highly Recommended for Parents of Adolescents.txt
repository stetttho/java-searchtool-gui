 This will likely benefit anyone who is a parent of an adolescent.  I think that it would also be helpful to adolescents themselves (if they would read it) in understanding some of their own behavior.  Walsh provides a lot of information on the latest research in brain development from adolescence to adulthood and its effects on attitudes, behavior, etc.  He also discusses hormonal changes as well as cultural and other influences that are helpful in understanding the teen years.  Along with the scientific research he provides, Dr. Walsh also compares parenting styles, discusses activities for kids that can help in the short and long term, and provides realistic ideas for parenting during these tumultuous years.   One of his particularly good suggestions is behavioral contracts.  He provides a couple of specific examples of these, which are quite good.  One great quote that he has to start off chapter one makes it clear that surviving adolescence has been an issue for millennia:  "Our youth now love luxury.  They have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for their elders and love chatter in place of exercise; they no longer rise when elders enter the room; they contradict their parents, chatter before company; gobble up their food and tyrannize their teachers".  This is attributed to none other than Socrates in the fifth century, B.C.  Walsh clearly defines adolescence:  "it begins at puberty and ends ... sometime".    Interwoven with the scientific information and helpful tips, he relates some stories, funny and otherwise, that most parents of those in this age group will be able to understand.  One that I found particularly humorous related to ultra cold weather and adolescent dressing habits.  This can be found on page 214.  I recommend this book.
