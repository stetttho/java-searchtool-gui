 Although there isn't much new music here, I enjoyed the DVD portion.  The DVD has concert footage of five songs which are also on the original Casting Crowns CD.  It also has a music video of 'American Dream'.  There is one bonus track:  "Beautiful Savior".  I enjoyed this, but buyers should be aware that there isn't much new here.
