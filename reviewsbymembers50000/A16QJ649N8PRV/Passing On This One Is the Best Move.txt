 I have read a couple of Meltzer's books previously and thought that they were pretty good.  This one is rather mediocre.  Although the premise for this story is one which could have had pretty good potential, it is not developed well.  The story is neither exciting nor believable.  Many of the subplots and action scenes are not credible.  The best thing about this book is the way that it shows how corrupt the workings of Congress can be and often are.  The author does a good job of showing how pork gets added into bills and the Congressional staffers have an extremely inordinate amount of power in the process.  When Congress routinely passes bills that are hundreds and even thousands of pages long, it does not take a rocket scientist to realize that many of the members have not read the bills they have approved.  Unfortunately, this plus is not enough to make the book worthwhile.  It is probably and ok book if you find it left on an airplane or something, but I would not recommend buying this one.  There are far too many books out there that are much better.
