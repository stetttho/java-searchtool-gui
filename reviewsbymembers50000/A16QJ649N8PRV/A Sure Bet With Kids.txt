 My teenage daughter has laughed herself silly with this book.  It is full of all kinds of jokes, many of which are pretty corny.  She shared a few dozen of them with me.    Here are a couple of her favorites:   Teacher:  Now, who can explain Einstein's Theory of Relativity? Li'l Jay:  Einstein?  Teacher:  Use the word MOTIF in a sentence. Li'l Jay:  My grandma wears dentures because she has no motif.  If you have a youngster who has a keen sense of humor, this will probably be a hit.
