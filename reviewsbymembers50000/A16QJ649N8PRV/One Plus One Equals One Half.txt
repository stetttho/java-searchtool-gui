 This is actually a pair of novellas.  Neither is particularly well done, but they are adequate if one doesn't have anything else to read at the moment.  I have read and thoroughly enjoyed most of Jonathan Kellerman's novels.  He is a first rate author who normally does a superb job with character development and writing a good story.  I haven't had the occasion to read any of Faye Kellerman's books previously.  Although they both may be very good authors on their own, this collaboration left something to be desired.  The characters are not well developed and the plots are thin and anticlimactic.  The Santa Fe story has somewhat better developed characters than the Boston story, but neither is too great.  I would recommend skipping this one or at least picking it up at a library or used book store.
