 I had only heard a couple of the songs on this album before buying it.  The entire CD is quite good.  Sara has very thoughtful lyrics, mostly focusing on the struggles of the Christian life.  She combines the solid words with a beautiful voice and a sound that is kind of folksy.    There are several good songs on this album.  The best is 'The Word', but I also like several others.  It is quite different but a good change of pace.
