 Napoleon Dynamite is beyond merely bad. It is really bad.  It is disjointed.  It has no plot and no action.                   It was supposed to be about a week in the life of some high school 'nerds'. There was really nothing holding it together.   There were a couple of funny spots in the show, but it is certainly not one that I would recommend. I really thought that it was a total waste of 90 minutes.  Do yourself a favor and get something else instead.
