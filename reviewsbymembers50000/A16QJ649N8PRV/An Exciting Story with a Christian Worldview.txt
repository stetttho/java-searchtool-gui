 I have previously read two of Clay Jacobsen's other novels:  "Interview With The Devil" and "Circle of Seven".  This work like the others is highly entertaining.  Jacobsen is an excellent author who weaves a Christian worldview into an exciting story.  There is lots of action and suspense in this story.  I would not only recommend this book, but also the two others that I listed above.  I hope that he writes many more.
