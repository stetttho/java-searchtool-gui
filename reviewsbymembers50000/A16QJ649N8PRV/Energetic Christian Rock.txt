 I had never heard anything by Seventh Day Slumber until I saw them in concert when they were warming up for another group; they were pretty good.  This album combines some power rock sound with some positive, meaningful lyrics.  I think that this sound would appeal to many fans of secular rock as well as Christian music fans.  There are three particularly good songs in this collection:  'Shattered Life', 'Caroline', and 'Oceans From The Rain'.  Two others that are pretty good are 'I Believe' and 'Masquerade'.  The others are ok, but nothing special.  If you like a heavier sound, this would be worth checking out.
