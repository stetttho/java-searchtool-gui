 This is one of the best novels that I have ever read.   Alcorn not only wrote a great story, he also explored some important issues in the process.  If you are looking for great Christian fiction, this would be a great place to start.  One issue that he really explores is what heaven is like.  If you are one of the many who has thought that Heaven may be great, but you want it to be a long time before you ever leave this wonderful Earth to go there, this book will challenge you.  Alcorn paints a picture of Heaven as such a beautiful and exciting place that it may actually create a yearning in you.  He certainly doesn't view it as a boring place with non stop harp music being played like so many preachers and Christians seem to do.  Alcorn will give you some fresh viewpoints to ponder. I encourage you to buy this and enjoy!
