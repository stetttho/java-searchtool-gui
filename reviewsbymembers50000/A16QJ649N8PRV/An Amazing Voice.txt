 This is one teenager with a truly amazing voice.  With a voice like this at 15, it will be a real treat to hear it when it has matured a bit.  She may be in a category by herself by the time she is twenty.  Bethany has the best super young voice I've heard since Lean Rimes first started singing professionally at twelve or whatever she was at the time.  This CD has a big advantage over even Rimes.  Bethany Dillon has meaningful songs with well written Christian lyrics.  With those words added to her sound, she has a truly incredible combination.  One interesting thing to me is the first song 'Revolutionaries.'  On that song, her voice sounds a lot like Jennifer Knapp, who is one of my favorites.  In the rest of the songs, her sound is quite different, but equally good.  Some of the songs that I think are particularly good are:  'Revolutionaries', 'Beautiful', and 'All I Need'.  None of the songs on this album is a dud though.  Although I hadn't heard her before, I will definitely be watching for her recordings in the future.
