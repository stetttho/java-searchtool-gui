 Although it doesn't have a lot of huge radio hits, 'October' is a very good U2 album.  'Gloria' may be the only song here that got considerable radio exposure, but several others should have.  This is a very high energy collection with a spiritual theme running through it.  The lyrics, vocals, and instrumental work all combine to make a very good effort.  This is an album that was pretty much ignored in their first 'best of' collection, but there are some songs here that should have made the cut.  I particularly like 'October' and 'Gloria'.  Beyond those two, there are several others that will grow on you the more you listen to them.  I recommend it.
