 This is a very enjoyable CD.  I have heard some of Rice's songs previously, but this is the first album of his that I have heard in its entirety.  His music is very mellow, but it has good lyrics and a pleasant sound.  The main reason that I bought this CD was that I thought my daughter would enjoy 'Cartoons'.  I found that it was not the only 'fun' song on this album.  'Billy Joe McGuffrey' is another great song for kids.  Actually, I have enjoyed both of those as well as several of the others also.  I particulary like 'Deep Enough to Dream'.  If you have a pre-teen or teenager, I would really recommend this for a couple of fun songs.  It is also enjoyable for adults.
