 In this live set, Jeremy Camp and his band deliver as usual.  It is much mellower than his normal sound, but just as good.  There is not a lot of new material here.  The only songs on this CD/DVD that are new are "Empty Me" and "Beautiful One".  Nevertheless, this is well worth buying.  The DVD adds a lot as compared to just having an audio CD.    Those who are fans of Jeremy Camp will enjoy this as it has a slightly different sound to enjoy as well as the video portion.  Those who are unfamiliar with him will be in for a real treat.  He is not only a fantastic singer/musician, but he is a great songwriter as well.  His lyrics are unabashedly Christian and very meaningful.  Those who are unfamiliar with his life story/testimony will also get a touch of that on the DVD.  I highly recommmend this.  I would also encourage anyone to get his CDs "Stay" and "Restored".  He is quite simply terrific.
