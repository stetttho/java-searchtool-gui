 'The Day Christ Died' tells the story of the 24 hours leading up to the death of Jesus Christ.  It takes the familiar story from the Gospels and adds details from everyday life of the time.  There are chapters on the Jewish and Roman worlds of the time that further add insight.  This book is similar to Mel Gibson's movie 'The Passion of the Christ' in the way that it focuses things on the last day.  There is also a lengthy chapter entitled 'Jesus' which tells much of the story of His earlier life.  It is very good at helping to explain the background and cultures of the times.  For instance, it adds lots of insight into the political maneuverings of Annas and Caiphas and the way their positions interacted with the Roman authorities.  This is a quick read packed with lots of information.  It is very worthwhile.
