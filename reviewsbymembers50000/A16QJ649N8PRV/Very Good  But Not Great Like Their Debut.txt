 'Lifesong' is a very good album with great lyrics.  It is not as good as the self titled debut album by 'Casting Crowns'.  That is not surprising, however, as the first one was incredible.  This collection continues providing really meaningful and thought provoking lyrics.  I don't find the songs as catchy as were the ones in their first CD.  Perhaps after listening to this a few more times, that will change.  One song that is very good lyrically and musically is the title cut, 'Lifesong'.  I also really liked the message in the following songs particularly:  Set Me Free, While You Were Sleeping, Does Anybody Hear Her, and Prodigal.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable CD.  I would recommend it. It might be good to not have expectations that it will be as good as the group's first effort, however.
