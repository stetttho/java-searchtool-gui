 This book certainly has some great places to see.  That being said, it could certainly have been a lot better.  I understand that it's the author's personal list and everyone has different tastes, but this one seems pretty elitist while missing some great things.  The biggest disappointment that I have with this book is all of the expensive hotels/restaurants.  Perhaps that is what some people want, but they might be better listed in a different type of book such as 'How to Spend a Fortune While Traveling'.  It certainly contains many of the obvious places that anyone would include in a list like this such as:  The Great Pyramids of Giza, The Okavango Delta, Mt. Kilimanjaro, Victoria Falls, Stonehenge, The Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, The Outer Banks, and numerous others.  There certainly are a great many fantastic sites listed.  On the other hand, there is only a passing reference to Kruger National Park (which should be on anyone's list), and no mention of some great spots like the Columbia River Gorge or Powell's Books in Portland (perhaps the greatest books store on the planet).  I can even see including some hotels in a book like this such as the Raffles in Singapore.  One could even see including a really unusual one like the Old Faithful Inn at Yellowstone or The Prince of Wales at Waterton Natl. Park in Alberta.  There is a passing reference to the Old Faithful Inn, but it doesn't have its own entry like many of the places that were included that are probably far less interesting and certainly far more expensive.  This book is worthwhile to own to brainstorm a great trip.  It should not be viewed as 'A Traveler's Life List' as it purports to be.
