 Although billed as a reference on accounting, this book is very inadequate for that purpose.  There are numerous accounting basics that are not mentioned or only touched on in passing.  Among those that are not addressed at all are the following:  monetary measurement, separate entity, realization, materiality.    There are also other essentials that are missing.  There are several other fundamentals that are not covered adequately.  Items in this category include these:  FIFO, LIFO, and double entry accounting.  Even the three essential reports of accounting - the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows - are inadequately covered.  This may be ok as a supplement to another book, but it is lacking a bit as a standalone on the subject it purports to cover.
