 Written as counsel to a child leaving home, Ron Mehl's book is a superb collection of wisdom on a wide range of topics.  This is written from the perspective of a Christian father who wants to ensure that his thoughts on important matters are available to his children in case he cannot be.  Mehl covers numerous examples of life's hard moments.  This volume includes his thoughts on such topics as the following:  the Bible, wisdom, humility, integrity, sin, prayer, and many others.  'Just in Case I Can't Be There' takes a look at the big picture from a spiritual perspective.  It is a timeless commentary that any Christian parent would do well to provide to his/her children when they leave home, or before, or anytime.  His wisdom is also valuable to parents and anyone else who is concerned about considering things from Christ's perspective.  I highly recommend it.
