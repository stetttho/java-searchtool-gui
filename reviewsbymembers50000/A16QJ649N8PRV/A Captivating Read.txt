 'Red' is the second installment of 'The Circle' trilogy.  It is well done and exciting.  I think it is important to have read 'Black' prior to 'Red' as I think the foundation from that book is a necessity for getting this story.  I suspect that 'Red' would not be great as a stand alone novel.  The story from 'Black' continues and intensifies greatly.  This segment is very exciting.  It is hard to put down.  There are lots of elements - action, suspense, and Christian symbolism.    I will certainly be looking forward to the conclusion of the series with 'White' in the near future.  I recommend this.
