 This is an enjoyable biography of a very interesting and accomplished person.  It will appeal to martial artists, fans of Chuck's movies and TV career, Christians, and anyone else who enjoys reading about a life of struggle culminating in major achievement.  Starting off in life with a very dedicated mother and an alcoholic and often absentee father, Mr. Norris went on to become a 6 time world middleweight karate champion.  His introduction to the martial arts was in Korea while he was stationed there in the U.S. Air Force.   His training regimen during his stay in Korea was very hardcore.   He trained in Tang Soo Do for 5 hours per day, 6 days per week and then he trained in Judo on Sundays.  Throughout the story, he traces his spiritual journey; he is now a committed Christian.  He is also very open about his flaws. It also covers the development of his KICKSTART program, which has been highly beneficial to teenagers.  Some may not like his political commentary.  He is a conservative.  He also touches on some encounters with the families of the current and formers presidents Bush.   This is an inspirational account of a very interesting American.  I recommend it.
