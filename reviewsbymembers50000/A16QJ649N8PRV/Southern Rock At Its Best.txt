 Third Day's debut is a powerful Christian album with a southern rock sound.  Mac Powell is certainly one of the best songwriters and vocalists on the planet.  Combining those traits with the rest of this band is an awesome combination.  The songs 'Thief' and 'Consuming Fire' on this album are among my all time favorites.  Anyone who has never had the pleasure of hearing Third Day sing 'Thief' should take the time and enjoy that experience.  I highly recommend this CD.
