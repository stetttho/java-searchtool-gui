 Beautiful Letdown is a thoroughly enjoyable album.  It contains songs that really rock and some more mellow ones.  The songs contain very positive lyrics along with the great sound.  One thing that is really great about this band is that they get a lot of exposure on mainstream radio stations so they spread their uplifting message to a much wider audience than equally talented bands that are confined mostly to Christian radio.  If you haven't listened to Switchfoot, you will be in for a treat.
