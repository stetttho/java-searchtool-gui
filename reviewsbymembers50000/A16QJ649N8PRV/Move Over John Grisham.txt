 This is the first book that I have read by Randy Singer and what a treat it was.  The author has composed a top-notch legal thriller that ranks with the best of John Grisham.  He has some unique and very well developed characters, lots of great courtroom action, and some incredible twists and turns.  The protagonist is a law professor and part-time street preacher who is also the defense attorney in two key cases in this story.  Another key figure/hero is a convicted drug dealer who has an encounter with Christ.  Needless to say, the characters are very interesting.  This is a novel that is hard to put down.  I highly recommend it.
