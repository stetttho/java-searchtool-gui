 Rain Fall is a very good debut that will keep most readers entertained throughout.  The story is about a Japanese American hitman plying his trade in modern day Japan.  It has an interesting combination of elements including Japanese culture, martial arts, Yakuza gangsters, corrupt politicians, as well as some romance.  The protagonist, John Rain, is really an anti-hero.  He is a hired killer with his own twisted ethics.  He won't kill women, children, or non-principals.  The killing must not be used just to send a message.  Of course, if some target fits his criteria, he will kill regardless of the reason.  He is also hired by totally unknown subjects with indeterminate motives.  I enjoyed the story and it had my interest throughout.  I didn't care for the fact that Rain is a martial artist who has little integrity, which is a bad combination.  In spite of that, the story is entertaining.  I recommend it.
