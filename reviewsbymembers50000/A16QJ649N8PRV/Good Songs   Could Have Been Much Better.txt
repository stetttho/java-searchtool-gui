 When I bought this album, I was hoping to have a modern version of some old hymns.  I guess it was, but it was mostly a country sound, which is not what I was expecting.  Bart Millard has great talent.  He is the driving force behind MercyMe.  Had he used that style of music in modernizing these hymns, they could have really been good.  As it is, most of them were nice, but nothing great.  There were a couple of exceptions to that.  I think he did a very good job on 'The Old Rugged Cross' and 'My Jesus I Love Thee'.  Probably the best song on the album was partially a hymn, but mostly an original that Millard wrote - 'Mawmaw's Song (In The Sweet By and By).    As this is titled 'Hymned No. 1', I'm assuming that he is planning to do some more remakes of hymns.  I hope that he will do them more in the MercyMe style.  One album of new sound hymns that I would highly recommend is 'Redemption Songs' by Jars of Clay.
