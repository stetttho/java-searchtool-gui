 'The Fallen' is a murder mystery with some interesting twists.  I don't recall ever having read a novel by T. Jefferson Parker before, but I will probably do so in the future.  This is a book that will keep the reader entertained throughout.  It features Robbie Brownlaw who is a San Diego homicide detective with an unusual form of synesthesia, a condition that allows him to see colored shapes when people are talking and functions sort of like a 'primitive lie detector'.  The author uses this plot device without overdoing it.  There are numerous twists and turns and several possible suspects in the death of a city ethics investigator with lots of enemies.  Parker manages to keep the guessing going to the end.  I recommend it.
