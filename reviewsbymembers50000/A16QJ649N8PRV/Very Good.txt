 This is a very enjoyable 'best of' collection by Chris Rice.  He combines solid Christian lyrics with a pleasant mellow sound.  One song on here that is very good and is a challenge to Christians is "Go Light Your World."   His admonition to go and make a difference to those who don't know Christ is particularly good.  Another one that I had never heard before is "Mama Prays."  It is one that should really remind parents of the importance of praying for their children.  There are several other very good songs and none that I dislike.  Three of the songs in this collection are also on his 'Snapshots: Live and Fan Favorites' CD.  Those are the following:  'Deep Enough to Dream,' 'Cartoons,' and 'Come to Jesus'.    For anyone who has children of any age, 'Cartoons' is a must have song.  It will provide lots of entertainment and fun to the young and young at heart.  I would recommend this CD.
