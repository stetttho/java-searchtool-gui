 This prequel to the Left Behind series is pretty good as far as providing some background on two of the main characters in the LB series - Rayford Steele and Nicholae Carpathia.  It also touches a bit upon Viv Ivins, but much less than the other two.  As one who has enjoyed the series, I found this book to be a worthwhile addition.  However, I would not recommend it to someone who has not read the others.  I don't think it would be too great as a stand alone book.  Additionally, it indicates that there will be two more volumes in the prequel series.  To me, that seems somewhat excessive.  I think that a bit more could have been added to this and have the pre-series history captured in one book.  As one who has read all of them, I will probably read the next two as well, but I really think that it could have been compacted somewhat.  For anyone who is not too excited about more in this series, I would highly recommend any of the following for excellent Christian fiction:  Dominion and Deadline by Randy Alcorn and Circle of Seven and Interview with the Devil by Clay Jacobsen.
