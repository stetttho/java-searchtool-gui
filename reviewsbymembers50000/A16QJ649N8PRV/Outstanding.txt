 Rebecca St. James has one of the most beautiful voices on the planet.    In this album she compiles her greatest hits into a dynamic collection.  Her songs are filled with powerful messages.  She wrote or co-wrote most of the songs here.  There are so many great songs that it's hard to pick favorites.  In spite of that, I am a bit partial to 'God'.  However, that is certainly not to take away from the other great tunes here.  She does a version of Keith Green's 'Until Your Love Broke Through' that is superb.  She also sings 'Breathe' on this CD.  It is another of the few that she didn't write, but performs magnificently.  If you are not familiar with Rebecca's work, do yourself a favor, and treat yourself to this CD.
