 I decided to check out 'The Running Girl' after reading and enjoying many of Dan Blankenship's reviews on Amazon.  I wasn't disappointed.   He has written a  good first novel with lots of action, spiritual warfare, and good vs. evil.  It is thought provoking as well.  This novel is quite reminiscent of Frank Peretti in many ways.  It is fast paced as well.  My only criticism is that it is too short.  I would have enjoyed more of this story.   I look forward to reading Blankenship's next book.
