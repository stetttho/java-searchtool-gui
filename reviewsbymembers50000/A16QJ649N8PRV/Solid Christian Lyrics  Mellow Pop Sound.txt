 Spoken For is another solid effort by MercyMe.  It has a fairly mellow pop sound with solid Christian lyrics throughout.  There are three standout songs in my opinion.  'Word of God Speak' is a phenomenol hit.  Another one that I had heard a lot before was the title track, 'Spoken For'.  One song that I had never heard before that is very good is 'Crazy'.  It speaks about the seeming absurdities of the Christian life while concluding, 'You can call me crazy.'  This is an enjoyable CD that will be a hit with any MercyMe fan.  It is also well worth listening to for anyone else.
