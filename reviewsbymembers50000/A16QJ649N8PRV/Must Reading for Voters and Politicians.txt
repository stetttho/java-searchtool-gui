 This book takes a subject that is considered rather boring by a large number of people and explains it in simple and enjoyable terms.    Hazlitt does a really good job of explaining many of the fallacies in the practice of economics that are foisted upon the citizens and debunks them one by one.  He uses a story form to educate the readers on the problems with typically inflicted governmental action in about 25 areas  including the following:  government 'make work' projects, taxes, credit, machinery, reductions in numbers of government employees, tariffs, price fixing, subsidizing commodities, rent control, minimum wage laws, unions, profits, and attacks on savings.  As politicians around the world, including the United States, regularly make harmful errors in their attempts to buy votes, this should be required reading for all of them, as well as college economics professors who are so enamoured with Keynes and Marx.  Hazlitt does a great job in making the case that, prior to taking action on economic issues, decision makers should look at the effect on everyone involved (not just the groups that they are trying to seduce into voting for them) as well as the long range implications of the policy.  Readers should come away from reading this with a clear understanding of the marvels of a free market (if we were ever allowed to have one) and the incredibly damaging effects of governmental manipulations of the economy.  I would strongly  recommend this for reading by all voters who want to be knowlegeable as well as all elected and appointed officials.
