 Although I have really enjoyed some of the previous novels that Iles has written, I found this one to be bizarre, implausible, and disappointing.  As I am not a fan of horror, I should have gotten a clue when this had an endorsement by Stephen King on the cover.  Unfortunately, I decided to read it anyway since I had liked some of Iles' previous work.  The story line is ridiculous.  It involved the long dead ex-girlfriend (Mallory) of the main character (John Waters) who has come back and begun possessing the bodies of people near to Waters.  Her intention is apparently to rekindle the former relationship through the bodies of others.  It doesn't stop there with the implausibility.  At one point in the book, the DNA of one character is altered by having been possessed briefly by Mallory.  If I were going to classify this book, it would probably be as a bizarre science fiction novel that is not well done.  The ending, in particular, was very anticlimactic.  I would not recommend this book.  If one is into Stephen King type stuff, he/she might find it to be okay.  For anyone else, I would recommend skipping it.
