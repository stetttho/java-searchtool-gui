 This book does a very good job of helping people recognize behaviors and actions that may lead to trouble.  Unfortunately, this book has some flaws and certainly could have been better.  Mr. De Becker is clearly an expert at teaching about manipulation, grooming, and other patterns of behavior that often precede violence.  He does a great service in explaining techniques used by antisocials and ways to counteract them by following our instincts.  On the down side, the book contains a lot of anti-gun propaganda.  The author tends to make unsubstantiated claims about how having a gun makes one less safe.  He uses a couple of examples while ignoring the hundreds of cases annually where individuals with weapons have saved their own lives or those of others.  Additionally, he tends to do a lot of self promotion for his company and name dropping of the ultra leftist elites of Hollywood.  Although it may impress some readers that he has connections with Rosie O'Donnell and Barbara Streisand, it certainly does nothing to enhance his credibility.  On the contrary, it makes him appear to be a liberal with an agenda.  In this case, that is making people less self reliant for their own protection while promoting his company.  That is unfortunate as it takes away from the rest of the book that is so good.  In spite of the propaganda and self promotion, I would encourage people to read this book.  It has a lot of good to go along with the bad parts.  It might just help save the life of someone who is involved with an abusive partner or dealing with a stalker.
