 The story is essentially about an embattled corporate CEO who has his daughter kidnapped by his ex wife and taken off to Germany.  The CEO, Dale Steadman, hires attorney Marcus Glenwood to help get her back.    The action takes place on both sides of the Atlantic with an interesting cast.  Bunn did a very good job at developing the characters in particular.   Two of the characters that are very well done are Erin Brandt who is an international opera diva and the ex wife of Steadman.  She has never bonded with the child and is an overall bad apple.  The other main female character is Kirsten Stansted, who is Glenwood's fiancee.  She has a similar rough background to Brandt, but has developed into a positive person.   Bunn takes some diverse elements such as opera (which would probably top my list of boring subjects) and is able to make them reasonably interesting.   Although it is a 'Christian' novel, it touches very little on the spiritual side of things.  I think it would have been better if there was some more of that.   Overall, this was an entertaining book.  I don't think it is as good as Bunn's previous novel 'The Great Divide', but it is worth a read.
