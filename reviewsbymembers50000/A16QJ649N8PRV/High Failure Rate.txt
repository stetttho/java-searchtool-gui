 These Memorex CD-Rs did not work well at all for me.  I would not recommend them.  I bought a spindle of 100 as the price seemed like a pretty good deal.   I tried burning 20 of these.  Out of that group of twenty, twelve were duds.  I am no audio expert by any means, and there may be some great reason why they didn't work with my system.  Unfortunately, there was no warning indicating that they might not work well with certain types of computers.  The system that I am using is a Dell that was new within the last few months.  I have also bought the Verbatim CD-Rs and had very good luck with them.  I would caution buyers to consider buying a smaller quantity initially if they are thinking about buying the Memorex CD-Rs.
