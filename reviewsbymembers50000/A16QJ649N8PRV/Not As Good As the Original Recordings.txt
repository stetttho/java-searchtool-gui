 This is a pretty good album.  I personally prefer the original versions of virtually all of these songs to those that are remixed here.  Those who are Newsboys fans will probably enjoy listening to this just because it's a different take on a great band.  For those who are not familiar with them, I would definitely recommend listening to an album with the original versions of their songs first.  Their greatest hits collection, 'Shine',  would be a great place to start.  It will give listeners a good overall taste of many of the best songs of a great band.   Those who have never listened to the Newsboys but enjoy Christian music should definitely treat themselves to an album or two.
