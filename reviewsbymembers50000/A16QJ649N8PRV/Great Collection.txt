 This worship album by Rebecca St. James is terrific.    From beginning to end, it is a sonic delight of praise for the Creator of the Universe.  Although some of the songs have been done, and done very well, by others, the overall album is excellent.  Rebecca's voice is superb and the song collection on this album cannot be topped.    Do yourself a favor and buy this great album.
