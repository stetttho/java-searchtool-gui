 This album by Tait has several very good songs.  The songs have solid Christian lyrics that are arranged in some very catchy tunes.  'Empty' is the best of the solo projects by the former DC Talkers that I have heard.  As always, Michael Tait has a superb voice.  In this album it is combined with some great instrumental work, some of which have a rather rocking sound.  This is a good CD that I would recommend.
