 'Black' is an interesting and very different novel with spiritual implications.    I thought it started off a bit slow and had some very strange parts, but it started grabbing me partway into the book.  I am not a big fantasy or science fiction fan, yet I enjoyed this one a lot.  I have read some of Dekker's other books and probably liked them a bit better, but this one continued to get better as it went along.  I will definitely plan to get the next installment in this series -'Red' - and see if it improves even more.  You will certainly not be bored with this story.  I recommend it.
