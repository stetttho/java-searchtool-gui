 Ginny Owens is an artist who certainly knows how to make beautiful music.  She also has powerful Christian lyrics.  She is obviously someone who has a deep faith and shows it in her songwriting.  Her music here has an R&B sound to it.  It is centered around her piano playing.  The sound is superb.  The songs here are about God's faithfulness to us, His unconditional love for us, the pleasures that He provides for us, and the awesome prize at the end.  I recommend this CD for the sound and the message both.
