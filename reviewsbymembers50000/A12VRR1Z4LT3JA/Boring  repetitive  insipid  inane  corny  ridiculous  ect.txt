 I actually wish that Amazon made negative star reviews possible. This is one of the worst novels I've tried to read in the past ten years, and I've read some duds.  Really, this is the first one that I just could not make myself finish. Ms. Jordan underestimates the intelligence of romance readers.  She repeats the same plot elements over and over and over again, as if it were possible to forget the overly simplistic thoughts, feelings, and actions of the characters. Ms. Jordan also relies too much on narration (telling, not showing), so the conversations and interactions between the characters are few and far between.  The lavender prose and the one-dimensional protagonists only serve to emphasize the author's laziness, it seems that she only wanted to reach a certain word count by recycling plot elements from Romance Novel Land.  Don't waste your time or money.  If you want to read hot romance novels written by intelligent authors for intelligent readers, try anything by Madeline Hunter or Liz Carlyle.
