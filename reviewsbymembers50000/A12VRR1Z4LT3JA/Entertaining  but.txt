 Ms. Chase is a wonderfully talented writer.  That said, this book cannot compare to Lord of Scoundrels.  While reading this novel, I kept remembering the movies The Mummy and The Mummy Returns with Brendan Fraser.  I enjoyed those movies, but when I read a romance I want more depth and substance.  The descriptions of Egypt and the research done by the heroine are too detailed and the plot and character development suffer because of this, since the book is only a little over 300 pages long.  What caused Rupert to become a hellion? What was his life like before going to Egypt? He is apparently the product of a happy family, but we only learn about this in the last couple of pages. How did he become such an understanding and insightful man when we are given to understand that his life was aimless and he was known by everyone as a ne'er do well?   Daphne's character is better developed and we get to know her better.  Still, the whole experience left me unsatisfied.  If Ms. Chase removed all the plot elements that were not directly related to the romance itself, I'm afraid we would be left with less than one hundred pages.  The resolution of the "conflict" came in the last five pages and even that was almost nonexistent and contrived.    I'm not sure if I'll read any other books in the series, despite Ms. Chase's fine writing, though I am sure that I'll reread Lord of Scoundrels many times.
