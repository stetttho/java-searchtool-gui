 I am an avid reader and I make myself read every book that I start reading, so I made myself finish this novel.  The book started with an interesting premise when the hero is taken away for several years and blames the heroine for deceiving him. Of course, she is innocent.  After this beginning, it takes the author a couple of hundred pages to cover what happens in a couple of days, which makes for slow "action" and plot development.  For discriminating reader, details are important, so I will stick with Liz Carlyle.   Another issue I have is the constant mention of body "scents" when both hero and heroine have spent days on the road.  The hero goes from smelling of sweat to smelling of leather and grass without going near soap and water.  I realize that this is a medieval romance, but I appreciate the mention of baths now and then, especially when the author remarks repeatedly on the unkempt appearance of the heroine. This was a complete turn off and at one point, I could not concentrate on a love scene because during this section the author also mentioned the heroine's dirty hands, hair, clothes, feet, etc. Ugh!  The author needs to work on character development and on consistency.  Both hero and heroine jump from one mood to another without transition or enough justification, so I felt that the author was just skimming the surface and her characters were superficial as a result.  Finally, the hero's two year old daughter has the attitude and vocabulary of an eight year old.  I had to check the author's biography to see if she had children (she has a son) because the depiction of this character made me think that she had never been around a two year old, even a precocious one.
