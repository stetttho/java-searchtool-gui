 This is the third book by Lucy Monroe that I read and I think it will be my last.  The first book I read by this author was "The Real Deal" which was a keeper.  The second was "Come Up And See Me Some Time" (a title that makes no sense within the novel's context) and was like a thousand other tired romances.  In "Ready" Ms. Monroe seems to want to write like Shannon McKenna, but doesn't come close.  The suspense in the plot is contrived and simply serves as a convenient device to throw the hero and heroine together.  Joshua is just "too perfect" and is like a caricature without depth or real vulnerability.  Lise is drawn inconsistently and goes from shy writer to super sexual "she-wolf" (ugh) without any credibility. I enjoy a sensual novel, but the way that the author writes the intimate scenes is repetitive, disruptive , tiresome, and unreal even for a romance novel.  As another reviewer remarked, there is no friction whatsoever between the h/h, there is no depth, and the action fails to grab the reader. It seems Ms. Monroe is a one-hit wonder, a pity and a waste of $14.00.
