 A solid 4 stars.  As many of her readers, I will wait anxiously for Ms. Carlyle's books and purchase them immediately.  Even when she is not at her best, her romances are immensely enjoyable and superior to those of almost any other author.  In Two Little Lies, there is little to complain about.  The characters are multi-dimensional, the plot is riveting, and the writing is flawless (although there are many typos in the print).  I was torn between reading fast because I was so engrossed in the story and savoring the book slowly because I did not want it to be over.  If you have never read this author, it is safe to say that you can pick any of her novels.  If you like intelligent, layered, sensual, and passionate stories, you won't be dissapointed.
