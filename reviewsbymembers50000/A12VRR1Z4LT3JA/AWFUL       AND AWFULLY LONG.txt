 This is the first, and last, novel that I read by Ms. Foley.  It took me over a month to read it, while I read and re-read several novels in between.  I finally made myself finish it by skimming through most of it.  The plot is thin and contrived.  The first 24 hours of the action take over half the book, and it is a long book at 467 pages.  Issues that could be resolved in a few pages took several chapters and the detailed descriptions of everything from clothes to houses only served to pad the book and bore the reader.  The heroine is too precious and the hero is perfectly tortured. The "love" scenes are deep purple and uninspiring.  Nobody is concerned with the proprieties and the actions of the heroine regarding her reputation are anacronistic and unrealistic, even by romance novel standards.  This book went straight to the trash and I won't waste any more time nor money on this author.
