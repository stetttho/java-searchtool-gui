 This is the first novel by Jo Beverley that I read and I loved it.  The writing style is intelligent, delightful, moving, and doesn't patronize the reader.  I found myself crying, laughing, and could not stop reading.  The h/h are both very well developed characters and both are very nice persons that the reader can feel empathy for.  The secondary characters are also very well developed and contribute to the story, I especially liked Digby, the heroine's elderly husband.  The setting is an integral part of the story and Ms. Beverley takes the reader there very artfully.  The story, although, unlikely, is very romantic.  There are two reasons why I didn't give this novel 5 stars:  The first is that the h/h don't spend enough time together (although the time they do spend with each other is maximized) and the second is that the resolution of the conflict is very complicated and takes a long time, which means that the reader doesn't get to enjoy their happiness.  Considering Ms. Beverley's evident talent, I was expecting something more and felt a little let down.  I will be reading the other books in the series, since finding a writer this satisfying is rare indeed.
