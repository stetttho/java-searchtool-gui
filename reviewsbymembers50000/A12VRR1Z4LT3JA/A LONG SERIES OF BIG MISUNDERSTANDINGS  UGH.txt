 The heroine is too perfect, except when it comes to common sense.  The hero is so tortured that his intelligence is impaired, which makes him jump to wrong conclusions time after time after time. Ms. McNaught jumps from misunderstanding to misunderstanding, which frustrated me because the main characters did not seem to learn from their past mistakes regarding each other. Finally, after spending so much time on melodramatic nonsense, there is not an epilogue that shows how the protagonists managed to overcome their lack of effective communication to understand each other and live happily ever after. Not recommended.
