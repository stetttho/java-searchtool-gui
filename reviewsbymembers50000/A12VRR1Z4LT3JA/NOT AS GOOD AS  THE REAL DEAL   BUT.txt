 Actually, 2 1/2 stars. As other reviewers, I discovered Lucy Monroe with "The Real Deal" and I loved the way she developed each character's personality and growth.  Those characters were multi-dimensional and emotionally mature.  In "Come Up And See Me Sometime" (has anyone figured out the meaning of the title and how it relates to the story?) I found that the characters are not as well developed and their actions are impulsive and unrealistic, even by romance novel standards.  The plot relies on big and little misunderstandings which cast doubt on the probability of the hero and heroine building a solid happily ever after.  At times it seemed that I was reading an old Harlequin Presents that had been padded to make a longer novel. The writer also abuses metaphors and her prose in this novel is a medium shade of purple.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the story and have hopes that Ms. Monroe will refine her writing and deliver according to the promise shown in "The Real Deal".
