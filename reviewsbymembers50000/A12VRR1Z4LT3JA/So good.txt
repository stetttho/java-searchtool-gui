 I loved this book.  As usual, Ms. Carlyle's writing is riveting and full of nuances.  I loved the emotional tone of the novel and to me both the hero and heroine felt real and well developed. The author transported me to the time and place without needless repetitions and minute descriptions.  As always, all the characters contribute to the story and are written in a believable manner.  Also as usual, Ms. Carlyle writes about a child and this does not detract from the plot at all, but enriches it.  My only complaint, as with all her other novels, is the lack of an epilogue.  The last chapter is too short and seems rushed.  An epilogue would have allowed the reader to enjoy the lovers' happiness and the family's reactions.  Other than that, I appreciate that this author writes beautifully and intelligently.  Please, Ms. Carlyle, keep them coming!
