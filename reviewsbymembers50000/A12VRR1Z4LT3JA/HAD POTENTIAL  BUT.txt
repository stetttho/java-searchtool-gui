 Ms. McCarthy writes well, but this novel shows that she still has to grow and mature as a romance writer.  Josie, the heroine, describes herself, ad nauseam, as flabby, overweight, too short, too soft, too white, and full of cellulite, but even as she puts herself down all the time, the author wants us to think that the heroine loves herself and is happy the way she is. This would be easier to believe if Josie did not spend over 50% of the novel, literally, reminding the reader how physically unappealing she thinks she is, until I finally saw her that way and lost whatever "magic" I had felt.  On the other hand, the perfectly tall, dark, and handsome hero thinks Josie is a perfectly adorable sex goddess.  Much of the novel is spent on these conflicting points of view and very soon it becomes boring and tiresome.  I certainly appreciate having a heroine that is less than perfect physically and a hero that loves that body, but I don't like to be reminded of that fact page after page after page.  The author sacrificed further character and plot development trying too hard to be funny well beyond the limit.  I read Smart Mouth, by the same author, and liked it much better.  I have hopes for Ms. McCarthy, but I will be more careful with my money in the future and just go to the library.  A final complaint, at $14.00 I expect every page to count and don't appreciate a blank page between many chapters.
