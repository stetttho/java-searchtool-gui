 I discovered Liz Carlyle quite by accident and I'm very happy.  She is very skilled with words and a wonderful storyteller.  While reading My False Heart I savored each word. I could not stop reading and at the same time I did not want the book to end.  All the characters are unique and very well developed. The descriptions of the family's interactions and the hero and heroine's feelings and thoughts were a rare treat! I have a new favorite author.  Highly recommended!
