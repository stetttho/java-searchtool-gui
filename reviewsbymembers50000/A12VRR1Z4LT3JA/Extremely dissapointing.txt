 I did not like the prequel of this book, "COME UP AND SEE ME SOMETIME", but in a moment of weakness I decided to give this novel a chance, hoping that Ms. Monroe would go back to the promise she showed in "THE REAL DEAL".  Sadly, I was very dissapointed.  The characters are flat, stereotypical, and annoying.  They never show trust in one another.  Almost up to the last page they are doubting each other's actions and intentions.  Ms. Monroe's writing is also annoying because she keeps repeating and rehashing thoughts, emotions, and worse, the events that happened 18 months ago.  This shows little respect for the readers' intelligence and tolerance.  I won't be giving this author another chance.
