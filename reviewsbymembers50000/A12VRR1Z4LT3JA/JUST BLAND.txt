 I bought this book based on the excellent reviews it was given by theromancereader.com and likesbooks.com, but frankly it took me forever to finish.  Usually when I have trouble reading a book it is because the writing is terrible and the story ridiculous. That is not the case with this novel, I have to say that the author writes well and does not underestimate the intelligence of the reader.  However, the story just didn't engage my attention. The hero and heroine go on, and on, AND ON about why they are not right for each other while they search for her runaway charge.  And that is about all that happens for most of the novel.  The sensual tension is almost non-existent and I just felt like I was on an endless road trip with two semi-boring people.  This is my first book by this author and I'm not sure I'll try her again.  It just was not worth the time and expense.  Very dissapointing.
