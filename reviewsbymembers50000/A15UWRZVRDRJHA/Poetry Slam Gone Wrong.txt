 Let me begin by saying that I like Patricia Barber, and I wrote a very positive review of "Cafe Blue".  But Duke Ellington said "it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing", and this recording doesn't swing.  As the title suggests, this one is all about the lyrics, and in my humble opinion she's trying too hard.  The end result is overly intellectual and sterile.
