 When my 1978 "Joy of Cooking" finally split into two halves, I went out and bought the new edition.  At first, I was bitterly disappointed.  I wanted to make a Southwestern cranberry sauce, and went to the "Joy of Cooking" for a basic cranberry sauce recipe to "tweak".  Well, the new edition doesn't have a cranberry sauce recipe.  So I bought a new copy of the old "Joy", which is still available (and which I rate 5 stars).  However, one should not dismiss the new "Joy".  It has recipes for many of the new "basics" like Buffalo Wings, that the old "Joy" lacks.  In fact, it is a nice compliment to the old "Joy".  Every comprehensive cookbook collection should have both.
