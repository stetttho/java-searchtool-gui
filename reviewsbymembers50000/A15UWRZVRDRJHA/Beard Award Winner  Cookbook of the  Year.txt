 I'm going out on a limb here and reviewing a book I have not read.  However, I thought it is worth passing on the information that the James Beard Foundation has selected this book as it's "cookbook of the year".    It sounds like this book is heavy on technique, which is where my recent cookbook purchases have been concentrated.  With the Internet and my already large cookbook collection, I don't necessarily need more recipes.  But it would be useful to have a book that shows how to prepare fish.  That's why I'm ordering this book.
