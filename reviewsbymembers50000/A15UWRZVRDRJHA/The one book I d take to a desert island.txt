 This is the one cookbook I'd take with me to a desert island!  The recipes are tropical and amenable to island living.  Many involve cooking in palm tree leaves and the like, so it would be a natural in the hot sun.   But  even if I were staying home, this would be the one cookbook I'd keep if I  had to give away the 99 others.  I figure I can "wing it" if I'm  cooking normal American food, but the recipes in this book are so creative  and far out, that I'd never come up with this stuff without help!  This  book is awesome! I can't believe that it's out of print!
