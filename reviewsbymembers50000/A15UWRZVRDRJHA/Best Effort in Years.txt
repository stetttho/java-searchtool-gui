 Cynics might say that "Licence to Chill" is a calculated move to follow up on the success of Jimmy's hugely successful duet with Alan Jackson, "It's Five O'clock Somewhere". Jimmy says that "Licence to Chill" was already in the works when "Five O'clock Somewhere" was recorded, but calculated or not, the album should be considered on its merits. I find it very enjoyable, with a nice flow--unlike other duet packages such as Frank Sinatra's dreadful Duets I and II. It's some of Jimmy's best work in years.    I particularly enjoy "Boats to Build" with (who else) Alan Jackson, "Conky Tonkin'" with Clint Black, "Sea of Heartbreak" with George Strait, and especially "Trip Around the Sun" with Martina McBride.     Much has been made of this foray into so-called "country music". The truth is that Jimmy has always been difficult to categorize, and I think there have always been elements of country music in his Key West beach bum music. "Let's Get Drunk..." comes immediately to mind. It's always been a fusion of styles, and I don't mind a little pedal steel guitar added to the mix. "Licence to Chill", "Coast of Carolina", and "Back to the Island" could have been on any other Jimmy Buffett album--and probably will be on a future greatest hits package.
