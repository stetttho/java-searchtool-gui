 This is not a "new" Dallas Wayne CD.  It was released in 1999 on Dallas's Finnish label Texicalli Records. (Dallas spend many years doing the expat thing in Finland.) On several occasions, I have bought a "breakout" album by an artist and liked it so much that I bought some earlier work by the same artist.  Inevitably this leads to disappointment.  Invisible Man is not up to the very high standard of Dallas's "breakout" album Big Thinkin', which is awesome, awesome, awesome.  But there is some foreshadowing of things to come. "Hoedown in Hell" and "I Hit the Road (and the Road Hit Back)" are could fit in with some of the honky-tonk gems on Big Thinkin'. But overall, the tone of the album is more reflective.  It's more of a singer-songwriter album.  "Invisible Man" and "God Must Have Got Drunk (Last Night)" are two of my favorites.
