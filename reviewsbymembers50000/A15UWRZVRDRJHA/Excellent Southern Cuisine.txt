 This is one of my favorite cookbooks. It's full of beautiful pictures and really great recipes.  As you might expect, it has lots of recipes with the sponsor's product in it, and of course, they are really good.  The chocolate velvet cake with Jack Black and the "tipsy sweet potatoes" are definite keepers. But so are the many recipes from Miss Bobo's boarding house.  Miss Bobo did not allow spirits on the premises.  One of my favorites that always draws raves is the artichoke, spinach, and mushroom casserole.
