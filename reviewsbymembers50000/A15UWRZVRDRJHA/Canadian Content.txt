 Under Canadian Law, radio stations are required to broadcast a certain percentage of Canadian content.  My Canadian friends complain that this makes Canadian radio boring.  So it is with this CD.  Just like the cover, it's all grey and white.    There are plenty of talented Canadian artists--k d herself, as a case in point, so why pick these songs?   I'm a huge Neil Young fan, but I think it's a mistake for anybody but him to sing his stuff.  His songs are personal in a way that doesn't translate well.  As for the Leonard Cohen covers--is the world not a depressing enough place without more Leonard Cohen?  And why re-record "Simple", the weakest track on Invincible Summer?  How about some new k d Lang / Ben Mink originals?   There is a dwindling number of artists whose stuff I buy without hearing first.  I'm afraid k d has fallen out off that list.
