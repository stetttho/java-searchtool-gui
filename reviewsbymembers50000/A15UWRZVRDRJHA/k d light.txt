 I'm a huge fan of kd Lang's, and I've been awaiting this album with great anticipation.  However, I was disappointed upon first listening.  It's not another Ingenue.  For me, the hallmarks of kd's best works are thoughful  lyrics and deep emotion, and this album is lacking in both.   I noticed  that only one of the songs, "Love's Great Ocean", was co-written  with Ben Mink, kd's long-time collaborator.  I hope that there has been no  great falling out, because Ben's talents are clearly missed here.  Many of  the songs on this album are really lightweight, like the aptly named  "Simple".  However, I should admit that the "Consequences of  Falling" is growing on me, and the instrumentation on the album is  luscious.   The Washington Post printed a gushy review saying that this  would be a great Karen Carpenter album.  Ok.  But I hold kd to a higher  standard.    Everybody is entitled to a Summer Fling, and I look forward  to kd this summer at Wolf Trap,  but I hope she gets serious again when  there's frost on the pumpkin. Meanwhile, I'll enjoy her summer album with a  nice cold pina colada.
