 I had the pleasure of seeing Dallas Wayne play live on Friday night.  I picked up the CD right away, and it's already become one of my favorites.  When I got it home, I played it three times in a row!  Most of the songs are absolutely great.  The words are clever and witty, the playing is first-rate, and Dallas's voice is as smooth as 12-year-old whiskey.  I especially enjoy "If That's Country", which takes dead aim at some of the so-called "country" music on the radio.  The title track ain't bad either.
