 My old shaver was a Remington Intercept, a model that's no longer made.  It shaved great and had a really useful trimmer that could trim hair, beard, sideburns, etc.  Unfortunately, the battery was just plain terrible.  After using it for three years, I finally replaced it with the Braun, which I got from Amazon in a Gold Box special.   As I said in the title, the battery is incredible.  I've taken it on vacation for a whole week and left the charger at home.  But sadly, it doesn't do a very good job shaving.  The foil is only about 2/3 the size of the Remington foil, and I believe that is the problem.
