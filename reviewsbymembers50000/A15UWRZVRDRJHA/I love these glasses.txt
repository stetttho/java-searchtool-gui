 I bought four of these cabernet "O" glasses after a visit to my local wineseller.  He was so impressed with them that he uses only them for wine tastings.  He said that after months of use, he had not broken any in the dishwasher.  I'm pleased to say that after a year of regular use, I haven't broken any either. I love the feel of the glass in my hand and the thin glass on my lips.  It feels luxurious.  I rarely use my stemmed glasses anymore.   Just last month, representatives from Reidel did a demonstration at the store of the various types of Reidel glasses.  Those who were there (I was not) said that chardonnay tasted far better in the chardonnay glass than in the other glasses.  Same for all  the other wine varieties.  Evidently, these guys know their stuff.
