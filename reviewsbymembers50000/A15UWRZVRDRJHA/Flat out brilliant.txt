 I had seen these in the stores and was dubious about them, but I received one as a gift.  What can I say?  It works brilliantly.   In my household of one, it generally takes three days to drink a bottle of wine.  In my opinion, the Vacu Vin is much better for whites than reds.  In my pre-VV days, I found that after one day in the fridge, a half bottle of white was noticably flat.  No more!  A day-old half bottle tastes brand new, and a week old quarter bottle is very drinkable.  For reds left on the kitchen counter, without VV they would be undrinkable after three days. With VV they have definitely lost a step, but they are still very drinkable.  Friends have told me to keep my opened reds in the fridge for maximum effectiveness, but I haven't tried that.   I was so impressed with this little gadget that I gave one as a wedding present to a vine-loving friend.  Now he gives them to his friends.
