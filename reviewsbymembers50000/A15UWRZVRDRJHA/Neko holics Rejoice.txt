 Neko Case is a little lady with a great big voice.  Unlike most female singers in "country" music, Neko writes her own material, so this album should be judged as much by the material as the performance.  Fortunately, Blacklisted is a triumph on both scores.  Upon first listening, I found it a bit remote and less accessible than Furnace Room Lullaby, a truly great album.  But as Rubber Soul gave way to Revolver, which gave way to Sergeant Pepper, it's sometimes uncomfortable as an artist grows.  And this album has indeed grown on me.  The album begins with "Things That Scare Me", a song that would fit right into Furnace Room Lullaby, but from there the journey grows darker from "Deep Red Bells" with it's imagery of death on the interstate to the deeply disturbing "Lady Pilot" who's not afraid to die.  The title track "Blacklisted" could be the theme song to a David Lynch film noir, or even a James Bond film over the opening credits, as red blood covers the screen.  The song ends with the lyrics "slow down fast train, take me with you", and the last track "Ghost Wiring" repeats the themes of loneliness and loss. For my money, the best performances go to the two cover songs "Runnin' Out of Fools" and the straight-ahead torch song "Look for Me, (I'll Be Around)."  In person, Neko comes across as happy, or at least cheerful.  I think she exorcises her demons in her music, and you know, she exorcises mine too.  I always feel better after hearing her.
