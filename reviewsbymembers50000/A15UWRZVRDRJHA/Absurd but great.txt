 Members of my beach house and I stumbled into the Dogfish Head in Rehoboth Beach where Laika and the Cosmonauts were playing.  We all came out converts to the Cosmonaut cause.  Two bought t-shirts and one bought a copy of "Absurdistan", which became our house theme music immediately.  We play it on the porch, to the amazement of tourists and locals alike.  Most always we get the thumbs up. Check out the free download of "Disconnected" and see for yourself!
