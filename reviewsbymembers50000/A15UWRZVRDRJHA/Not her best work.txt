 If you're a hard-core Neko Case fan like I am, you need to buy this CD.  There's some precious new material here that's really quite good: "Train from Kansas City", "Rated X", and a really nice performance of the traditional "Wayfaring Stranger".  The old chestnut "Favorite" also makes it's debut on a "major" label CD (if Anti is a major label).  It had been previously available only on Canadian Amp, sold only at Neko's shows.  On the other hand, if you're looking to buy your first Neko Case CD, buy "Blacklisted" instead.  I'd rate it as one of my top five "Desert Island" CD's.  The live performance of "Blacklisted" is probably the most powerful track on "Tigers".
