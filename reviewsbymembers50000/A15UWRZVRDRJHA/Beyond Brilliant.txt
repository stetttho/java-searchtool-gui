 I bought "I Want You" on vinyl when it first came out in 1976.  It quickly became one of my favorites--and the favorite of many others as well.  I found a site on the web that said "I Want You" has been covered by 33 artists.  My favorite is Gato Barbieri's burning sax version, also from 1976.  In the transition to CD, Motown released their back catalog in a bunch of cheesy two-fers, with "I Want You" backed with "I Heard it Through the Grapevine".  Fearing that "I Want You" might disappear from sight, I bought it. So I was more than pleased to get a first rate version of one of my favorite albums with a very cool bonus in this package.  The bonus album is kind of a "shadow" version of "I Want You" with alternate extended takes of every song on the album in the original order.  Honestly, I haven't taken it off my CD changer since I bought it and haven't listened to the original album either.  It's pretty amazing--like discovering you have a non-identical twin brother after 28 years.    Frankly, the alternate take on the "I Want You" vocal is not my favorite, but all the other shadow versions are improvemements in the sense that they're looser and jazzier than the originals.  Highly recommended for "I Want You" addicts.
