 I like this record a lot.  The first time I heard it, I was shopping for new speakers for my stereo.  The salesman at a high-end audio store played it for me, saying that it is a staple for demonstrating audio gear.  Which is to say, it's really nicely produced and has lots of interesting sounds across the sound spectrum.  He went on to say that 90% of the people for whom he plays the record go on to buy it.  So that is how I came to acquire it. Patricia Barber is a gifted songwriter, and the lyrics to her songs are clever, witty, and engaging.  So you might be wondering "why only four stars?"  The reason I withhold the fifth star is that Ms. Barber goes off on a couple of vocal tangents where she completely loses her way.  For example, on the second track "Mourning Grace" she sings off key for nearly an entire minute.  Frank Sinatra made an entire career out of singing off key, but I hope Ms. Barber does not continue to follow his lead.
