 This is a case of an album being less than the sum of its parts.  I'm a huge fan of kd Lang, and I've got a couple of Tony Bennett's CD's too.  T-Bone Burnett's production and the arrangements are top notch, so the recording sounds lush and beautiful.  But for me, the singers don't click.  It sounds like kd is holding back something, maybe trying not to upstage Tony, and Tony's voice is obviously past its prime.  Old Sachmo had a croaky voice too, but it was his trademark, not the effect of old age.
