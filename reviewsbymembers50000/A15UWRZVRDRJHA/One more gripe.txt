 Other reviewers have pointed out ways in which the 12cp falls short of the original 12c, so I won't repeat those.  My gripe is that the case for the 12cp is complete crap.  It's stiff and horrible.  It takes considerable force to stuff the calculator into the case, whereas the old 12c case fits like a custom glove.
