 ... but were afraid to ask your liberal economics professors!  Dr. Bernstein has written the book which bridges the gap between Ayn Rand's collection, "Capitalism - The Unknown Ideal," and George Reisman's magnum opus, "Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics."   This is a book which is both accessible and inspiring to the layman, authoritative enough for the scholar.    When Bernstein's "The Capitalist Manifesto" becomes a text at even a small percentage of America's schools, socialism/communism/fascism is done for.
