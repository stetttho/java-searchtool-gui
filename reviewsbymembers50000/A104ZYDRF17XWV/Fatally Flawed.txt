 An excellent idea, with a fatally flawed implementation. It appears to be a limitation of the midi controller - drums will fail to sound intermittantly.  Since this appears to be a design issue, an except from my request for support from Ion-Audio.com:  I have found a problem with my new Ion IED05 Electronic Drum Set - the drums appear to conflict, perhaps in the MIDI interface (update: definitely the controller), perhaps within the Alesis controller.   When playing the drums, a pad will fail to sound intermittantly (and occasionally, the whole system will mute momentarily).  I hope this isn't the first you've heard of this issue, and that a fix is available.  Of course, I've checked the connections, checked to be sure I'm hitting the pads squarely and in the center, tried swapping pads (though the issue affects all of them, not just the snare), etc.   If fact, I can often reproduce the problem by simply, repeatedly striking any two pads together, one a split-second after the other. When it happens, the second appears to mute the first, before the first fully produces a tone. ________________________  Until/unless this issue's resolved, you'll find the set a cause of repeated frustration, whether for learning, practice or performance.   ________________________  4/15/05 Update: after sending the kit back (twice), received a brand new replacement - which has the same flaw.  Ion Support did all they could - this is a serious design problem.  Final verdict - the Alesys drum machine seems to operate fine (triggering from a keyboard via MIDI, no drop-outs), but the trigger-to-MIDI device (an ION branded black box labelled iET01) must be the problem.  Perhaps an OK kit for learning, but fatally flawed in a way that lead to no end of frustration, and renders the kit unsuitable for performance.
