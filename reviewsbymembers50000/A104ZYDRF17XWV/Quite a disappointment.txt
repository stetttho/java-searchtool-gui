 This review is primarily for folks who aren't already Jim Jarmusch devotees.    I suppose it's clich, but, "I really wanted to like this film!"  A disappointment from start to finish. Too few meaningful moments separated by too much space and time. Little humor, charisma, even angst & edginess was in short supply. Sparse sets don't quite reach minimalist (minimalism would have been more forgivable).  For example, why have customer background noises (but no other customers)?  Running themes (e.g. cousins/siblings, self-conscious envy and nervous graciousness, vertical camera shots onto the tables) with no meaning.    If you're hoping for an insightful film, a good bit of humor, or a few really shining moments for one or more of your favorite actors, I suspect you'll feel as let down as I did.  Undoubtedly, hardcore Jim Jarmusch fans (and perhaps Cate Blanchett fans as well - hers is the one scene which shines a bit) will pick this one up, but I can't recommend it to anyone else.
