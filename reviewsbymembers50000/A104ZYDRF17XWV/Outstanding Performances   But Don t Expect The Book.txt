 Exceptional performances by the cast, headed by Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal.  Strikingly produced.  Just remember that this is not the book.  Those familiar with Miss Rand's novel The Fountainhead will note the  absence of many of the events and characters from the original.  Don't go  into the film expecting it to be just like the book, and you will find it  very exciting.
