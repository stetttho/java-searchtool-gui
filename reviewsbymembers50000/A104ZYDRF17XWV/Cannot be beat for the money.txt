 My favorite guitar in my humble collection.  The best guitar under $150 you can buy.    Don't expect great tuners, and the tremolo's only good, but not great.  And you're well advised to replace the stock strings and adjust the bridge before you play the unit for the first time.  Do expect very good sounding, hot pickups, smooth five-position pickup selection, solid electronics, and best of all, outstanding action from a beautifully finished instrument.  The Kramer Focus beats cheap Squiers & Epiphone's hands down.
