 I bought one to leave in the band's practice room (why not? the price is right!), so I could keep my Crate MX50B at home, hoping this generic 60-watter would hold it's own against a guitar amp & drums.  Nope.  Not quite.  This is a fine practice amp, but side-by-side against my main amp, I'd subjectively rate the power around half the Crate's 50 watts.  So the Crate will go on the road, and this unit will be my practice unit for home.  Which is fine, since the low end rolls off early (even with the Bass setting at 10, the lows just aren't there), it won't shake the walls (or bother the neighbors so much).  On the other hand, though the manual and face of the amp (which arrived with the "AXL" brandname/logo on it) call it a Bass Amp, Musician's Friend is right to market it for keyboards too - the highs and mids are sharp (a tweeter in a bass amp?  Heh.) and there's lots of EQ-ing options.  All-in-all, if you're not expecting what the competition calls 60 watts, and don't need a lot of low-end rumble, this is a steal of a practice or keyboard amp for the (sale) price.
