 An excellent idea, with a fatally flawed implementation.  It appears to be a limitation of the midi controller - drums will fail to sound intermittantly.<br /><br />An except from my (so far unanswered) request for support from Ion-Audio.com:<br /><br />I have found a problem with my new Ion IED05 Electronic Drum Set - the drums appear to conflict, perhaps in the MIDI interface, perhaps within the Alesis controller. <br /><br />When playing the drums, a pad will fail to sound intermittantly (and occasionally, the whole system will mute momentarily).<br /><br />I hope this isn't the first you've heard of this issue, and that a fix is available.<br /><br />Of course, I've checked the connections, checked to be sure I'm hitting the pads squarely and in the center, tried swapping pads (though the issue affects all of them, not just the snare), etc.  <br /><br />If fact, I can often reproduce the problem by simply, repeatedly striking any two pads together, one a split-second after the other.  When it happens, the second appears to mute the first, before the first fully produces a tone.<br />________________________<br /><br />Until/unless this issue's resolved, you'll find the set a cause of repeated frustration, whether for learning, practice or performance.
