 Alex Callinicos presents argument from the "eat your cake and have it too" crowd.  While critical of neo-Liberals, he argues from the same wrong premise, the notion that you can tie the hands of the producers of the world without throttling production.  His chief complaint is not that Capitalism doesn't produce, nor that Capitalism doesn't improve the standard of living for everyone.  Rather, Capitalism improves the lives of the poor less than it improves the lives of the rich.    This only makes sense if you think that there's another way to go.  Callinicos cannot, and despite attempts, does not, make this case.  No one can.  With each turn of the page, I cannot help shouting, within the confines of my own critical mind, "but Capitalism is the best (and only) way to do it!"  The "second way", socialism/communism/fascism doesn't work.  And the "third way" is just a mix of the power of the first with the poison of the second.  I recommend Dr. Andrew Bernstein's The Capitalist Manifesto as antidote.
