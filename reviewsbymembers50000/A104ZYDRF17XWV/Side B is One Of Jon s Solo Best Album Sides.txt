 While Side A of this early 80's release has Mr. Anderson once again trying to write short, pop-friendly music, it's much more listenable than the later "The More You Know" pop-attempt.  Even "Heart of the Matter," with lyrics like, "as long as we can get inside the back of your car," is fun - frivolous, but fun. For the Yes fan, the real glory is to be found on Side B.  OK, that's a vinyl reference (and how much better the graphics for this release are in 12" format ... envy me, you youngsters!).  There's no real "sides" to a CD, but you'll feel the difference right away when "Everybody Loves You" plays.  Break-all-the-rules chording, beautiful session work from his hired band, happiness and hope in lyrical, melodic optimism.   While "Take Your Time" might be disposable, "Days" is a thoughtful, beautiful piece. But "Song of Seven," the title track, is the one for which you want this recording.  This is sweeping, dancing, tears-in-your-eyes music to rival any other Jon solo work.  All of Jon's work takes a (very) open mind, and in this case, we have his infant child baby-talking in the background while one of the kids recites simple arithmetic for the fade-out.  But what happens before then is glorious.  A song in several parts, with drama (!) and sincerity, with Jon's wide, sweeping lyrics, always open to interpretation, anything but mundane. It's this climax which puts Song of Seven properly in the category of Yes Music.
