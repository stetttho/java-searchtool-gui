 Powerful Stuff! For inspiration, motivation, and outright fun, it's hard to beat Heart Of A Pagan by Dr. Andrew Bernstein. If you're looking for a good basketball story, it's in there.  The soul of a champion?  Meet Swoop, the self-made conqueror of the b-ball court.  Overcoming obstacles?  You'll find a couple of the best role models in contemporary literature.  And Heart Of A Pagan is perhaps the best advocate of the unity of the mental and the physical, of the Greek ideal of a healthy mind and a healthy body. But what makes this book unique is the strength with which it delivers the message that the proper object of reverence is Man at his highest and best.  The characters of Swoop and Diggs in Heart Of A Pagan stand as reminders of our own highest aspirations.  Not since discovering Howard Roark in Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead (highly recommended!) have I felt so strongly that too-rare reaction: a combination of joy and immediacy, that I want to be and can be, have been and will be, a hero; just like them.  I recommend this book to men and women of greatness everywhere - and all who aspire to join their ranks.
