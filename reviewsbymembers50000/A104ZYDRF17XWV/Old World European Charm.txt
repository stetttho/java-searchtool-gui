 I've recently rediscovered this gem from the 70's.  What a treat! Happy, often joyous, alternately somber, tense or exciting melodies, and stories, yes, stories!  Far too richly-produced and fully instrumented (with the able assistance of Alan Parsons, experienced from his work on classics like Abbey Road and Dark Side Of The Moon) to be called folk music, Al Stewart spins historical and personal tales with the best of the folk singers. One warning - these are songs that may inspire you to fill your own life with adventure! Though many regard Al Stewart as a folk/rock singer, no folk music fires me up like this!  Highly recommended.
