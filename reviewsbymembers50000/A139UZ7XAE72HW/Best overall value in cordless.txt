 If you need all the bells and whistles, look elsewhere.  If you need the features that most people need and actually use, this is a great value.  For the most efficient layout, easiest programming, best quality of construction, best sound, best package of features. I've had Sony, At&T and Panasonic cordless phones, and none have provided the overall value and quality the Tru346 has.  Since I spend several hours a day on the phone (home office), I've hooked up the Plantronics M-175 headset, maxed out the volume, put the phone in my pocket, and enjoy mobile and hands free usage with excellent clarity.  Enjoy.
