 For healthy, nutritional, quick, low mess cooking, make almost any dish with a steamer.  This steamer is mid range in terms of quality of material and build.  It isn't the El Cheapo department store variety that is held together with metal staples, bound to end up in the trash can after several uses.  With proper care, this steamer should last you several years.  Soak the new steamer in cold water for a few hours when you first get it.  Always store in an open air place to prevent mildew.  Clean up is a breeze, just wipe with a paper towel, or if needed a quick dunk in soapy water and then rinse.  Steamers fit best on woks that are 2 inches larger than the steamer, therefore, a 12 inch wok would work best with this steamer.  Other than the recipe on the side of the box, there is nothing in the box other than the steamer.   You can cook or reheat your food by placing it directly on the bamboo, paper towel, leaves, parchment paper or by placing it on a heat resistant plate or in a bowl.  Also, you can add or remove steamer layers while cooking.  For even quicker food prep, if you're having noodles with the meal, you can cook them in the water in the bottom of the wok - a one pan meal.    Steaming is truly quick and efficient cooking at its best.
