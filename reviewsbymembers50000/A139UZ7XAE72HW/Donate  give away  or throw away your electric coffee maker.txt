 Using this french press yields an outstanding cup of coffee! Efficient to use, quick and easy clean up, very little extra time or effort from making your morning brew with a drip type maker.  This unit is well made, durable and fashionable. Consider purchasing this if you grind your own beans and like strong coffee that is of consistant and high quality.  Unless you have or are going to purchase a quality coffee mill, don't buy this or any other french press...you'll likely be disappointed at the results. I recommend the Starbucks Barista Burr Grinder (made by Solis) (...). The price on this 8-cup model doesn't deviate by more that a couple of bucks amoung retailers, so I bought at Amazon and if I ever need parts, I can buy direct at Bodum's web site.  As Bodum doesn't "outdate" their products every couple years like other mfg's, you should have piece of mind knowing that you'll not have to part with your french press if something tragic happens to it. Enjoy excellent coffee.
