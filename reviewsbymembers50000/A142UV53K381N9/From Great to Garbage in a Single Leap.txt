 Let's be completely fair about this. The first and last paragraphs in the book are as well crafted as anything this writer has ever done. I congratulate him for them. Unfortunately the 309 pages poured in between (hardcover edition) bespoke more the juvenile fantasies of Mr Robbins' possibly "chemically enhanced" lifestyle than of any kind of cogent narrative. Puerile sexual encounters more suitable for a school-boy's wet dreams and pathetic attempts at drama interspersed with one dimentional characters make this trivial book worthy of zero stars, except Amazon doed not allow for that.  A narrative, like a movie, should encourage us to suspend our disbelief and become engaged in the lives and trials of the characters. This contains enough detritus to ensure that our disbelief comes nowhere close to suspension!
