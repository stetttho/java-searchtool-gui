 I don't mind admitting it, I am old. Older than dirt. My Social Security number has only five digits -- get the picture? So I'm a fuddy-duddy. But I am sick and tired of Hollywood trying to tell me that "family entertainment" needs to include language that I never heard until I joined the military, and what they call "romance" has to look a lot like "s-e-x" to me.  Remember when Disney used to make pictures that you could take a 3 year old to, or a ten year old to, or a fifteen year old to, or all three to at the same time, without any embarrassment? When the bad guys were bad, but at a kid's level, and the good guys were good, but at a matching level? Well, it is possible you are too young to remember that, but I do.   And apparently Kieth Merrill does too, because that is exactly the kind of movie he has made here. Hollywoood mavens would blow it off as "fluff", but take a kid to see it (oops, little slip there, theatres probably won't show this one -- not "commercial enough") show it to a kid or two by way of your DVD player (there, that's better), and listen to the giggles and screams of enjoyment, and the calls of warning when the bad guys get up to something a bit nasty.  These are wonderful characters drawn close to life, but just a fraction larger than life (especially the bad guys). Villany sneaks around looking villanous, virtue does its own kind of sneaking, and, in the finest of fairy-tale traditions, wins out in the end. Old men in the audience wipe happy tears from their eyes.   And after it all, my feeling is that the more I see of films like this, the less I want to see Hollywood productions. Here is where true entertainment is to be found. Joyful and fun. No big message pounded out (although I suppose there is some kind of message about nice folks can win in the end in there somewhere) just ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. Get it, you won't be disappointed -- unless, of course, you're a Grinch!
