 I was surprised to read two recent "reviews" discarding this extraordinary book. Amazingly well written, considering that the author's credentials are based on his work for 23 years for the LAPD, including as detective on over 300 homicides. We can observe how he assembled the circumstantial evidence, step by step, and layer by layer. I note with interest that a recent Los Angeles DA states that he has built a compelling case.  But more than that, it is the content -- the way it unravels thread by thread. It has been many years since I have held a book in my hands that I literally "couldn't put down", until this. I have read until I couldn't stay awake longer (hey, I'm old, I get sleepy over anything). I wake at 4:00 am to do what old guys have to do at 4:00 am, and start reading again. A truly wonderful read -- albeit more than a little gruesome.
