 I note that one reviewer didn't like it because it spent too much time on showing the reader how to do things. Andy and Marcia (now husband and wife, by the way) have long been towers of strength in the CompuServe support Forums. This book shows their understanding, not only of VFP, but of us poor geeks out in the real world trying to figure out how to make it work. Structured code, good programming habits, and incorporation of OOP is here with us now, here to stay. Andy and Marcia guide the user into the methods of using these resources with example after example. I've met some people who can sit down and read a book like this from cover to cover before touching the keyboard. They are theoretical learners, and more power to them. I'm the other kind of guy. I need to get my mitts on the keyboard as soon as possible and try things out. This book is exactly what I need. At this moment it sits on my shelf with no less than 8 bookmarks in it. Andy and Marcia's influence may be seen through all my code. Ultimately, this 67 year old geek must thank Andy and Marcia for the fact that, at an age when most old guys are retired, I am still gainfully employed, and generously paid.  This is the best kind of bargain!
