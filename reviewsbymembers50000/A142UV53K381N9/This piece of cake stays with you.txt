 I read this book in 1993 when it came out. Having served for five years "in the ranks" of the RAF (1953-58) I was enthralled and enchanted by seeing so many of the people I had known, come to life. The  feckless irresponsibility of the young pilot officers having races down  mansion staircases seated on silver serving trays, the stubbornness of the  Wing Commander who held tight formations no matter how fatal ... real  people, real life. Perhaps to American eyes there are aspects of the  class interaction that may seem to be cariacatures, but they are not. The  chap who attended a "good" public school (means "private  school" in the U.S.) was accepted by his peers as a person "of  station", and his foibles were viewed as the right of the privileged  class. The poor erks (as we were known) were as far down the pecking order  as it was possible to be, and only longed for a condescending glance of  approval from those above us. Living, lively, if you want to know what  real war felt like, this book does it. You'll never forget  "Baggy" and his unfortunate demise.
