 I'll be candid. I'm not comfortable with novels that are splattered from end to end with salty language. Typically it bespeaks an author with little else to say. Oh, sure, I know all the arguments about "the feeling of truthfulness" in this scene or that, but unfortunately this scene and that don't become the least truthful with the use of the language. This preamble is for a reason. John Sandford's "Easy Prey" is littered with more language of the gutter than any such collection of such words I have experienced since 5 years as a rather young man in the Air Force. And it works. Beautifully. And for one very simple reason. Sandford can write. Oh, boy, can he write. Taught scenes filled with real people you can care about and get involved with. Dozens of characters, more than any novel I have read in years, and yet each fills an interesting, complete, and necessary part. Pretty good trick that. A simple phrase "She's gonna make it" pulses through the latter pages, and wrings at your heart a little time each time you read it. Tension? Plot? Honestly you can't predict what's going to happen next. He doesn't dangle the bad guy in front of you and tease you with it. Nope. He takes you through a thoroughly believable process of police investigation with its ups, its downs, and its dreary monotony of nothing happening. And even while he does that he makes his protagonist, Lucas Davenport human and vulnerable, and ... well, likeable! The final sentence in the book (no cheating by peeking now) is just perfect.
