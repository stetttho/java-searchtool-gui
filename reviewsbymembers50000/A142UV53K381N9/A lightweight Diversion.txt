 It's been a long time since I've sat down and read a novel all the way through in a short period of time. This one was given to me by one of my sons as a Christmas gift, so I decided to give it a priority.  I had hoped that the author's credentials as a lawyer might develop some underpinning of credibility for the story, but rather it seems that Mr, Martini might do better to keep his legal pad writing restricted to briefs in the courtroom.  Another reviewer suggests that the last third of the book might have been inspired by a visit to Cancun, a place which I have enjoyed, and I agree. One of the building blocks of any good novel must include the suspension of the reader's belief, and I fear that I found myself suspending my belief that Mr. Martini really was a writer.  He introduces characters the way that Emeril adds his essence to a stew with a sudden "POW!", and then lets them evaporate when it appears he cannot think of anything further useful for them to do in the plot. He permits murder and mayhem to splatter his pages with blood, yet at a moment when the book might have been mercilully shortened, a naughty razor wielding man runs away without helping us out by slitting the throat of our protagonist.  I'm not quite sure why I gave this pup two stars -- perhaps it's because of my fondness for Cancun, and Chichen Itza. To the best of my knowledge, if you stay at the Moon Palace, you won't get sprayed by gunfire from a two-man ultra-light aircraft. Can such craft even fly?
