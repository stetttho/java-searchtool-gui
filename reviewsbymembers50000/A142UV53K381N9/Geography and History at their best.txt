 When I was in school I was proficient in English, Math, and Science. However my reputation was based, not on these subjects, but on my utter inability to absorb even the most rudimentary amounts of information about Geography and History. Geography was locations, climate, topography, and not much more. History was worse: it was names and dates -- gobs of them. My test scores were so bad I once even had a -10 -- I misspelled my own name on the zero grade test paper. Onto this unpromising platform, then, imagine me selecting Blue Latitudes after hearing about it on Fresh Air, the NPR talk show. Sounded interesting, and Amazon.com's one click made it easy to get. I ensconsed it as my bathroom reading book at work, and its episodic structure lent itself to this task well. I don't recall whether it was the opening sentences of the book, or perhaps even earlier than that, the dust jacket, that grabbed me by the jugular, but Tony Horwitz, the author, did something amazing. He populated history with people, and by retracing the voyages himself, sometimes in a replica of Captain Cook's vessel, he populated the geography with life.  I gained a connection to the times, the events, the challenges, and the trials in a manner so remote from my school experiences, that I almost feel like a pseudo expert on Captain James Cook. I feel a dichotomy regarding his majesty as an explorer and cartographer (whose maps of New Zeaaland were still standard reference through 1995), and the net negative effect of his "discovery" of the South Pacific and its people over time. Tony Horwitz -- I salute you. You are a master story teller, and amaster of bringing history and geography to life!
