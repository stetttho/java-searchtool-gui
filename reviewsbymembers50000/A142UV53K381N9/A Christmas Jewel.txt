 Some volumes gain great literary prizes, wide acclaim, and huge readerships. Some are tiny jewels hidden by their giant cousins. This is a jewel. The beautiful story combines an elegant simplicity with an emotional  power that is quite extraordinary in today's writing. Quite simply a  Scrooge/Grinch story in a new wrapping, it breaks no new ground, offers no  surprising twists and turns in its plot. All it does is tell a beautiful  tale of love, loss, and redemption that will bring a tear to your eye as  you turn the final page. Highly recommended reading for all ages. Even  Scrooges and Grinches will enjoy it.
