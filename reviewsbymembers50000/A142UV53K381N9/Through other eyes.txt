 By now, thankfully, the history of the Holocaust and its destruction of 6 million Jews by the Nazi war machine is widely known. Less well known is the fact that there were German nationals who opposed Hitler's regime, and  who were subjected to equally brutal treatment. This book tells the true  story of three brash teenagers -- only 15 years old at the beginning -- who  dared to speak out against the Nazis by typing up leaflets and distributing  them. They were caught, tried, and convicted. Their punishments ranged from  death by the guillotine for the author and typist of the leaflets, to  multi-year prison sentences. In a touching and very moving way one of the  survivors tells his story of those events, the years of imprisonment, and,  finally his return to normalcy after the war. In my opinion, it would be  well for every teenager to read this book. It gives an understanding that  war isn't fun, bravery can be painful, and the indomintable spirit can  survive.
