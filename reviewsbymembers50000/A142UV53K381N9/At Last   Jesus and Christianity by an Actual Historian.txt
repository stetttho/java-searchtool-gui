 There is a fundamental failing common to books about Jesus that appears to be almost unavoidable: the author tends to bring personal religious prejudices to the process. Some seek to cause the reader to see Jesus in a particular positive light, and others strive to marginalize him as a mere speck in history, but throughout that, religious undercurrent is constantly running. Imagine my surprise, then, when I opened L. Michael White's extraordinary work From Jesus To Christianity and discovered that he managed to maintain his integrity as a historian. New Testament is used liberally throughout the book as a reference, but surely there is little else in existence that claims more authenticity when it comes to telling of the life, times and teachings of Jesus.    Starting with the trials and travels of Paul, Professor White analyses the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles. He examines the most likely places and times where various letters were written and why. He explains by the evidences and even the form of the structure of the individual letters the purpose, for whom they were intended, and even by whom they may have been carried to their destination.   Next he approaches the gospels in a manner you may never have seen before. For starters, he presents them in the most likely order in which they may have been written. Then he explains the geographic and social context in which they came to life.   Over all, this is the most extraordinary book I have ever read of its type. Professor White has created a volume that every serious student of Christianity should read carefully to get a clearer understanding of the time, geography, and the social setting in which the New Testament and all its stories came into being. As a practicing Christian, I personally found that this greater understanding was a comforting reinforcement to my personal faith.
