 This book starts off with real literary promise: "The heat was like a big old fat smelly mangy greasy farty dying dog that had settled down on London at the beginning of June and hadn't moved for three horrible weeks." Unfortunately that is the only truly literary flash in the entire novel. The problem with it is that Ms. French doesn't seem to understand character development. Her protagonists in each of the three sections develop quite well, but the peripheral characters keep going nowhere. She laces her plot with an obvious contempt for men as merely sexual users of women, and displays two of her protagonists as users of casual (unprotected, apparently) sex in a manner more suitable to the '60s than the 1999 time frame of the novel. She clearly has little idea of how the police work in such a case, gratuitously has a barely seen character arrested for murder with no mention of handwriting reviews, develops potentially interesting relationships and then simply drops them. All in all I think it would have been better if she had stopped writing after the first section, Zoe, and released it as a novella.
