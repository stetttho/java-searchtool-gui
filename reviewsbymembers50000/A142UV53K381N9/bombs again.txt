 In this pathetic effort the "good guys" are all"bad guys" gone good; Mafia types, IRA terrorists, Massadgoons. Officially sanctioned murder is the only solution to every problem. Nothing bad ever happens to the good guys, and everything bad always happens to the bad guys. There is no tension, no suspense, and the double spaced wide margined format has succeeded in squeezing 200 pages of mediocre text into nearly 400 pages. If you want to read Higgins at his very best, I strongly recommend Storm Warning, one of his less known earlier efforts. In that he engages the reader with three separate and distinct plot lines inexorably converging on a single point in space an time with no hint of the outcome until the very last. By contrast, this dud telegraphs every plot move, every outcome with the panache of a cortege of police cars with their lights and sirens in full action. These matchstick characters don't even enjoy the fire of emotion that was common in earlier efforts. Perhaps it is time for Mr. Higgins to try his hand at writing a cook book. It would have a more gripping plotline.  END
