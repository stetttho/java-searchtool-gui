 The combination of the brilliant and insightful mind of the former Chief Judge of New York State (and frontrunner for possible Governor), and his brutal dehumanizing experience in Federal Prison makes this book a "must read" for anyone who is concerned about this country's current "criminal justice" system. The opportunities that he made the most of to get to know people who were serving long terms for first offences, his insights into how the current sentencing guidelines have taken away the opportunity for judges to judge, and passed that authority over to the prosecutors is eye-opening. At the last, I was left with a helpless feeling for the total failure of the much vaunted "fairness" of our legal system. A realization that perhaps the greatest punishment isn't the incarceration, but the stripping of a person's personality, and opportunity to be a "normal part of society" upon release. Please read it, think about it, and ask yourself "Is there anything I can do to change this system?"
