 This hauntingly beautiful movie has stuck with me ever since I saw it on the big screen when it first came out in the local "art" theatre in 1997. Superbly cast, acted, directed and filmed, down to the finest detail, even the child, in my opinion was just right for the daunting task of the total story line.   In today's cinema the challenge of including nudity and sex seems to be something offered more for either the tittilation of the director, or for the hoped for prurience of the intended audience. It is usually justified by "being essential to the story line". Lo and behold -- in this film it actually is. The ensuing relationship between the governess and the laird could not be fully understood were it not for the well presented early scene aboard the trysting ship.  Perhaps the only oddity I found in the entire tale was the presence of the American character who appeared to have been inserted to meet some Union requirement, and had a slightly "hammer to fit" feeling about his presence. Otherwise I have often described this as the almost perfect movie.
