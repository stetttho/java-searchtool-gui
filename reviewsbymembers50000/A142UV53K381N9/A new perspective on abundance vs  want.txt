 This book reached me at a level few books ever do. It caught my conscience, it made me see things in a new light. When I sit down at a restaurant with a heaping plate of food in front of me it think shamefully  "this would feed a Cambodian village for a week". Was it seeing  the terror and horror of war through the eyes of a child that did it? Was  it the simple insoucience of the author that made every sentence ring with  pain and with truth? I don't know. But I do know that I have acquired a new  anger towards the senselessness of war, the brutality of rape as a weapon  of war, the insensitivity of nations to others where these atrocities  happen. Ung will reach you like that too. It isn't a pretty book, it  isn't a happy book, but the honesty and strength that emerge from every  page will hold you in a vice-like grip. You know from the beginning that  she will survive; after all, shw wrote the book. You will wonder how. You  will share the pathos of her sixth birthday which she celebrated by eating  a piece of charcoal, the agony of the moment when she took a small handful  of rice from a dying woman because she was so hungry herself, the anger of  the moment when she thought she saw the soldier who had tried to rape  her. A must read for anyone who cares about others.
