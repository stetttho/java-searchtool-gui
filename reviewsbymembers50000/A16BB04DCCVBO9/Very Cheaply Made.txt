 We have the same complaints as others... this game is sooooo cheaply made, especially for the price!! The marbles are light plastic and seamed -- they don't roll as well as they could. The hippos detach sometimes during play, one seems to not want to ever be attached. The levers get stuck sometimes, sometimes the balls get stuck in their throats. It is all very Flimsy. Trying to store it again is a joke.  That said, my kids still like it. It is unbelievably NOISY, and I think that's what they like, plus it's very fast paced. I would never play it with a very competitive child, they would drive you nuts complaining about how their hippo wasn't working right or whatever. The best part is flipping the balls into play with the springy thing, they pop really high.   We play on a carpeted floor, so the board doesn't move as much and stray balls don't get away too badly.
