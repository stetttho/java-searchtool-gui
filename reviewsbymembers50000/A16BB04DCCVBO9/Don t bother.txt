 Though Polly Pocket dolls are played with a lot in my house, the Wild Waves Castle was only used once. It is cumbersome when assembled, tippy, and doesn't work like it's supposed to. Because some water splashes from the slides, I put the base in a waterproof tray for play. Disassembled, it just sits there because it's not worth the trouble to snap it all back together again. This toy is an invitation for a mess of water on your floor and it's a pain to store.
