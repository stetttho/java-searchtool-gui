 I got this toy so my 4-1/2 year old and 12 month old would have something to play with in the kitchen besides the contents of my cabinets. They both love it! The baby can push the buttons for the songs and the 4-1/2 year old puts letters together to spell words (ones that don't need more than one of the same letter)! The 4-1/2 year old already knew her phonics but I wanted a fun way to reinforce them and start the spelling skills. The musical unit has been droppped and thrown with no ill effects, and one letter has been thrown in the bathtub. The songs are cute and not too loud. Because there are so many letters (the whole alphabet), the baby always has something to play with and nobody is fighting over the pieces. We love the Leapfrog products, BUT beware that almost all the toys ONLY teach capital letters. When the kids get to school you will find they want them to know their lowercase letters. So be sure to combine the great Leapfrog products with books or teaching of the lowercase letters too.
