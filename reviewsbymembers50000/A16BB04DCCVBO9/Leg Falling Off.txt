 I am very disappointed in the durability of this doll. The dress IS verrrry beautiful, although the "reversible" feature is sort of useless (my 6 year old could not figure out how to reattach the velcro after spinning dress around. The other dress is not quite as pretty anyway). But after only a month or so of gentle play, one of her legs is dangling out of its socket. I'm embarrassed to admit my daughter has roughly 25 Barbie dolls (many were second hand and very inexpensive though!), and this is the only one that has broken a joint. Perhaps they cut corners on the doll in order to use the more elaborate fabric on the dress? The doll was not inexpensive, so I expected it to last longer!
