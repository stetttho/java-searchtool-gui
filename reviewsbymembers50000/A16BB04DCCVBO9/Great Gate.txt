 I love this gate. We have a split level home with two sets of stairs going up, one set going down. I only bought two gates, but I bought two EXTRA sets of hardware (only [money] apiece on the company's website!), one for the downstairs family room (so baby can't go UP those stairs) and one for the kitchen. I easily move the gates to wherever I need them. For starting newell posts that don't fit any gate height, I bought a 3' tall piece of oak and stained it to match my railings. Screwed it into the newell, will just patch those tiny holes when the gates are gone for good, then installed the gate on that piece of wood. Got a thick (2") oak banister to screw into the stud for an area at the top of the stairs where the landing newell wasn't even with the wall. For top-of-the-stairs installation on ANY gate you need to screw into wood, not just drywall or it isn't safe. Now our setup is safe and it's pretty, since I stained the wood to match. I don't think you can stain the gate though, it has a safe, non-toxic coating on it and you wouldn't want to mess with sanding that off or anything.  Only drawback is it took several weeks before my 4-1/2 year old learned to operate the latch. I've actually decided the difficulty of the latch (it's not hard once you get used to it)is a huge benefit, because people or kids new to our house cannot operate it without help and thus leave it open, leaving a dangerous open stair.
