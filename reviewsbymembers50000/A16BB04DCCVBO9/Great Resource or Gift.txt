 I love these books. I had The Toddler's Busy Book, too. These books are the source of my most admired activities -- people are so impressed when they see a picture of my daughter in our indoor rice crispie "sandbox". (not all the ideas are that bold!) My daughter had immune problems as a toddler and we were housebound during the winter in a condo with no yard. I don't know what I would have done without these books! I love them so much I buy them as gifts for people. My best gift for a mom who is expecting who already has a child is this book (or the Toddler one if more appropriate), along with a rubbermaid storage box with individual baggies filled with some of the projects ready-to-go. During crazy times or when the older child is bored, she just has to pull out one baggie, I have copied the directions sheet and it is already in the bag with the supplies. My finest gift!!! And not expensive, either.
