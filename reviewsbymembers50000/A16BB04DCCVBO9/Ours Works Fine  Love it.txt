 I almost didn't allow my daughter to get this because of all the problems I read about here. But a friend down the street had it and hers worked fine, so I took the chance.  Ours works great! The clothes go on Polly every time. I don't know any magic secret, but DO read the review from the mom who took the time to write out better instructions than what came with the toy.   The only problem is the portability factor... it is conceivable that stuff could fall out the windows as you carry it around.  If you haven't had any Quik Clik Pollys before let me tell you, the Quik Clik clothes do not fit the regular Pollys, the rubber clothes of regular Pollys do not fit Quik Clik dolls. We don't mind at all -- the Quik Clik clothes are soooo much more fun to dress them with! Quik Clik dolls also do not bend at the waist (if they did, their clothes would pop off), but my kids have never even noticed this, they were so happy to have the fun quick-changing clothes. I like the happy little "click" the clothes make when they pop on! I just wish they sold some clothes alone, instead of forever having to buy new sets with more dolls.   Quik Clik Polly dolls will probably wear better than traditional Pollys -- we've had a few regular Pollys lose their heads, probably because of all the pulling involved with those tiny rubber clothes. Quik Clik dolls do not need any such manhandling... so their heads/necks get no wear and tear.   We love Quik Clik!
