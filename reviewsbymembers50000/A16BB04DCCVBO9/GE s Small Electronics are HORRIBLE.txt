 We have two different versions of this phone, both 2.4 GHz. The clarity, range and all of that have been fine. There are some features that are not good, like some annoying aspects of the caller ID listing that make it difficult to figure out who called unless the phone is still ringing, depending on the last time that particular person called.   But the main problem is that BOTH of my phones are now nearly impossible to dial out on. The buttons have become hard to push, then if you push harder they stick and register twice. In the Chicagoland area, even if you are calling next door you have to put in a "1" and the area code, then the number. Imagine how many times you have to re-dial trying to punch in 11 numbers when your buttons are sticking. The phones are clean, are dusted regularly, no sticky children ever handle them. There is no reason for this problem that I can determine.   My title is the result of being SICK of faulty GE products. Two phones are ready for the garbage, and they were not extremely cheap. I also owned a GE wireless optical mouse that worked for a whole ten days before it stopped completely. I will never buy another GE product.
