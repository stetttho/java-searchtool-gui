 This is a great concept... my 2 yr old loves Barbie and Kelly and this toy was a great way to encourage her to use the big potty (which she was afraid of) instead of just the little potty chair.  The doll served its purpose, it did take the mystery out of the big potty and give incentive to try it -- so I'm happy about that. BUT the "tinkle" feature of the doll is pretty much useless. It is really hard to get the doll to tinkle: you have to fill her to the brim with a tough-to-squeeze bottle, then push her tummy really hard (which just isn't possible when she's sitting on the lightweight potty because it will then tip over).  So we just emphasized how cool the big potty was and how Kelly liked it and was learning to use it, forced poor Kelly to endure some violent belly squeezes and oversaturation to try to get a few drops of water out of her just to make the point, then we put the ineffective "bottle" away and gave up trying to make her pee.   If I had it to do over again I would still buy the doll, but the tinkle feature is pretty lame.   As a side note, my 2 yr old was as mischievous with the play toilet paper as she is with real toilet paper -- unrolling it endlessly! :)
