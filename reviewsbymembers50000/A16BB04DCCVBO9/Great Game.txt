 First I'd like to point out that even if your child already knows his/her ABCs etc., you then use the "advanced" level of the game, in which you flip the cards over and there is something different on the other side. On the back side of the ABC/color cards are different pictures with a whole word written out in all lower case letters. This is great for repetition of reading skills and phonics. There is a different set of playing cards for the advanced version, all this is included when you buy the game.  My only gripes are if you do have to flip the cards back and forth between beginner and advanced on the "doors", they are pretty thin and can get bent easily, so I can see how you could really wear this game out. We use the "beginner" cards when my 2 year old is playing with us, the "advanced" cards when it's just my 5 year old and I (Daddy plays too, when he gets home from work).   Also, if you are not right above the board, there is the possibility of cheating by being able to see where some of the balls are. But that's not necessarily a bad lesson, either (learning to resist the temptation)!   Anyway, we just love this game and the very first day we had it, my 2yr, 5yr old and I played 5 games together, then my 5 yr old and I played 10 (count 'em, 10!!!!) games in a row during the little one's nap!! Wow! She would have kept going but we were sitting on the floor and my back was hurting!!! :)
