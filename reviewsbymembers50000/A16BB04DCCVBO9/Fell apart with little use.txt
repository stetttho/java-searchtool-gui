 First let me say my daughter LOVES this book. It works as a very nice nightlight, ideal because it gently dims and then turns off after a few minutes.  HOWEVER, ours broke within two months. It never left my daughter's bed, it literally was never dropped. My daughter is one of those very CALM toddlers, who doesn't bash stuff around.  Anyway, the moon went out and I opened it up and was a little annoyed because on the battery cover it says "Includes a replaceable battery!" Note the word "A". Which means ONE. NO, there are FOUR LL44 batteries in there. At Target, ONE LL44 battery is $2.99! That would mean to replace batteries you would have to pay $12 plus tax, when the book only cost $9!  So I wasted some time online looking for better prices for button cell batteries, then decided to scavenge from our other books with button cells. It was when I was replacing the batteries that I noticed that the little panel that meets up with the batteries (and sends their charge to the light) had broken off. Sigh. I have no earthly clue if it would be safe to leave in my daughter's bed if I tried to jury rig it. Frustrating.
