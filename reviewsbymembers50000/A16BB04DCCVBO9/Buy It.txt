 My MIL bought my daughter a Kettler tricycle, I believe at Toys R Us, for around $39. I was surprised and happy they make a Kettler trike in a lower price range, and it even came with a yellow bucket/trailer behind the seat for storing stuff. My daughter was 2-1/2 (she's small, too) and was not "getting" the concept of keeping her feet on the pedals, so I spent some back-breaking time leaned over, pushing her down the block on the thing so I could push and steer at the same time.   When I found out the push bar was only $16, I went for it, not even knowing if it would attach to the low-end model. IT DID!!! Right where the seat is mounted, there is a rounded-yet-triangular tubular opening, that's where the bar slides in. I was soooo impressed that all the models have interchangeable parts like that, what great design.  The best news is that within ONE DAY of me pushing my daughter with the bar (telling her to keep her feet on the pedals as I push), she was able to understand how to keep her feet on the pedals by herself and actually pedalled it herself!   The directions say not to use the bar as a lever to lift the trike at all, but I lift it all the time in order to correct my daughter's amateur attempts at steering! So far, so good.   This bar has enabled us to actually use our wonderful Kettler tricycle... it helped my daughter learn to pedal within one day, and has saved my back!
