 I was so excited to get this mixer. I bake alot and making meringues with a hand mixer is very tiring! Unfortunately, with the very first thing I tried to mix (french silk pie, nothing heavy), the motor that turns the bowl apparently burned out. The vertical part of the stand was VERY hot, but I didn't notice that until the thing konked out. My mother purchased this online from another store, and they better take it back! I want a refund, I don't want to risk disappointment with another lemon from Sunbeam.
