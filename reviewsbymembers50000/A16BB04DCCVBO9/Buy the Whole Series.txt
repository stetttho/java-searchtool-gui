 My 6 year old is an advanced reader, but I wasn't sure she had the attention span for chapter books. She loves rainbows and fairies though, so this series was a perfect start. There are a few line drawings on the pages to distract from the fact it's a chapter book, and the stories in the series are engaging. There are also some "cliff-hangers" at the end of some chapters that have even ME clamoring to read on! After wondering if chapter books would seem too daunting, it was exhilarating to reach the end of a chapter and have no doubt we'd just HAVE to read on to see what happened! To me, this is one of the great joys of reading.  We took it slow the first night, with my daughter reading one page, me one page, then her one more page (her idea) and off to bed. As an avid reader, I am proud to say that the next day when she awoke, she brought the book downstairs with her and sat on the couch and read the rest of the book by herself! That's the best testimonial I can give. This experience has sort of initiated her into the world of reading something other than picture books... I have a feeling other chapter books will not seem daunting to her now.   This is a great series to get girls interested in reading. I'm glad we bought all three available books at once! She's almost done with the third book and can't wait for the next.
