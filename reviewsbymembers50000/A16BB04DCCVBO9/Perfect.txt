 Note- my unit says it's a Bissell 3Way Lightweight vacuum, but it looks like this picture and was $19.99, so I believe it is the same product. I LOVE it!!!  I have two small children who seem to be increasing their crumb-dropping habit recently. I sweep crumbs into the corner of the kitchen and dining room (both hardwood) every day, but don't always have the chance to use the dustpan right away, plus you can't pick up every last speck that way. I am sick of sweeping and stooping!  So I found this little beauty and it is soooo much better than I expected! For $20, I figured I was taking a chance... but it works REALLY well! I leave on the roller head (as shown in pic) for floors and it's so light I pick it up and roll it across the dinner table as well! I slip the roller head off to get in the tighter corners, I use the crevice tool for the space between the carpet and walls in the halls. It's like a dustbuster on a stick, but since it plugs in, it's more powerful. It fits between my fridge and the wall with that sad, lonely old broom!  It is not a replacement for a big vac... I use my big, heavy Hoover for the plush carpet, but it's great for little touch-ups on the carpet. It does not, however, do great at picking up fuzzy carpet balls that are stuck to the carpet. It picks up beads better than my big vac (which sometimes spits them back out), it picks up crumbs, pieces of cereal, it even picked up an intact teddy graham with no problem.  The motor sounds very tight, smooth, like it will last. But I have not had it long, I will post again when I have more info on longevity. My only complaint is the plug isn't tight in the socket -- any pressure at all pulls the plug right out. I suppose if it's too annoying I can bend one prong slightly. I do wish it was easier to wrap and unwrap the cord since I'm using it so much! A retractable cord would be perfect. But for $20, I'm more than thrilled with this product.  Buy it, you'll like it!
