 This phone does not deserve one star, it deserves ZERO. The phone only works for 55 to 60 seconds before the call is cut off. Studied the manual, re-registered the handsets, changed channels and security codes, the works. Called tech support, and they say it must be interference from electronics nearby. Our old phones worked just fine sitting on top of the computer hutch and within a few feet of the microwave (which is where the jacks are, so we had no choice), so why couldn't these? They suggested another room. Ridiculous that we can't have a phone in the family room or kitchen, but we tried it. Didn't work in the bedroom, either. Of course not, there's a CLOCK in there!!! Seems like the phone thinks it's too far from the base (even when you are standing right next to it). Absolutely worthless. I sure hope Home Depot takes this load of junk back! Never again will I buy ANYTHING without checking reviews first, no matter how good the sale price!
