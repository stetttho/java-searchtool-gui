 We love this game. I always loved Memory as a child, and am so glad to have found such an appealing version... most of the ponies are so pretty!  There are lots and lots of cards, so what we do is each pick several pairs of our favorites. So we start with a sort of "matching" game, both the 2 yr old and 6 yr old enjoy it. Then we lay out the game (way less than the total # of cards) and have fun trying to get our "own" cards (the ones we picked), our favorites. When we don't, it's a great lesson in sportsmanship. This method eliminates any problems with similar looking ponies, though I agree maybe it's almost a good thing to have to pay close attention to detail. Besides, most kids could probably name each pony on sight, regardless how similar they look to each other! It's an unfair advantage for the children! :)
