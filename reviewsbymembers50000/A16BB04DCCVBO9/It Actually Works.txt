 Those Polly people are amazing. I don't know how they figured out how to get this limo to DRESS a doll (or why!). My 7-year-old received this as a gift. When she showed me what it does -- you put the doll in the driver's seat with no clothes on (is that legal?), you delicately set up her outfit in the back of the limo (it's actually quite tricky to get the top part to stay on but my daughter can do it every time with some patience), then you push and hold a button while "driving" the limo forward. The doll slides back behind a curtain on her back and pops up fully dressed! I laughed hysterically the first few times I watched this! It makes no sense and it is hard to believe it even works, but it's really quite funny!!
