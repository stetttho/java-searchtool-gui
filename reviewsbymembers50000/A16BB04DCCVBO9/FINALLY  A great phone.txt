 After horrible experiences with GE and Uniden, followed advice of positive reviews here and got this set. We love it. Sound quality is excellent, range is excellent.  LOVE being able to listen to answering machine messages from the other handset! Speaker phone function is great for having the little one talk to relatives -- that way you can "translate".  Answering machine is good -- easy to use. In fact, everything about the phone is common sense, they have made everything so easy that you can just figure it out without the manual. Caller ID listings are as you would expect, showing up in chronological order (previous GE phone would boot a call's info back to the first date that person called, making it nearly impossible to figure out who just called).  My only complaints are minor, the set is still way more than well worth these little hitches. Your outgoing message is not as clear as on other phones. I would love it if the "talk" button was bigger or a different color than the other buttons. Also, if you answer a call on one handset, the other handset will still show that as a "missed" call. No big deal, just not perfect (otherwise, I would have been happy to give five stars).   Overall, VERY happy with this set.
