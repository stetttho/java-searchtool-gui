 The rhymes in this book are very awkward. Here are some samples:  "Sweetberry will make you a cake or a sundae. It doesn't matter if it's Tuesday or Monday."  "Sparkleworks knows you can always be more, if you only let your imagination soar."  re: Pinkie Pie, "She's always asking, 'How?' 'Why?' and 'Who?' But you'll make her jump if you shout, 'Boo!'"  And other similar cringe-worthy rhymes. Don't get me wrong, I usually love children's books, especially rhyming ones. But it bugs me when the rhymes don't have the right flow. There are "Barney Numbers" and  "Barney Colors" books that rhyme sooo nicely. We also like "Rumble in the Jungle" and of course the KING, Dr. Suess!
