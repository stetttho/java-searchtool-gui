 My 3-1/2 year old daughter received this as a gift. I was skeptical, thinking she might be disappointed if she only got 2 puppies, but she got FOUR and was thrilled!!! They are really cute, too!! Everybody that sees her pulling the puppies out of the tummy is surprised at how cute they are. It's really adorable. She loves it!!!   Overall, I'd say this toy is much cuter and much more fun than I would have imagined!
