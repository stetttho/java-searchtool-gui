 My daughter got the whole set -- this part, plus the two little pools and their dolls which are each sold separately. I was afraid they wouldn't work well together, but they work great! It is all set up nicely so the side pools re-fill this main pool and the whole thing just keeps circulating. Pretty neat! We put the whole thing in a plastic serving tray to avoid possible splashes or any overflow.
