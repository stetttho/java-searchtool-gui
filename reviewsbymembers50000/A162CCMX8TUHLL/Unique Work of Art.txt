 Pierre Bensusan's "Guitar Book" is simply one of the best guitar books ever published. Virtually all of the pieces from his first 4 recordings are transcribed in very accessible format. All in tablature, mostly his preferred DADGAD tuning. In general, the pieces are arranged from easiest to most difficult, and most are accessible for an intermediate player. If it were just about the transcriptions, this would certainly be an extraordinary work. However, the "extras" take it to another level. Poetry, art, cooking recipes fill in along with some of his thoughts about playing the guitar. This work is truly distinguished from other guitar publications. Obviously, this book is not for a mass audience, but if you like Pierre Bensusan and play the guitar, you simply MUST have this.
