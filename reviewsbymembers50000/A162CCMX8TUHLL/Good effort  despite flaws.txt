 It's hard to give this work a negative review, because it's a decent effort. However despite it's size, it's too short :) The info seems to reflect the editor's Eurocentric point of view: there is decent coverage of  World Cup and Euro events. Latin American coverage is very weak, and  Asian/African virtually non-existant. Also, it seems a bit too heavy on the  very recent past. While this is understandable, it also can be annoying at  times. For example, under "Great Players", most current decent  players are covered, but many older ones omitted. And there are some  glaring screwups: Jordi Cruyff, who hasn't done much, gets a writeup, but  Berti Vogts, one of Germany's best ever defenders, capped 96 times, World  Champ, etc. is only mentioned as a coach. I'm sure you could find plenty of  other glaring faults. But rather than harp on all the problems, I will say  that it's a useful addition to a soccer fan's library. The strengths  outweigh the weaknesses.
