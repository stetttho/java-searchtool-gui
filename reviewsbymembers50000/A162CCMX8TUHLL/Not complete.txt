 (...) It would appear that judging from the list, about 4 songs are missing off the American issue. I bought the CD in Spain (release from Discmedi Blau), which is a double CD, and has 18 tracks. Among the songs apparently missing is an 11 minute version of "Gallaecia Fulget", which is one of the high points of their concert. Judging from the list of included songs on the American release, it should still be decent, but somehow I would feel ripped off if I had bought the American release and then later stumbled upon the Spanish issue.
