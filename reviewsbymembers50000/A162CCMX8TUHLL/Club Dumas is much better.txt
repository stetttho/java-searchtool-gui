 I was a bit disappointed with this book. It started off promisingly enough, with the "mystery in the painting theme", but once the focus moved to the "chess game", it lost steam fast. Some reviewers have complained about the chess emphasis, on the grounds they really didn't have enough background to follow it. Coming from the other side, i.e. I do play chess, I found much of the chess aspects to be at best annoying, and at worst, ridiculous. The game itself is almost an impossible position, and the "moves" are ludicrous. All the chess "experts" in the book have no clue on how to play chess whatsover and would constantly make laughable judgements about chess in general, and the game in particular. Now granted, the emphasis of the book is not to be an accurate representation of chess, but rather a mystery. But can you imagine writing a book where baseball is the central theme, and basically not knowing much about it, but then pontificating in your writing to the point of annoying anyone who understands or has played the game? I guess I got to the point where I was so annoyed about the chess aspect, I just wanted the book to be over, and didn't care who the murderer was. And given the fact that I was thoroughly enjoying the first few chapters, that is a sorry way to end things...
