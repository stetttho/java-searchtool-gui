 I really like this book. Despite a slight tendancy to ramble, Berkowitz style is very enjoyable, humourous at times, and he explains everything in detail. This is a book geared towrds understanding the concepts of routing  and switching, rather than analyzing everything from the manufacturers  viewpoint. As a result, you get a firm understanding of the fundamentals.  Where appropriate, he does discuss manufacturer specific design/philosphy  (e.g. cisco, nortel, etc.), but for the most part it's completely  independent of that. Hence, this is useful regardless of what gear you're  using. This is a must for every network engineer's library.
