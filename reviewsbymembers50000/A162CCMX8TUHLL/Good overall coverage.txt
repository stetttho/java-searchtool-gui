 This book is well written and easy to read. It appears to be geared towards intermediate level users, and it does a good job in catering to that audience. Beginners will be lost, and CCIE candidates already know the  stuff. His approach works quite well. He always starts with a simple  network and lists the configuration. Then he introduces a deliberate  misconfiguration and walks through the logic of how to recognize the  problem, e.g. you get to see the results of misconfigured subnet masks. At  least half of the book is oriented at troubleshooting ip routing protocols,  IGRP/EIGRP/OSPF/BGP etc, so if you're not looking for that, it will  probably be of less use. There are chapters on Trouble shooting Data link  layers, but you won't find stuff on appletalk, vines, sna etc.  Nevertheless, this book seems good for folks that already have some  experience or for advanced users that want a quick review of common  problems. For me, it was money well spent, as I actually did read it from  cover to cover. That in itself is worth something, because all to often an  author gives complete coverage, but the material puts you to sleep. This is  a book that you'll actually read.
