 This is truly an excellent work, with decent profiles on all 92 clubs in the Football League. The clubs histories are well written, and the extra details (e.g. good pubs, internet sites etc.) are in the usual dry-humor  style of The Rough Guides. There are better books on individual clubs, but  you'll be hard pressed to find a better one that covers all teams,  especially if you're in the US. This is a book for soccer FANS, far removed  from the usual "Clever Soccer Drills" or "Whoopee! We won  the Women's world Cup!" drivel that waste space on the bookshelves in  most US stores. I highly recommend to anyone who is interested in the  English game; this is a "must-have" for your soccer library.
