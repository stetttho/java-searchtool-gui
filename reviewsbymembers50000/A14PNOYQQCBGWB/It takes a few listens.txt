 Ranging from the sublimly intelligent to the adolescently stupid, St. Anger is a tough pill to swallow.  It deviates so far from what Metallica fans expect that it leaves them saying 'what the  he** is that piece of shirt I just listened to?'    It's kind of a 'return to their roots' thing combined with the benefits of their life's intelligence.  Metallica has changed as a musical force, as a band, and as people; accept it, this cd reflects those changes.  It's hard, it's heavy, it's loud; but Metallica doesn't care about what the mainstream thinks anymore, they don't cater to nobody but themselves...and that's how it should be with all artists.     St. Anger is worth the chance, it takes a few listens, but, if your a person with depth it's worth it. If your looking for the same old same old, skip this one.
