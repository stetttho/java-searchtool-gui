 The music may work wonderfully in the movie, which is what inspired me to get the Soundtrack, -but by itself, it just cant stand up. The music was designed for the film, and it performs it's task magnificently. But just to listen to, its not that great. Don't fault Michael Kamen, he did his job here and then some. Fault whoever produced this CD, the person who left many vitally interesting musical moments completely off the soundtrack.    In other words, unless your still drooling over the movie version of X-men, save your cash.
