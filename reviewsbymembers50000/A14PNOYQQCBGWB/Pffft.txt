 To everybody who wrote a review before this game came out, a heartfelt 'bleep' you.  Wait till you've played the game before you review it.   Brute Force is boring.  Plain and simple.  Despite some very well thought out ideas employed to control a group of characters and a mulitude of different weapons, the game has almost nothing in the way of a storyline, mission briefings are just intermissions between shoot outs, and weapon effects are painfully lacking; especially for a game on the most powerfull console on the market today.    Enviorments are good, occasionally very good, but they are constantly re-used and get old real fast.     Do yourself a favor, save your time and money and skip this one.
