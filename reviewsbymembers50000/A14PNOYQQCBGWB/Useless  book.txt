 The writers and publishers of this guide should be ashamed. There is nothing wihin its pages that can't be found out by simply playing the game through.    My primary reason for buying this guide was to find some of the things I missed before and discover new secrets.  -Not only does this accursed guide NOT describe any of those things, it's actually completely in error in some of its descriptive points.     The only thing this guide does do is provide you with a very basic walkthrough; which is completely useless to anyone intelligent enough to play Wizardry 8.      So...I've plunked down my cash for this piece of trash, now what? -Guess it's time to go out and get myself a puppy...at least this guidebook will make a good chewtoy; it's nice and thick, chock full o' pictures with their descriptions-for some idiotic reason-placed on the previous page.
