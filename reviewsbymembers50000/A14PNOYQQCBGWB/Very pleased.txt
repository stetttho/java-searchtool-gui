 Just got this monitor after my 17"'er keeled over and so far, it's great. It's got great resolution and excellent color at every screen setting I've tried. Dot pitch is .27x.25. Adjusting the monitor settings is very simple and intuitive, though getting the screen just right requires a bit of patience if your a perfectionist about it.  Only flaws of this monitor are 1)The name 'Perfectflat' is somewhat of a misnomer. The screen is not perfectly flat, though it is VERY close. 2) The power button requires a bit more push than most (due to the depth of its travel)- a minor gripe, and one that the user will get used to.   Another good thing though, is that the E90 has a nice flat top. -A good place to stick small notebooks and whatever else (that's important if you've ever had the misfortune of dealing with a rounded top monitor)  Overall it's a great monitor. Can't say much about it's lifespan, I've only had it a few days, but Viewsonic typically has three year warranties on their products, so I'm not all that worried. If your looking for a high quality, economical 19"er, this is it. Just make sure you got enough deskspace for it.
