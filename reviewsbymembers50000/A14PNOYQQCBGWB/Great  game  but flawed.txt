 Blood Omen 2 boasts incredible graphics, great scenery, well designed enemies, an excellent combat and ability system, a great base story, and some of the most frightening images ever to grace a game.     Unfortunately, it also boasts plot holes big enough to drive a truck through for the Legacy of Kain series officianado, ridiculous glitches that have no place in games of today; like enemies backing into, or falling dead into, walls, and the inexplicable inability to toss enemies into bodies of water. And then, like every LOK game, there is the puzzles. An incessant barrage of them that makes the player go temporarily insane and wish the game would just GO and stop with the mindless throwing of switches, dropping of blocks and moving of objects.      Still a great game, Blood Omen 2 does not, however, live up to the excellence of its predecessor,or even come close to the incredibility that is Soul Reaver, but it is a definite buy for LOK fans.     -Oddly enough btw, gamers who have not played any of the other LOK titles may enjoy this one a bit MORE, if only because they can't see how little sense some of the story's aspects make.
