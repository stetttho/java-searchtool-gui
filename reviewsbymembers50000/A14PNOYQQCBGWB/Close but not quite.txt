 If you are a long time player of Mech games, then heres how to gauge MW4: If you loved MW3, you'll hate (or at least be very dissapointed with) MW4. If you hated MW3, than you'll love MW4. There are many intelligent improvements made in MW4, but ultimately, the look and feel of the game is painfully cartoonish and hard to take seriously. The actors portaying the storyline fall far short of the mark in conveying the intended drama of the story. Missions are fairly interesting, music is superb (composed by Duane Decker, who also did the soundtrack of the MW3 expansion 'Pirates Moon'), terrain detail is astounding, and the early lunar missions skyline is awe inspiring; But despite these pros and a few others, MW4 just doesn't deliver the impact it should. As far as this pilot is concerned, Mechwarrior 3 is king of the battlemech games, even though its not perfect either. If your thinking of MW4; save the cash and spend half of it on the MW3 that comes with Mechcommander Gold and Pirates Moon(...). But dont take my word for it, look at some pics from 3 and some from 4; Then choose your mech...to each his, or her, own.
