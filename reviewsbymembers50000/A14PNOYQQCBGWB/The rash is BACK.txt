 Jailbreak, without question, rocks. Poppin' wheelies over cars, pounding your competitors off their bikes at 130mph. Wow.    Jailbreak gives you several different modes to play: The escaped con, the cop, or the dual player, fun as heck sidecar feature. -They're all a blast.    Bike to bike combat is exquisite, requiring just enough skill to feel proud when you pull up beside somebody and beat them silly, but not so much as to drive you insane. What you say? You want wrecks? Jailbreak's got 'em to spare.    Wiping out in this game is half the fun. Slides flips tumbles rolls and human flight can happen at any turn.       -I've spent almost as much time laughing with friends at wrecks as I've spent winning races.     Alone or with other players, this game is pure, unadulterated fun.
