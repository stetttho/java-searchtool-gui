 Though a bit old, MW3 is STILL the best. The Campaign is fun, great overall mood and atmosphere, combined with two tracks from a little known music group known as 'Twisted Tenderness', 'Haze' and 'Make it happen'. -The music is limited, but darn good.    The REAL fun of MW3 is online gameply, where you must outplay, outgun, and most importantly, outdesign your opponents. The mechlab, where you go to customize your multi-ton 'mech', is admitadly unrealistic, allowing the player to place multi weapons on a mech chasis obviously not made to have certain weapons in certain places, but it's also one of the most enjoyable aspects; with it you can place insane amounts of misilles or the dreaded Ultra autocannon 20 on each arm or torso side.    It takes a bit of ingenuity to outwit the many other oline players when it comes to design, for design is ultimately what kills or gets you killed. -to do so you must balance weapons, armor, armor type, chasis type, engine and equipement to devise the most lethal mech you can...and hope it's better than your opponents.   The unfortunate aspect of online gaming is, of course, the lag factor. Often you must shoot several mech lengths ahead of your opponent to actually hit them, which can be very annoying. But if you can suppress your ego long enough to master this irritatiing quirk, suffer many defeats, and learn what it takes to survive the online world of MW3, it is awesome. The array of different weapons and equipment at your disposal, the stunningly beautiful mech chasis in your arsenal....I've owned Mechwarrior three for over two years now, and I know I will always come back to it for more.    To summarize: The campaign is more than enough to justify buying this incredible game, especially at its current price tag ... , and the online gaming rooms makes it worth twice the price.  Currently, Mechwarrior three is only played on two gaming services that I know of, Gamespy, and the more popular MSN gaming zone. -And to further compliment the online experience, there are maps, called 'icemaps', which reduce your weapons heat to nearly nothing, readily available from different websites. They add a very fun aspect of insane destruction to you gameplay, helping you to obliterate your enemies in a few well placed shots.        In short, Mechwarrior 3 ROCKS and always will.            On a related note: Sadly, this game is hard to find, and even harder to find is it's expansion pack, 'Pirate's Moon', which gets a rating every bit as good as MW3 from this Mechwarrior.        Now, man your mechs and prepare to dominate the battlefield.......
