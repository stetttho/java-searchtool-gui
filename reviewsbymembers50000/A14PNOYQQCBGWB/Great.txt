 I've had this stick for about two years, and it's been great.  I've yet to come across a controller that fits so well in the hand, with throttle controls so easy to reach, top and bottom buttons so intuitivly placed...it really is the best I've seen.    It gets a star off however for durability of service.  After about a year I had to take it apart and do some rewiring, and a few months later the rudder control became unstable (as noted by other reviewers). The rudder control regained some stability over time, but never came back to perfect.  What finally killed it was the throttle control wires, already repaired once, let go from use. (this is, understand, after many, many, many hours of Mechwarrior 3 games, in which throttle is constantly being moved).   The wiring is very thin and difficult to salvage, so I said my goodbyes to the faithful controller, and have come to get a new one. :)
