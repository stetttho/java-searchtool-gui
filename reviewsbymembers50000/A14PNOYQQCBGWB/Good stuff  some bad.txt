 The Good: Defiance is incredible. The world it's set in, the characters, the complex plot. The graphics are simply awesome, the sound is mind blowing (and somewhat frightening when Raziel is in the spectral realm).  The puzzles were well thought out, decipherable with a bit of effort- most of them involve the reaver in some way. Along the way there are some really awesome surprises for long time LoK fans, and, at last, the ending is satisfying even if it leaves only a partial finality. The Bad: First off, if you've never played any earlier Legacy of Kain games, at least pick up 'Soul Reaver1' and gain a rudimentary understanding of the plot...because it's a twisted knot. The worst thing about Defiance is the camera angles. Ugh. The camera angles. They cause you to get confused, fall to your death, back into enemies, not see important things, fall off ledges-etc. Even after gaining a working understanding of it you're still annoyed by it. One last bad, hidden in one of the goods: Defiance is much more combat oriented than earlier LoK installments, and implements special combo moves you attain with combat experience. The're fun to use, but after awhile you get sick of using the same set of moves on opponents.    Summary: The best Legacy of Kain since 'Soul Reaver'.  Playing both Kain and Raziel on their entwined paths and facing their fates is enthralling.
