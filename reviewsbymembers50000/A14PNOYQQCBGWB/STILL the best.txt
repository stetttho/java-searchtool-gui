 Clan Smoke Jaguars days are numbered, the inner sphere is in the final stages of crushing the aggressive clan, and you will lead one branch of the final assault.     The operation plan is simple: Multiple lances will deploy from dropship to the planet Tranquill,  the last bastion of Smoke Jaguar power. Lances will engage multiple objectives, destroying the military might and production capabilities of clan Smoke Jaguar.       At least, thats how things were SUPPOSED to go.      Mechwarrior 3 and it expansion, Pirates moon, is one of the, if not the, best battletech game ever produced.  Graphically it is a wonder to behold.  Overall mood is dark and gray, with accompanying music to fit (composed by the little known group Twisted tenderness), very rarely will you see the sun shine on Tranquill.       Terrain variety is magnificent, a gamer could not ask for much more.  You will see caverns, arctic plains, fortresses, cities, tunnels, gorges, rivers, lakes, mountains, and even one really cool statue of the clan Smoke Jaguar insignia (Its off the beaten path, so dont expect to find it the first time through).       Gameplay is as good as any of the big robot fighting games, the only thing missing is hand to hand (ermech to mech? You know what I mean) combat weapons. All weapons are ranged.      Your arsenal of weapons include lasers (normal, pulse and extended range), Particle projections cannons, machine guns, flamers, long and short range missiles (as well as the exceptionally guided streak short range missile, which is more of a medium ranged weapon),the gauss rifle (a long range, accelerated slug), Autocannons, LB-X autocannons (kind of a shotgun type cannon), and ultra autocannons (the graphics on the UAC20 is awesome).       There is also a long list of equipment, including anti missile systems, ECMs, and targeting and guidance systems, among other things.       Critical to success in MW3 is heat management.  Weapons and engines generate heat, and you must deal with it to avoid overheating, shutting down, or blowing yourself up.       All in all its a well thought out system, with only a few irritating quirks.  Foremost among them is the ability to place almost any weapon anywhere on a mech, which doesnt make much sense, but its also this quirk that allows the player to construct killer battlemechs. And construction talent is just as important as piloting skill in MW3.  The construction system utilizes a combination of weight and critical spaces, with different types and amounts of armor, engines and internal mech framework.       Pirates Moon (Mechwarrior 3 Expansion, or MW3X), adds a good deal to the game, and is arguably better.     In MW3X you play Conner Sinclair (Babylon 5 fans raise your eyebrows here, he even SOUNDS like Michael Ohare), lanceleader assigned to guard mining operations on the barren planet Veil, which, true to the games title, happens to be plagued by pirates at the moment.      MW3X adds new dimension to the game, with good mission and in mission narritive, a touch of humor, more realistic damage reporting, and new terrain types.  Magnificent, planet filled, star strewn skies, depthless chasms, towering cliffs, mining rigs and impressive bases all await the player on Veil.  Pirates Moon also adds some very cool new mech chassis and weapons, not to mention music by Duane Decker (composer of the music in MW4 and MW4X), and enhanced terrain detail.     MW3 and MW3X are beautiful games, the campaign missions are very enjoyable, with enough replay value to entice the player to run the campaigns again about once a year at least (Ive had MW3 going on 2 years, and run through the campaigns and least five times). In MW3X there is an added bonus, you get to play as the bad guy, Scourge the pirate, and there is a surprising bonus mission as well.       But.where MW3 and MW3X really shine is in online gameplay. Currently two gaming services support these games, that I know of, Gamespy, and the much more popular MSN gaming zone. You can also connect directly to other players via IP address or direct modem connections. -Which have advantages over utilizing networks like MSN gaming zone and Gamespy, mainly, considerably improved lag factor.  MW3 and PM cause such delay in damage info between players that you are forced to shoot several mech lengths ahead of your opponents to hit them. Lag factor on the Zone is pretty bad; On Gamespy its better; but IP address and phonline connects are the best (well, almost the best; I cant speak for Broadband use. All I can say about that is broadband users destroy me completely online. Unfortunately its not a level playing field; heavy lag users are harder to hit, while good lag users seem to hit me more easily :( ).       PM has seen very little online action since Ive owned it, but thanks to the infogames re-release, its finally getting the attention it deserves. (And I cant neglect credit to those currently promoting it so it well, the GIMpoid group). One of the reasons for PMs lack of popularity stems from the many third party multiplayer maps available for MW3, including maps that cover the whole world of Tranquill and ICE maps (maps that allow players to almost ignore weapons heat build up).  When PM first came out, it was stated that use of MW3 multiplayer maps in PM would be possible eventually; But, thanks to the fall of FASA, and Microproses uncertain fate, that transference was never properly supported.  My own inquiries on this matter with infogames has resulted in We do not support modification of our games. Luckily, there is at least one MW3 map making pro out there who may be working on this in the foreseeable future.          To summarize this thing: get this game; it was the best when it first came out and it still is.
