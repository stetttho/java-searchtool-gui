 And swore I never would be. Most of its offensive and all about about biatches and dollars. And some of that's here in House of pain, but simply put, this cd rocks. Great riffs, lyrics and rythmm. House of pain has made me break my oath, 'cause the're good. If you like Kid Rock, you'll hear a lot of where his style comes from here; I'll be spinnin' this cd for years to come. No doubt.
