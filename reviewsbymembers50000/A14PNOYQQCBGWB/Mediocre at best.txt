 Bushido Blade 2 is fun, with a realistic fighting system and easy control functions, but at this stage in the world of video games, it just doesnt measure up.      There is very little storywise, which is a shame because with one it could have been a great game.  The character dialouge is possibly the worst ever written...and not even some very good (and fairly well known) voice over actors can salvage it.   So what you get are sections between fights with main characters where there are short CG movies with really poor dialouge and almost as bad animation.      Replay value is just barely there. Even with a fairly large character selection, once you've sliced and diced your way through the game a few times your ready to put it down.      On top of all this is the fact that the game has become rare and pricey; the game is fun, but not worth the price.
