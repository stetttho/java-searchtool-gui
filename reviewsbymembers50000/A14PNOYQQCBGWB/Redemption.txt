 No longer are you cast in the role of a weakly portrayed character. In MW4X things are as they should be: Only the strong are worthy of piloting a mech. Now you are a member of the Black Legion mercenaries- battle hardened one and all and tough as nails. MW4X follows its predecessors proven formula for success: New mechs, new weapons, new terrain, new scenario. And just like MW3X 'Pirates Moon',in MW4X you experience a richer enviorment, superior portrayal of the games characters, and brand new audio tracks that work very well with the story.    Basic graphics and gameplay are the same as MW4; Good but not incredible (I've never heard of a long range missile that can do a 180 in the flick of an eyelash, and still cant believe a 100 ton robot can stand on such skimpy legs like the Daishi or Madcat MrkII). The real improvements come in character portrayal, storyline, and enviorments.     There's some new enemy vehicles to deal with that make things interesting; wait 'till you get a gander at the MODLS and static defense platforms-very cool stuff.     You'll see ice crystals,mountains,craters,lava pits....enviorment is a very strong element in the futuristic realm of Battletech, and MW4X takes this into consideration. Not as strongly as it should, but its an improvement over MW4.     Storyline is thouroughly satisfying, with plot turns that induce you to help,or kill,whoevers involved.     After MW3, I hated MW4. MW4X is redemption: It fixes the poorly concieved characters, dufus villians and weakling heroes of its base game(Did I mention you get to KILL many of them?? Muhahahaha! -Ah,true vengeance), adds genuinly cool characters, superior music, interesting story, and improved enviorments.      It's still not as good as its predecessor,but it's a little closer.
