 My first CD from Aine Minouge was 'Between the worlds', and it will forever be one of my favorites, but 'The mysts of time' simply did not live up to expectation. Simply put, its a matter of tastes. If you like your celtic music light and easy, this one's for you; if you prefer more somber, mood driven tunes, turn your attention to 'Between the worlds'.
