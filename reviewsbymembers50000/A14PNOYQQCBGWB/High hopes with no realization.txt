 I had high hopes for this modem, Creative labs is a name I trust, being the same people who created the Sound blaster line of soundcards. Alas, this modem simply did not work. It is a V90 modem, but it doesnt act like one. Every blue moon I was able to actually connect to the internet using it, and when I did the connections always were around 33,333bps- nothing fantastic. After hours of frustrating attempts, including checking and rewiring some of my homes phone lines, I ended up removing it this modem, putting my old one back in, and then proceeded to get consistent, very fast, first dial attempt connections that averaged around 48,000bps.     Maybe it just wasnt built for Windows ME (even though my computer acknowledged its presence and functioning status), maybe its simply outdated. Regardless, save your money for something more functional and up to date. -Already V92 protocol is becoming the new standard of dial up modems; if your buying a new modem anyway, may as well get the latest technology. I'd rate this modem a negative three stars, but the rating system doesnt go that low.
