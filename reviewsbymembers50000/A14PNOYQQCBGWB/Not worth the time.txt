 A good action game if ever there was one, but deplorably tedious and time consuming. Minor enemies can spell your doom, and boss's can drive you insane. A game that entertains and challenges would be welcome; Ninja Gaiden is just a hard game without equivelant reward, and not worth the time. I got about halfway and decided to say 'nevermind this shirt'. -Bear in mind I was really looking forward to this game, being a player of Gaiden from waaaay back when it was an arcade game.    My distaste for the game being spoken, I have to say that it does LOOK great. Graphics are top notch. -Can't say much that hasn't been said already here....wish it was better than it is, rent it before you buy it, and hopr you enjoy it more than I.
