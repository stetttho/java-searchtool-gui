 DOA3 looks great, it's graphics are incredible...and if that was all it took to make a great game this would be one, however, that is NOT all it takes.     There are a lot of moves to learn in this game; all of which are nearly useless: because by the time you've entered the button sequence your opponent has mashed you into the floor with stupid button smashing, rendering all your hard work useless.  Eventually the player always comes back to simple punch and kick combos, making gameplay completly without depth.   Then there's the story and endings...hardly any of which have a point or even make a little sense.   The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because it's enjoyable to change the female characters cloths and look up their dresses when their throwing high kicks.      If your a more serious fighting gamer who enjoys utilizing a characters moves and combos, go somwhere else; DOA3 is almost a  pure button smasher.
