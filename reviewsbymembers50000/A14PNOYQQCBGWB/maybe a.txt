 The graphics of bloodwake are dutifully impressive for an Xbox title, but if your looking for the level of raw carnage that 'Twisted metal' provides, dont look here.  In campaign mode your character is Kai, a Naval captain whose squad is splashed by his own brother. Fortunately for Kai, pirates happen upon the scene and pull him from the waves toward a shaky future. So of you go, initiated into the 'Shadow Clan' pirates. The story unfolds from there, never quite being exceptional but never making the player roll their eyes in disgust either. In other words, it's ok but dont expect it to 'WOW' you.      Gameplay takes a bit of getting used to; your boat rocks and rolls with the waves, reactes somewhat sluggishly, and is difficult to control in reverse.  But after you get used to it all, it's fairly entertaining.  The player unlocks an array of different boats as they proceed through the game, with an arsenal comprising torpedoes, chain guns, autocannons, cannons, rockets and mines. Unfortunately though, you can't choose which boat you'll use in a mission, it's always an assigned boat.  Most missions are fairly straightforward: sink enemy. -But there are a few nice changes of pace along the way. That being said, some of the missions are extremely difficult on any difficulty level above beginner, and cheat codes are a must have for the last three.  -Hats off to anyone who has beaten them without a cheat.     All in all it's a good game, but not great.  A fun 'once in awhile' game. And it's a good choice for it's current price of [money].
