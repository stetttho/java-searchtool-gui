 Outstanding! This one should get Ten Gold Stars. It's probably  one of the most focused recordings Prince has ever done.   Brutally Honest, Funky and Spiritual. Not your average piece of art work, is it? If you Hate this one, then you really should hear SlaughterHouse. Ha! Let the Haters Hate and the Players Play.
