 Who died and made the Beatles the model for psychedelic records? If truth be told this record is by far better and more complex. After the major success of Purple Rain, Prince pulled a fast one on the pop scene and moved full speed ahead with ATWIAD. Elements of all kinds of music representing a myriad of cultures abound on this recording, hence the title. With lyrics that include religious thought, politics, sex, utopian views, heartbreak, lust and drug use, just to name a few, this is one of his best. The climax (no pun intended) is Temptation, which is probably one of the most intense songs he's made regarding sexual over-indulgence. I don't recall hearing anything that deep on Sgt. Pepper.
