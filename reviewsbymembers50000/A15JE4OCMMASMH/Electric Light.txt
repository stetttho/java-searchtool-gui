 This is an excellent DVD of Miles' Electric Period. To anyone who knows anything about Miles's music, from KIND OF BLUE on thru the sixties, his going "electric" was not some stunt to sell more records. It was the natural progression of an artist who didn't give a shhhh about following standards. He was true to himself. He created and moved on with each period up until his passing when he was beginning to deal with rap music.   It was great to see all the original musicians and it was also funny to watch stanley crouch, a pseudo-intellectual critic who couldn't get or understand Bitches Brew, even when he used drugs. That in itself shows that he has absloutely no real connection to the sprirt of music or creative artistry.  The concert was off the hook!!
