 In 2004 this movie is still too provactive and progressive for some people,(Hence the weak apologia at the beginning of the movie, inserted to downplay the strong political tone of the film). Yet it should be required viewing for all of us. Written Produced, Arranged, Composed, Directed and Financed by us. That's the ONLY way we will ever see real strong images about African-American people on the big screen.
