 Wynton Marsalis does an excellent job of capturing the feel of the music created during the early 20th century. It is a very good intellectual interpretation of the music that was popular back then, it captures the sound of an era, but not the spirit.  If you want to get inside the mind of what Jack Johnson was feeling when he reigned supreme; The dark chaos, beauty,and fiery Black braggadocio, then get MILES DAVIS' Soundtrack to an original Jack Johnson documentary that came out in the early '70s. At only two tracks its the only true interpretation of Jack Johnson's story, with guest vocals by actor Brock Peters as JJ. FIRE!
