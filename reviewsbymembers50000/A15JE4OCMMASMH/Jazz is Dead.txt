 This is a most excellent critical analysis of Jazz. Brutally honest and totally factual. This 35 minute film packs more of a wallop than the ENTIRE 10 disc Ken Burns Jazz documentary. The Ken Burns story of Jazz only exceeds in its rare footage of great Jazz men and their participation in the film.  The Cry of Jazz succeeds in its dramatization of a discussion between blacks and whites where the blacks participating in the dialouge actually carry the story rather than being the by-standers listening to whites tell our story. However, the advertisement of Sun Ra's name on the package is misleading. Sun Ra is only used during one segment. If you look at the state of Jazz today, it truly is in a dormant, dead state... Slayed by two Cosmic African Warriors, namely Sun Ra & Sir Miles D. Davis.
