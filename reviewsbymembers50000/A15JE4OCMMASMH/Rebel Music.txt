 Excellent. Sexy and Rebellious...and it's not just a gimmick. The music is close to electronic dancehall with chanting and repetitious beats that simmer with tribal flavor. If you don't get it, don't dis it. Definitely not for the squimish & scary... If you can't take the heat, holla back at Gwen Stefani. Mya is twice as hot and real as it gets. Buy this one.
