 Although the DVD version is not the greatest in terms of quality, it is still a very good copy of a great film. Finally, a parable that gets the story right. More passionate than the Passion or any other religious movie about Jesus. It correctly intertwines politics & religious ideology, showing that there really is no separation between the two, only invisible boundaries; Plus the fact that finally we see a BLACK Man playing the part, which is more accurate and true to life. Woddy Strode was great in the title character... although he is more known for his role in Spartacus.
