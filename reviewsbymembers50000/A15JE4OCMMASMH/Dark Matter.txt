 Universal Soul Music. Every track is great & stands out on its own but is also an intricate part of the whole 39 minute experience. I haven't heard a concept LP like this since the Rainbow Children. Me'shell is truly an gifted artist; true to herself and the music. It's amazing that she's so ignored. Maybe because she's the antithesis of all the R&Bull that's fed to the masses. Far ahead of her time, but right on time.
