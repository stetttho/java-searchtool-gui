 This is a beautiful piece of music. Timeless. Bombastic and understated melodies provide a musical vision of our solar system that is powerful and sublime...This version by Charles Dutoit is the best compared to the others I've heard. The standout tracks are Venus, Saturn, and Neptune. It's interesting that Holst did not write a piece for Earth. Given the atomosphere that he wrote it in, around WWI, he probably was seeking inspiration from the Neter world. And of course no piece was written for Pluto because it had not yet been "discovered" by western astronomy.
