 This record is definitely a statement as much as it is classic mint condition. It's a display of art that shows a classic group growing and branching out in the right direction. Split into 3 sections shaped by short instrumental tracks that seamingly lead us to the next change/exploration of styles is a brilliant concept... Im partial to the mid section but it's all good...   A lot of tracks stand out but in particular "It's Hard" with a touch from the brother's Aquemini and a Chip Fu rap that reminds us where Twista needs to pay his respects. It truly is hard to be original and these brothers, like DELA said are blowing up...but they won't go pop.
