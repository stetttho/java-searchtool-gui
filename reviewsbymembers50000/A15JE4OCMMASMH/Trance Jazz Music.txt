 Miles, once again is Miles Ahead with this beautiful almost futuristic Jazz with African overtones. It's a polyrythmic Jazz experiment that was never done before or after him for that matter. Although some of the melodies exist in some form or another on future releases culminating with Pangaea, this one stands out, and you can actually hear where Miles was trying to go with the music. So far ahead that the critics from back in the day who bashed this music is now giving this Black genius his due.    Just goes to show you that critics don't know shhhhh. They often say they love change but when a genius forges forward and is progressive they hate it. Most likely because they didn't understand what he was doing at the time. Plus the fact that Miles was cool as a MF and didn't give a shhhh about what critics thought.Thanks Miles for telling them to piss off and creating music that is now being revered as modern day classics while Columbia records stamps its Legacy imprint on your music.   Can you imagine if Miles would have capitulated and tried to duplicate Kind of Blue over and over again? He wouldn't be one of the most respected jazz artists today. And how in the world is the Rock and Roll hall of fame just inducting him in 2006? He should have been a first round draft pick.
