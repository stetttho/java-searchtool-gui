 Rarely do you have a rap group that's as solid as this one. Not one CD on the Billboard Top Ten right now can touch this release and yet, LB is not even in the Top Twenty. But no sweat, watch LB blow up real soon, and like De La, they won't go pop. I don't need to name a best track.. it's ALL GOOD.
