 Excellent. This record should have been released as a double album with the Black Album. They both compliment each other and they probably would have been held more highly as a set, particularly after the great 'Sign O the Times'. As usual Prince covers any style he feels like doing with ease.   Both records are inspired by the funk. Lovesexy just focuses more on the divine, as opposed to The Black Album's pre-occupation with Lust. The ongoing theme of the majority of Prince's music since day one.
