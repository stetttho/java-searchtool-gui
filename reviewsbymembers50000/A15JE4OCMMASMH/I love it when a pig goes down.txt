 Great to see a movie that portrays the racism that pervades police departments across this good ole USA. It's interesting that this movie came out around the same time frame as Training Day and was damn near swept under the rug and straight to DVD, but Denzel gets an Oscar for playing a criminal cop. Like Arsenio used to say...Things that make you go Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
