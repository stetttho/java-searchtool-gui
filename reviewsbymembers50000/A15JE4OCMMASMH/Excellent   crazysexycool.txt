 I have no clue why this movie never played at a theater as a major release. It is hilarious and has great performances by Salli Richardson, Robin Givens, and Treach (of naughty by nature) There are hilarious cameos by familiar black actors, comedians and artists, and it's finally giving the brotha's point of view when it comes to the topic of us all being "dogs". It's also an intelligent look at relationships without being too bias and the comedy doesn't reduce itself to buffonery. I say this one is better that Love Jones...I just hope it doesn't take almost another 10 years before another decent one comes out. Damn, I guess BET can make a good movie when it wants. I wish they would do more. Buy This one!!
