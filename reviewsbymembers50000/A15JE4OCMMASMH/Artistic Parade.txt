 This is one of Prince's best concept records, not as popular with the masses as his other great records probably because he continued going in a totatlly different direction as he started to do with 'Around the world in a day.' Parade put the nail in the coffin for all those waiting for Purple Rain II. However, a true artist doesn't follow the public's opinion, pop singers do that.  Parade is his most diverse sounding CD, yet is the most cohesive of his eighties releases. The songs flow from one to the other smoothly(tracks 1-4), which is the best use of segues between songs that I have ever heard on record, even the abrupt changes don't disrupt the flow. The CD covers so many different moods and styles but all songs fit into place, including the hit 'Kiss', that Tom Jones later completely destroys. To say Prince was experimenting with different styles is an understatement. He takes the overall influence of French themes, related to the movie of course, and incorporates them into his style. The French flavor is there as a supplement, not as the overall influence which makes this recording even more unique and one of his finest. Lisa and Wendy stand out on this record as well with some great background instrumentation and voice. The record is perfect and the sound is crisp and clear... not for the casual pop music listener.   And concerning the movie; it is a very funny take on early movies from the 40s & 50s. Prince & Jerome display a cool chemistry as best friends. However, if you do not know the style or are familiar with Black & white comedies from the early years of film, then you didn't get the point of the film, especially in the mid-80s; hence all the negative comments.
