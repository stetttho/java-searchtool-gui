 If not for this recording, artistic freedom probably would not have come so soon for Motown and many other black artists in the early 70s. It set the tone for political & religious commentary in music and highly influenced many such as Stevie Wonder, who followed suit and soon demanded his artisitc freedom, which led to his Innervisions LP.  But Marvin laid it all out, the pain and suffering, and faith of a man in a way never heard before. It's still amazing that Motown didn't want to release this record. It was only after Marvin threatened to never record for them again that Berry Gordy relented and released the record, which turned out to be a major hit.   Another must have for all; in particular Black Men.
