 While researching for an environmental book, we had the great good fortune to come across Myron Arm's wonderful story of the mysteries of sea and ice. In lovely, leisurely prose, Arms takes the reader to the source of one of  nature's greatest happenings: the unending collision between the Great  Ocean Conveyor Belt and the mad southerly migration of Arctic ice. This  epic rumination makes it incontestably clear that much of Earth's climate  is driven by the two frozen chunks of ice at the Northern and Southern  poles--both of which are melting at an astonishing rate. For me, the  unstated question Arms leaves us with is, "So what happens when,  within a hundred years or so, the ice sheets have melted so much that they  can no longer counterbalance our furiously warming Earth?" As a  planet, we better figure that out very soon.
