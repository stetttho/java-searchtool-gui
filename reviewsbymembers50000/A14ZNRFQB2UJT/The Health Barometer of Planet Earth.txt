 For finding the essential facts on the Earth's health and the path to a sane future, no series of books is as helpful, balanced and thorough as The Worldwatch Institute's State of the World annual reports.   We've just  completed a new book about the life and death of planets, Dead Mars, Dying  Earth, and have been reading and researching in the planetary biosciences  everyday for the last two years, so here's our advice:  If you want to  find out what's going on on Planet Earth the hard way, go to the bookstore  or the library. If you want to understand the clear and simple truth of  life on Earth at the Millennium, run out and buy a copy of State of the  World 2000.
