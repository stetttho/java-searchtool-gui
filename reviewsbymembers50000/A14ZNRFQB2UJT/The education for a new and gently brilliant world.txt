 This is the best childhood education book I have ever read. Since first picking this book up in the late 70s, I've read it again and again and have probably given away 50 copies to new parents and to educators. If you want  a plan to bring your children to golden wisdom, if you seek the roadmap to  unfold the mind of genius which lives in your child and in the children  around you, read this book. Then give it to your friends and relatives and  the teachers at your schools. In this you will know that, like planting a  tree, you've sent another messenger to that kind and better future we pray  for in our hearts.
