 Harry Moore and Fred Brown form a wonderful team as they combine their diverse talents to offer both the "over" and "under" story of Eastern Tennessee's spectacular fall colors. Brown, a reporter for the Knoxville News-Sentinel, provides the sonorous phrases which perfectly frame Tennessee's reddish, golden autumn foliage. Moore, a Tennessee state geologist, offers a unique geological perspective on the ancient geological features that define the lands that stretch from the Cumberland Plateau all the way to the Blue Ridge Mountains.  With Discovering October Roads in hand, those who wander Tennessee's fiery hills will have the opportunity to view them through a lens of wonder and knowing normally reserved for just a few geology and biology majors. Moore and Brown's book is a delightful, easy read that offers days of pleasure to novice and professional alike.
