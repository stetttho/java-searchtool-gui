 Inside the Yellow Submarine: the Making of the Beatles' Animated Classic is a remarkable combination of scholarship and love. Created out of the almost endless efforts of American writer, radio personality and muralist, Bob Hieronimus, Inside the Yellow Submarine pulses with the unseen vibrancy, conflict and ultimate triumph which give birth to every successful artistic endeavor. Even today Yellow Submarine stands as a groundbreaking work of creativity, playfulness and opalescence. When I first sat through it in 1968, I didn't know whether I'd been transported back to my preteen years or thrust forward into an unimaginably different future full of possibilities and hues I could never have otherwise imagined. But, like the Beatles' reality-wrenching musical odyssey, Yellow Submarine inexorably welcomed its viewers deep into a psyche of boundless possibility--a field of unlimited imagination which now lives freely in the everyday world and on the hard drive of every computer. In the same energetic as the movie's creators, Bob Hieronimus breaks hectares of new ground in his work. Combining artistry and the dogged research of a forensic historian, Hieronimus lets you into the ideologies and passions that allowed an underpaid band of stubborn artists to subvert a corporate monolith and produce one of history's great works of animated creation. Perhaps, in this dark millenium of unbridled, let-them-eat-cake capitalism, the lessons so boldly painted in The Making of the Yellow Submarine may point the way to a new era where we find a greater vision which can rout today's Blue Meanies and everyone can again remember that Love IS All You Need.
