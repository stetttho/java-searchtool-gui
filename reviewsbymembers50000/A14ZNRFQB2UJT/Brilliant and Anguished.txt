 James Carroll's book is a soul-searing atttempt to figure out what went wrong with Catholicism such that it could provide 1600 years of Catholics with the incendiary teachings they would need to ravage the Jewish race again and again and again. Finally it is a call to Christians to return to Christ's message and to rip away the 1900 plus years of distortions and political manipulations which have taken the teachings of one of God's greatest teachers and turned them into the often hateful hodge-podge of conflicted scripture and unloving judgments which define and deceive so much of the present day Christian community. Ultimately, it's pretty simple: If it's not about love , if it doesn't lead to loving action, then it's not Christ's teaching no matter how loudly some red clad prelate preaches that it is. Peace.
