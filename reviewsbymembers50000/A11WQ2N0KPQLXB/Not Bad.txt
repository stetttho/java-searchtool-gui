 Looking at all of the reviews for this book, I noticed that it was either black or white of opinions.  Either you loved the book, or you hated it.  I, personally don't hate or love it.  I think it was an exceptionally good book, and It could've been a bit more scarier.  I kept thinking of those little goblins from the movie "The Gate" the whole time I was reading the book.  I am not an avid Dean R. Koontz's fan (at least not yet) the only other book i've read was "The Servents Of Twilight" and I think that one is pretty amazing as well. The book is filled with voodoo and the power of good and evil.  The Detective Jack is trying to protect his children from a certain "Prince Of Darkness" who is trying to get to them through these little goblins.  The book is suspenseful, and is very fast paced.  There was some character build but not by much.  In the book, it was only about a day that this story took place, so within it's self, was very quick. Bottom line, i think you should read this book, it's cool, has cool characters in it, and a pretty good story line :)
