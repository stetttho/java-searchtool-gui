 I am a big fan of Stephen King movies, but I haven't read much of his novels.  This is only the second novel by him that I have read.  I found it a very simple and very exciting novel.  It's about a girl who gets lost in  a forest, but she realizes she is not alone.  It's very excellent and it  will take you only a day to read it.
