 Belinda Carlisle is MY favorite singer of all time.  I think she is one of  the most beautiful and one of the most talented person on earth!  Her songs  always brighten my days and always put me in a good mood with her lovely  voice.  These songs definetly cover her entire solo career (leaving out  "Mad About You" but this cd is a european release and that song  was not a hit over there)  from her #1 World wide hit "Heaven Is A  Place On Earth" to her recent single "All God's Children"  but between these 2 songs are some of the most impressive songs I have  Heard.  My Favorite songs on here are "Circle In The Sand,"  "Summer Rain" "We Want The Same Thing" "Do You  Feel Like I Feel?" "Big Scary Animal" and "Always  Breaking My Heart".  Although I Wish they had included other songs  such as "Runaway Horses" "World Without You" "Lay  Down Your Arms" and "Vision Of YOU" it is still a great cd.
