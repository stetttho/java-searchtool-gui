 I was a bit afraid to start this novel, after reading the reviews for this book, but since I wanted to know what happened between Ayla and Jondalar, I started it anyway.  It took me close to two months to get past the first 200 pages, I did not want to read it, I was sooooooo bored with it!! But I wanted to finish the series so I forced myself into finishing it.  Luckily, I didn't have to force myself too much, around the 300 pages into the novel, I got into it! I Do agree that the novel was like a prehistoric Soap opera with the love triangle between Ayla, Jondolar and Ranec, and I didn't feel that Jondalar had to be so jealous most of the time, and it took them 300 pages to resolve it.  I would've rather had Ayla ditched both of them and went with the Character from the wolf pack, who i cannot remember his name at the moment, but of course, with the formula of the novel, you know who ends up with her.   Character development was wonderful.  I did find it hard to remember all of the characters, though! I kept forgetting who was male and female! lol. My favorite part was when Ayla stood up to the people about Rydag, that gave me much joy to see how much the Lion Camp cared for her. But all in all, If you want to read the whole series, you should read this one as well.  I personally thought the book was a tad bit too long, to not really cover much.  But you can still skip this novel and continue on with "Plains Of Passage"
