 I have to say that this is one of the worst novels that she has ever  written.  I just didn't think that it was that entertaining.  After  finishing the book, I went out and rented the movie, and It is far better  than this novel.  I am sorry Anne rice, but I can see why you used a pseudo  name when you wrote this book.  It stinks!
