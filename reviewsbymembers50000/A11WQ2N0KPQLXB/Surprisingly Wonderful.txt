 I bought this CD for the only purpose... for the cool song "Kiss Kiss". I bought it used off of amazon.com because I was worried that would've been the ONLY song I would like on the album!! I was Surprised! This album is awesome! I can't believe Stella is so Underrated. I think if they used one of her more upbeat songs it would be a big hit... "Kiss Kiss" is wonderful, but it has a very european sound to it, which it seems like america does not like, which i love. But I don't care, i love "Kiss Kiss" KISS KISS: A wonderful song, and I love her voice. I think she has a cross between Stevie Nicks-Belinda Carlisle-Kim Wilde. Its very distinctive. PRETTY YOUNG THING: who was produced by Bryan Rawling (cher's Believe) and has that same type of sound to it. I think this is the next single. YOU: is a great ballad, nice lyrics IMPERFECT: this is an okay song, but Im sure it will grow on me. RUNAWAY CRUSH: has a very rocking chorus, its very cool. STAND UP: a very fun, dancey song! LOVE YOU TO DEATH: also a killer (ha ha) chorus. Its one of my favorite songs on the album. "I'm like a woman possessed..." ANGEL FACE: a little bit softer, but its nice to listen to. TWILIGHT: a very cool song... "Sugar Girl" LOOK MY WAY: It's definetly a Belinda Carlisle song.  From her "Live Your Life Be Free" Album, but it's still very much Stellas own. LET's JUST GO TO BED: I think this is an okay song, but not one of my favorite songs. DANCE WITH ME: Excellent lyrics, and is another favorite of mine. Just like one reviewer said, If you loved "Kiss Kiss" You will like the other songs on this album, and I agree... Check it out. you'll be glad you did, I bet.
