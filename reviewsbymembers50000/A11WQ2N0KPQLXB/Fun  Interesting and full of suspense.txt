 I had just finished this novel yesterday.  It was a very fun and interesting novel!  and wayyyyy scary!  The novel is about an alien who takes over a girls body and the people of this small town find out that  that is the least of the problems.  I am a big fan of Mr. McCammon's  novels.  It's the third one that I have read and I am definetly going to  read more.
