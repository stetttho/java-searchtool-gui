 This is my first Sara Evans CD as well, because personally i haven't heard her previous material (although I have heard of her before), but when I saw "Born To Fly" Video, it took my breath away... I couldn't help but relate to the song itself.  When I bought the cd, I was sceptical about it.  I thought i would enjoy a few songs and that would be it, but I take that back.  This has got to be one of my favorite cds in 2000.  I know that the songs have a pop feel to it, but that's what i like, i just hope she doesn't go "Faith & Twain" way.  The songs i enjoy are the title Track "Four Thirty" "Saints And Angels" "Show Me The Way To Your Heart"... Every song has a theme that i relate to... the songs are about normal everyday things... LIFE!
