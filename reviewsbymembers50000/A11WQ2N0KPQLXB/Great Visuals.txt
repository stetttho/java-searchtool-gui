 This is the first Barbara Kingsolver book I have read and I was definetly impressed!  I thought the book started out slow, but definetly sparked my interest after about 30 pages of the book.... It's about a girl who comes  back to her childhood town to teach and here she is about to unleash alot  of the memories that she has blocked out.  I really loved the characters in  this novel, I definetly give it an A.
