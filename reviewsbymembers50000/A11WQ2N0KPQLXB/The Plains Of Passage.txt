 As written in the back of the book "With her companion Jondalar, Ayla sets out on her most dangerous and daring journey- away from the welcoming heart of the Mammoth Hunters, and into the unknown." That sentence tells all about whats to come in this story.  There are some surprisingly good sections in this story, between alot of sex and scenery. My favorite part of the book is when "The Wolf Pack" comes in.  It kind of reminded me more of like "The Amazons" in medevil times.  Attaroa was the most twisted person mentioned in any of the Earth Children's series.  She has much, depth, pain and craziness in her.  She is one of the more interesting characters in this series. The Novel has some other good parts as well, but I think that over all this book is just a "Good" novel.  It was just about everything that I thought it would be.  I can understand why some people were upset that it took Jean M. Auel a long time to write her next addition to this series.  This one leaves you with a cliffhanger.
