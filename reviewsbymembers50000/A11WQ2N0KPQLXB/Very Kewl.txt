 This was the first horror book that I have read in along time.  And I must say "It is good to be back." The novel keeps you going, always wondering what's around the next corner.  I love the characters Christine is a very strong character, she is to be much admired.  Joey is a typical little boy, but you really wonder, could he be evil?  And Detective Harrison is a good hero, he always seems to get Christine and Joey from point A to point B.  I found the book very scary, not supernatural wise. But knowing what they felt like, being hunted.  I couldn't put the novel down I read it within 3 days.  I also watched the movie, which I do not recommend. This is also the first Dean R. Koontz book I have ever read, and I am also very impressed.
