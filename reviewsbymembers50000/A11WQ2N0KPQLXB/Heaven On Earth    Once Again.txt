 Virgin Records has yet again released another collection of Belindas work.  First of all, I know alot of bel fans aren't too happy about this, because it contains album tracks on it. First of all, I think it's awesome!! Some of these album tracks have not been remastered until now! There are some wonderful pieces on here that have never been fairely treated compared to her other solo work.  The hit songs such as the #1 hit "Heaven Is A Place On Earth" and the #2 US single "I Get Weak" as well as "Do You Feel Like I Feel?" "Summer Rain" and "Little Black Book".  Some of my favorite album tracks are "Love Revolution" "Fool For Love" "We Can Change" and "Valentine".  Each song is unique! I wish they did include some songs from "Real" on the album since it's a Virgin Records-Only album. So no songs From "Belinda" and "A Woman And A Man" are included, but the 2 new songs from "A Place On Earth" are included.  A nice photo inside as well as the discography mentioned :)
