 I've had this novel for the past year or so, But I could never get into it, so it sat there for months and months.  I was going through my books recently, and came across it, so I thought I'd attempt to read it again.  I must say that this novel is fascinating!! The novel is about a little girl who is separated from her Clan and is taken into another Clan who finds her barely alive.  The novel, I think, is about coming of age, and acceptence of ones self and of others.  I think it's about growth and basically life.  Ayla who is the main character in this novel, goes through many things.  She had her ups and downs with the clan of the cave bear, and it gave her an identity and independence that no one in that clan had ever had: least of all women.  However, this novel is brilliant, and it made me cry at the end.  I cannot wait to continue the series, and I will definetly write a review for the second, third, and fourth!!!
