 If you can compare this song list to the "Collection" THEY ARE not the same!! The collection is album-filler songs that were never hits with a few big hits on the CD.  The Essential is a re-packaged edition to THE BEST OF BELINDA VOLUME 1 which I had stated in the previous review that WAS Released in The U.K. in 1992.  "Her Greatest Hits" is a US Release ONLY.  I was referring to the UK Release if you were paying ANY attention!!   These are the songs: The Collection: 1. Heaven is a place on earth 2. I get weak 3. World without you 4. Runaway Horses 5. Summer Rain 6. Do You feel like I feel? 7. Little Black Book 8. All God's Children 9. A Prayer For Everyone 10.Fool for Love 11.We Can Change 12.Love Revolution 13.Valentine 14.Whatever it takes 15.Vision of you The Essential Belinda Carlisle: 1. Heaven is a place on earth 2. (we want) the same thing (summer remix) 3. Circle in the sand (single version) 4. leave a light on 5. little black book 6. summer rain 7. vision of you (91 remix) 8. Live your life be free 9. I get weak 10.La luna 11.I plead insanity 12.world without you 13.Do you feel like I Feel 14.Half the world 15.Runaway horses So... There are 8 songs that both CD contain... 7 DIFFERENT SONGS per CD.  I should know I have both of them!! So Belinda fans Judge for yourself & discard Shane Lowe's Review... He doesn't know what he's talking about... If you're going to say something & be correct then check all the Info first!! Now compare & YOU BE THE JUDGE :)
