 I had the opportunity to meet Anne Rice just recently at the booksigning of "MERRICK".  She is a very sweet and wonderful woman.  Everything that you thought she was, she is.  She cared about what books of hers that we enjoyed and how we Loved the "Interview" movie in so on.  Well anyway, this novel is wonderful!  I found it difficult the first 100 pages, but then again It seems like I always have this problem!  The narrator of this story is, of course, the wonderful David Talbot (Body Theif) and of his encounters and his life with the lovely Mayfair, Merrick.  He is telling Louis this story of what had happened in her life.  Louis is, of course, very interested because Merrick has the ability to talk to the dead, and of course, he would give anything to speak with Claudia again... The novel is well written in the ways of Anne Rice.  The story was brilliant and I was glued to the pages, as if reading into a journal of someone's real life!  Any Rice Fan will enjoy this book!  And also Lestat is in this one also!!!
