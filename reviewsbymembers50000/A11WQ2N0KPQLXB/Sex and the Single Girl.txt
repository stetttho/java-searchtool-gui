 Did you ever see that movie?  It was made in 1964 (or around) with Natalie Wood & Tony Curtis... It's very similar to this movie & i'm surprised that no one has compared it to this film.  I think it's more similar than the Doris Day Movies. Both "Down With Love" & "Sex" are good movies... Check them both out.  You can get "Sex and the Single Girl" on VHS.
