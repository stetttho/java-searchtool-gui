 How could anyone not be intrigued by sex, drugs & fame??? This novel has it all!  The story, of course you probably know by now circles around 3 women trying to basically climb Mount Everest, so to say.  I found myself staying up till all hours of the night to read this book, what a thrilling ride!  the 500 page novel took me less than 2 days to read, and my head was spinning, i was even dizzy! I just couldn't help myself the novel had such intrigue to it!  Its definetly one of the trashest novels of all time, but a favorite of mine and to others :)
