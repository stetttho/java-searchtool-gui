 I disagree with alot of the reviewers on here about this movie.  To me, this movie is one of the better sequels of ANOE.  True, it does contain more humor, and some of the acting is not great, but I think the story line was great.  I thought all of the praise should go to Lisa Wilcox (Alice).  She was definetly my favorite character.  Alice was kind of an outcast, who often daydreamed about how her life could be, or what she wished it to me.  And her character has an excellent development through this whole movie.  It's a more realistic movie than the other ones,  its about a person who comes to terms with their fears.  And I think they pushed it one step farther with the dreams, I love every sequel, some more than the others, but this one comes close to the very first, and after this one the third is my favorite...
