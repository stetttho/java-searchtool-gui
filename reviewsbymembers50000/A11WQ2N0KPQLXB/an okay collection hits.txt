 I just can't believe they only included 9 Greatest hits, and 6 mediocre new songs... Don't get me wrong "That's The Way It Is" "I Want You To Need Me" "First Time" are all great songs, but she could've done without the others.  Also the omission of "Where does My Heart Beat Now?" has definetly left this album feeling weak. Other hits missing: Nothing Broken But My Heart, Misled, Think Twice, All By Myself, Falling Into You, The Reason, Tell Him, When I Fall In Love. Highlights: That's The Way It Is, The Power Of Love, If You Asked Me To, To Love You More, My Heart Will Go On...
