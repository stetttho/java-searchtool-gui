 I loved every Anne Rice Vampire book, except for this one.  A word to the wise, save your 26.95 dollars on this book, if you're interested buy the cheap paperback cover.  This book is soooo vague, I couldn't believe it! I was so disappointed.  Vittorio didn't even change into a vampire until like the last 50 pages!  This novel reaked! I think Anne Rice should've took a little more time on this novel.  maybe she shouldn't write anymore Vampire novels.
