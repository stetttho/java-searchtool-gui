 I was a bit nervous about reading "The Vampire Lestat" because I got bored in the middle of "Interview"  I still love that book, but I was afraid that this novel would be like it, but it's not...  I  love "The Vampire Lestat"  it was a novel that kept me reading  for three days straight... It talks about his life before Louis and Claudia  and he talks about the present about he becoming a rock star who is on Mtv  and is about to perform in San Francisco... Another reason I loved this  novel is because it explained things that weren't mentioned in  "Interview" like the Children of The Damned, and The  "Vampire Gods" and so forth... It's an excellent novel... if  you liked this book, you'll love "The Queen of The Damned"....
