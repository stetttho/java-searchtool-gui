 I really loved this book.  I've seen the movie, before I read the book and I love the book a million times more than the movie.  You really get into the life of Carlotta (Carla in the movie).  You get flashbacks of her life from when she was a child, to her first and second marriage.  And the ending IS different.  This book scared me constantly while reading it, it kind of freaks me out to hear that it's based on a true story.  All in all, if you find a copy of it, BUY IT... it's now out of print, and worth your time for reading..
