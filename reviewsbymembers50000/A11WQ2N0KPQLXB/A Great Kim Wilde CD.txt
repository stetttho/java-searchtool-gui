 Kim Wilde is one of my favorite singers and I've had her U.S. Releases  (Kim Wilde, Teases and Dares, Another Step and Close) and so I knew the  songs that came from there.  I was a little disappointed as well because I  didn't know the other songs (like "Child Come Away", "Love  Blonde" and "Cambodia" I didn't really care for those) but  what I loved was the song "Love Is Holy" Ahhh... It's such an  awesome song!  It was written by Rick Nowels and ellen Shipley (the couple  that wrote "Heaven Is A Place On Earth")... I wish that some of  the songs from "Love Moves" was on there because it was only  released in the U.k.  I also wish that certain songs from her previous  albums was on there... like "Say You Really Want Me" "I've  Got So Much Love" "Love In The Natural Way" and "The  Touch"... Oh well, but I love the cover of "If I Can't Have  You" and I didn't care for the remix of "Another Step"...  that's all! :)
