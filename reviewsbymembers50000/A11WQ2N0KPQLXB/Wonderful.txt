 I remember literally calling in to work one day, because this movie was on. I missed about the first 15 minutes of it, and I just had to see what happened. I think Marilyn Monroe looked stunning, and I am surprised it wasn't a phenominal success. The movie itself has a wonderful-romantic story line to it. It's one of my favorite classic movies by Miss Monroe. The Story is about a Mother and Daughter dancers. Marilyn becames, forgive me if i dont' spell it correctly the "Burless" Queen and she meets a man who falls head over heels in love with her. Marilyns Mom is worried and confronts the boy that if he wants to marry her to please discuss it with his mother, so there isn't any problems.  If you want to hear what happens, I reccomend you rent or buy this video. Its a wonderful-witty little film that I think is wonderful!!!
