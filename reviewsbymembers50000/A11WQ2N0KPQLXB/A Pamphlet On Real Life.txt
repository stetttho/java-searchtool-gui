 "Bridget Jones' Diary" by Helen Fielding is hilarious!!  I found just about everything in this novel funny.  Although some of the slang, I did find myself confused on!! I definetly related to Bridget, even though I am a man! and am proud of have read this book!! I know what it feels like to want to lose weight, quite smoking or trying to get that certain special someone to notice you or the fear of being completely alone, forever!! lol. This novel is definetly all of that and a box of cigarettes!  And If you like the novel, you might like the movie, too! Check it out.  I can't wait to read "The Edge Of Reason"
