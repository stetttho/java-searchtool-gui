 I've read this book long ago, and i noticed that amazon.com was constantly wanting me to review it, so I decided to go for it. I think that this novel is very romantic, very decietful and very joyful.  Just like any V. C. Andrews books, they all seem to contain all of the above, which In my opinion is an amazing gift.  In this book, Heaven is growing into a mature young woman, trying to forget a past that had betrayed her, and looking into the future with her eyes wide open.  This is a great novel, and one of her more successful ones at that.
