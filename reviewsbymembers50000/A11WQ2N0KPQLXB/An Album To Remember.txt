 I've been a Cyndi Lauper fan for years now, but i've never really conquered listening to her full length albums--I just stayed with my "Twelve Deadly Cyns" and "Sisters of Avalon" CDS.  One of my all time favorite songs of hers is "I Drove All Night" and thats what drove me to this album besides "A Night To Remember" and "Dancing With A Stranger" From the "Wanna Have Fun" Collection.  So I was cruising through amazon and came across the reviews for "ANTR" and was intrigued, by a reviewer saying it was a heartbreak album.  and I knew it must be good, cuz On Cyndi's sad songs, she truly has an emotional voice. So I ordered the album: here's my review of the songs.. INTRO: See Kindred Spirit at the end. I DROVE ALL NIGHT: my favorite song by cyndi of all time!  It has such energy to it.  The lyrics are sad and yet romantic.  "Could Taste Your Sweet Kisses Your Arms Open Wide.  This Fever For You Is Just Burning Me Up Inside." PRIMITIVE: Kind of reminded me of the beginning of Madonna's "Like A Virgin" It's a really cool song though. MY FIRST NIGHT WITHOUT YOU: beginning of "Stand By Me" I had higher expectations for it, but over all it's an OKAY song. LIKE A CAT: Is a very cute, and very "Cyndi-like" song. HEADING WEST: another favorite from the album... It's so beautiful and sad... A NIGHT TO REMEMBER: Another beautiful sad song, about a love that never was. UNCONDITIONAL LOVE: is a totally amazing song, probably one of the best songs Cyndi has ever written. INSECURIOUS: IS a very cutesy song, but a very clever song. DANCING WITH A STRANGER: a very cool dancey song to listen to, I love the lyrics as well. I DON"T WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND: My last favorite song on the album, it doesn't even sound like Cyndi, but its a song we can all relate to. KINDRED SPIRIT: Is the full length version of the song to the INTRO.  It sounds like an old record with Cyndi singing this neat little verse. It's only about a minute long. All in all, i was astonished with this album... It's great, I can listen to all of the songs and want to play it over again.  They are not too long, they are all short and sweet.  Under 40 minutes.  I wish it would've been a bigger hit, and i wish Cyndi would sing more of the songs from there.  I saw her this year and she didn't sing any of them.  Listed on her "Thank Yous" she mentioned it was her best album of the time.  I wish "Hole In My Heart (ALl The Way To China)" was on it too, but I don't think it would fit in the album... Great buy!!
