 This Collection basically continues after "The Very Best Of Kim Wilde" that has been released in many, and I do mean "many" different formats, such as re-issues. The Collection dates from 1984-1995.  This is where you can see the growth in Kim Wilde as an artist. The New Wave is gone, and Pop Is In. The album opens up with "The Second Time" which I think is a totally hot number! It's very dancey and fun to sing along to. "Rage To Love" is another pop number, but I don't think it's that good.  "You Keep Me Hangin' On" kims biggest single, rocks the place with pain and anger. "Another Step Closer To You" continues and is the original album version, which I prefer over the single version.  The seductive "Say You Really Wants Me" heats things up. An extended dance remix of "Hey Mister Heartache" fits in nicely here. The single version of "You Came" with such soul and saddness, is a highlight on the album. The rocking "Never Trust A Stranger" which is more like a sequel to "YKMHO". The slow, and annoying "Four Letter Word". "Love In The Natural Way" is a very beautiful ballad and fits perfectly. "It's Here" an ok-song from her miss "Love Moves" as well as "Time" these songs are gems because "Love Moves" was only released in the UK and was a major flop. One of my favorite songs on here is "Love Is Holy" its a very beautiful up-beat ballad. The cheesy "Who Do You Think You Are".  The dance-disco-diva song "If I Can't Have You".  Along with her two hits from "Now and Forever" called "Breaking A Way" and "This I Swear" I know there are a few great songs missing here like: "Heart Over Mind" "Can't Get Enough Of Your Love" "In My Life" and "School Girl" but this album is spectacular, for those of you who just want her hits, I recommend this one and her "Very Best Of Kim Wilde" CD....
