 I loved this book! I thought it was an excellent move from the whole "Flowers In The Attic" novels... It was great... It's about this family who are basically hillbillies, who are poor, and the story revolves around the daughter Heaven, who promises she'll find her dead mother's parents, and make a life she can be proud of... such tragedy ahead, tears, & Abuse... It's a wonderfully written story... I recommend it, definetly...
