 I just finished "The Claiming Of Sleeping Beauty" which is the second novel that I have read by Ms. Anne Rice.  I must say WOW!  How did she come up with this?   If you're interested in sex or just how creative  she made from this fairy tale then this novel is for you!   There are 2  other sequels to this novel, "Beauty's Punishment" &  "Beauty's Release" and if you want to know what happens you have  to read all 3!  I can't wait to read the next 2 myself
