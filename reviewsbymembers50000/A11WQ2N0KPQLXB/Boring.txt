 I could not believe how boring this book was! It was nothing like I thought it would've been.  The storyline is very dull, I didn't make much sense out of it, and I thought about throwing it in the dumpster!  I am really glad I did not buy this book, luckily i borrowed it from a friend! You can't imagine how disappointed I was with this book! I thought it would be the coolest thing to find out about Thee Wicked Witch of the West!  But it was boring, and I thought most of it didn't revolve around her anyway.  The book could've been made so much better.... why wasn't it?
