 The follow up to the big selling "Heart" has a bit of weak moments in the album.  Although all of the songs are good to listen to, they just don't match up to its prodessor.  The Highlight songs on this album is: "Alone" "I Want You So Bad" "Who Will You Run To?" and "Strangers Of the Heart".  When I listen to this album, I do enjoy it, but its best not to compare it to the 1985 self titled album.
