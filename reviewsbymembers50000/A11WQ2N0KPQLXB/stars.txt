 I grew up watching this movie. This was one of my favorite cartoon movie when I was younger.  It was such a well made movie. I thought that the voice of the Unicorn (Mia Farrow) was ever so enchanting for an immortal creature. I had tried over the years to find the movie, but couldn't find it. It had been out of print for quite some time. Well thanks for time and a little bit later I finally did get to buy the movie. The next thing I wanted to do was to find the novel and read it. I had wondered if the novel had the same power as the movie had. I was so happy to find out that it did. I was so happy to find out that the guy who wrote the screenplay for the movie was also the writer of the novel... Peter S. Beagle. I have read a few of his works since then and have been impressed... He is a great author. In a biography of himself he had said, that "The Last Unicorn" was the only novel that anyone ever identifies him with. If I were him, I would feel honored to have such a beautiful story to be remembered by.
