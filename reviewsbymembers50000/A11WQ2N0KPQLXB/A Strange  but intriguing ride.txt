 I recently read this novel.  It took me about a day and a half to finish it.  I must say it was really a unique masterpiece!   If someone was to ask me to give a brief summary, there is no way that I could do it, the whole  novel is important.  It's dark in it's own way, too.  and different from  anything that I have every read... It's truly a strange, but intriguing  ride...
