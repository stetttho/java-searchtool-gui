 Im a big fan of Marilyn Monroe, and I've always liked her songs in her movies.  So I bought this particular album on tape []and it hasn't left my car since.  The Sound isn't great, so im sure if you bought a more remastered album of hers it would take care of it, I wish some songs were on it that weren't like "When Love Goes Wrong" and "Down In  The Meadow" rather than "A Boy Chases A Girl" which barely features her and is from the not so Great "There's No Business Like Show Business" other minuses are "Heat Wave" and "One Silver Dollar". I Especially like "A Little Girl From Little Rock" and "Bye Bye Baby" and of course the Unforgettable "Happy Birthday Mr. President" and "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"
