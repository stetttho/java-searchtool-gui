 Is The Chorus line to my favorite song on this cd called "By Now".  The album "Dive" is hidden with buried treasures of songs, that Ms. Brightman doesn't perform at her shows.  This is one of my favorite new age albums of all time.  The highlight songs on this album is: "By Now" "Captain Nemo" "The Second Element" "Once In A Lifetime" and "La Mer".  I think it's a brillant album, and it always puts me in a good mood with its beauty and sincerity.  I recommend this album, as well as "La Luna"... They are both great albums :)
