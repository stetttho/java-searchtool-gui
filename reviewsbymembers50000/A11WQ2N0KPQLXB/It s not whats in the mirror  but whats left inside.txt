 Alongside of "Wild Heart" and "Bella Donna" this is my favorite Stevie CD.  The album itself is mesmerizing and I was definetly intrigued with some of her thought-provoking lyrics.  The album was produced in a castle, which you can tell in some of the songs like "Rooms on Fire" and "Ooh My Love" that the castle inspired Stevie as well.  The albums theme was of "Alice" from Carrol's "Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass" which I thought was really cool too.  There were some songs that I felt that did not need to be on this album, mainly "Two Kinds Of Love" and "I Still Miss Someone" those songs were never that special.  However, the rest of the album is excellent, with fun music and captivating lyrics.  Enjoy...
