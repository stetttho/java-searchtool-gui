 And listen to this album!!  I've been eagerly anticipating this album since I heard the amazing "Breakaway" the end of this summer!!  I read somewhere from Kelly that this was a more rock-type album but with soul, and I definetly agree.  Most of the songs are similar to the rock influence of "Breakaway" and songs like "Just Missed The Train" and "Low" from her debut CD.  "Breakaway" is an inspirational song that has become a big hit for Kelly!  It's about following your dreams and following your own path.  "Since You've Been Gone" is the next new single. It's very rocking song about how she can be on her own again after her so-called lover left her.  "Behind the Hazel Eyes" "Gone" "I Hate Myself For Losing you" are all in the same vein.  They are all very rock-oriented and strong.  "Because Of You" is a little baffling to me.  I'm sure I'll understand where she's coming from the more I hear it.  It's a beautiful song... check out the lyrics to see what I mean.  "Hear Me" is also a very awesome song!  I heard, at one time this was to be the title of the album probably before the surprise hit that "Breakaway" was.  The bonus on this album is "Beautiful Disaster". It's the live version!  It's much more stripped down than the more upbeat from the debut album.    I strongly recommend buying this album.  It is a departure from "Thankful" but it truly stands on it's own.  It seems more like a heartbreak album than the previous album, but what a wonderful artist to interpret these feelings!  "Hear Me i'm crying out/i'm ready now/ turn my world upside down/find me/i'm lost inside this crowd/it's getting loud/i need you to see/i'm screaming for you to please/hear me"
