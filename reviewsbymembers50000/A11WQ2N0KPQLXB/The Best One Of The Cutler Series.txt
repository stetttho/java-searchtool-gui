 V.C. Andrews is my favorite author.  I love every book that she has every  read.  However, the Cutler series is my least favorite series.  It's for  reasons unknown, but I just don't think that it was the best series.  Out  of all of them "Twilight's Child" is my favorite.  I think it's  because of the strength and the growth of the character Dawn.  It also  seems there is more of a story in this one compared to "Dawn" and  "Secrets".
