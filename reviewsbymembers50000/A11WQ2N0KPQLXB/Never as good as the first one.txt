 I agree that there were quite a bit "wet and wild" scenes in this book, but in no way should be compared to the first one.  This novel, lacks a plot really.  It surrounds Beauty and the beloved prince Triston.  It happens over in a matter of days which is nothing at all.  If you  enjoyed, "The Claiming Of Sleeping Beauty" stick to that one....  Maybe "Beauty's Release" will be better!
