 I read this book in my Mult-Literature Class.  I must say, I found it hard to put down.  I loved how Michael Dorris got you into the minds of the characters.  He would show how one persons point of view is different from  the other ones point of view.  It was really great!  It's about 3  generations of women, who go through the good times and bad times, too...  and really come together in the end.  I loved it!
