 This was the second novel that I have read from Ms. Kinsolver.  "Animal Dreams" being the first one.  I found the novel well written at times and a little boring at others.  It's about this 6-year old  girl who discoveries that a boy had fallen down a hole near the hoover dam.   When people found out that she had told the truth, she became popular and  was feautured on the "Oprah Winfrey Show".  Doing this, an  attorney finds out and realizes that there's a chance that Turtle (the  daughter) was never legally adopted.  This story goes back to the first  book, "The  Bean Trees"  Taylor (her mother) had adopted her  after a lady coaxed her into taking her.  It was a cherokee baby girl and  now that Taylor realizes this she decides to fled the place that Turtle has  known and everyone she knows as well...
