 I found this novel very fun. It had such distasteful, unforgettable stories in it, how can one not be intrigued?!  My favorite stories were of "The Tale Of The Nymphomaniac" which is not the real title.  A story about a girl who just can't seem to... get enough! :)  I think my favorite story out of the whole series of collection would be "Grub Girl".  Its a futuristic story of a prostitute.  I can't really give away much.  Some of the stories are not erotic, and some aren't horror.  But most have an even balance.  This book is now hard to find, so I say if you should find it, buy it! You're in for a ride!!
