 I definetly recommend "Swan Song" for anyone who has not read it!  True, it may be long, but it's FAR from boring... Oh, I love it... The characters, are so VIVID, so strong, and some are so EVIL!   One of my only books that ever made me cry.... I love the vividness in it, and the way he  described things.... It's a MUST read!
