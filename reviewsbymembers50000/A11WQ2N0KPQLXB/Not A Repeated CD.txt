 Actually this CD is not a "Repeated" CD. One Disk is from her 1993 Album "Real" and the other is the 1991 release of "Live Your Life Be Free".  I'd hardly call this a complilation cd, since this CD has only 2 of her completed cds on them.  And only about 4 songs that made it onto "A Place On Earth". But it is worth having cuz either of the CDs are in print anymore.  And all of the songs are wonderful, But mark my words, Its not a Greatest Hits CD!!!!!!
