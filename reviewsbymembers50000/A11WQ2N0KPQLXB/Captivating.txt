 This novel continues right where "The Clan Of The Cave Bear" leaves off.  Ayla, the lead character in the book, has been cursed with death and is forced to leave the only people she has ever known.  Her journey takes her to the Valley of Horses, where Ayla chooses to live.  Along the way, she befriends a Horse and Cave Lion Cub. Unlike "Clan Of The Cave Bear" this book was not as intriguing as its original.  Certain parts of the novel, I felt could have been cut out, i.e. I thought the whole story of Jondalar and his brother Thonolan could've been cut out.  I know it was put there for us to be introduced to Jondalar, but their story was not that interesting.  I would have perferred that they kept them out of the story until Ayla meets them.  It would've kept the novel at a steady pace rather than cutting back to Ayla and then cutting back to Jondolar. I think it would have made Jondolar more intriguing, if he were more of a mystery. What excited me about "COTCB" was the Cave People themselves, were unlike anything like us, as to where in this book the Zolandiis and Mamutoi are more of who we are today, which I find unbelievable. But overall, I am very happy with this book, and Am very happy for Ayla in this book!  There is a certain flare to this book which is compelling.  I definetly have grown attached to Whinney and Baby!  I do recommend this book to anyone who is interested, and I will continue on with "The Mammoth Hunters"....
