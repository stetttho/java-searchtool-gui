 "They Thirst" was the second novel that I have read from Mr. McCammon.  He is truly one of the best authors I have ever read... I think he beats out Stephen King, even!  I wonder why he is so underestimated as  an author, though?  He has over a dozen books... but anyway... the novel is  about vampires taking over Los Angeles... It freaked me out because I live  near San Diego and the vampires had mentioned that being the next place  they would hit... Scary!  Oh, well... it's fiction... but that's what is so  great about his novels is that they are soooo realistic... he is the best!
