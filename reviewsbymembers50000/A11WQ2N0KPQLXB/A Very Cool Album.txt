 I've known of Tina Arena since "Chains" in 1996.  This is the first cd that I own of hers.  I bought this album, because I heard "I Want To Spend My Lifetime Loving You".  I thought it was a pretty cool track so i sampled the cd, I decided there and then, i must have it!  Some of the best songs on this album are: Burn, If I Was A River, I Want To Know What Love Is and In Command.  I was really surprised that no one mentioned "IN Command" on the reviews, that is one of my favorite songs! as well as "I Want To Know What Love Is" I like it better than the original version, definetly adds a freshness to it.  Buy the album!!
