 After reading "I.W.T.V" and "T.V.L" I was ready to read the "Queen Of The Damned"  This novel has a uniquness to it than the other two... It's kind of like reading a novel with a bunch of  short stories in it... It goes through what happened the night of Lestat's  big performance in San Francisco that wasn't mentioned in the last book...  Great I personally didn't like the Queen... I think she could've been  more evil and more clever...  My favorite part of the novel is the  "Legend Of The Twins" that was my favorite... it basically tells  about how Vampires started exsisting... it's a great novel... and of  course, our hero Lestat is a major part in the novel... Plus Claudia's  diary is found, but I'm not saying what it says... you'll have to read it  yourself!  But you'll love it, trust me...
