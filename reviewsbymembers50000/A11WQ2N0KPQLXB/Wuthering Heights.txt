 This is one of the first novels I have read that came from the 1800's... It is truly a great novel... and I even liked the 1930's film... and even liked the song... funny!   It's really a piece of art.. It kind of  reminds me of a VC Andrews about rage & revenge.. Probably the  "Flowers In The Attic" series... It's truly a great novel, and a  heartbreaking one of that... and I had some problem understanding some of  the words that I didn't understand... I had to look them up in a  dictionary...
