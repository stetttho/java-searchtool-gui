 I'm always excited when an artist releases their first greatest hits! I don't know what it is... maybe it's the songs that are chosen? Maybe it's looking back on a span of a career?  I figured that since it has been a decade (that's usually when a greatest hits is released) that it was about time Shania released hers...  This is not exactly a pretty set list for a few reasons.  I don't know why they'd open up with "Forever and For Always" It's a great song, but I would've thought she'd gone for the newest single (Party for Two) or a upbeat opening which is always a good choice.  There are only 3 songs from UP!  "I'm Gonna Get You Good", "Up" and "Forever And For Always" but what about "When You Kiss Me" or "Ka-Ching" or "It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing" there are some magnificent songs on this album that's been excluded due to the likes of mediocre songs like "Honey I'm Home" "No One Needs To Know" and "Come On Over"  I do like some of the harder to find mixes like "From This Moment On" and "I'm Gonna Get You Good" but "That Don't Impress Me Much" sticks out like a sore thumb! The original is far superior.  Then there is the omission of songs from her first album.  Granted, she didn't write any of the singles & it was a flop, but there were songs that people enjoyed that Shania still performs i.e. "What Made You Say That?" comes to mind... after all, this is a retrospective!  "Party For Two" should have only one version.  Just like Sheryl Crow's "First Cut is The Deepest" it only needs to be on the record once.  IMO I like the version with Billy rather than Mark (even though I do like Sugar Ray)  HIGHLIGHT SONGS: I'm Gonna Get You Good, From This Moment On, Man I Feel Like A Woman, Love Gets Me Everytime, You're Still The One, The Woman In Me, If You're Not In It For Love  Bottom line: I just think overall it could've been a better CD, but it seems a little thrown together!  I can't wait until we get another studio album from Ms. Twain!!
