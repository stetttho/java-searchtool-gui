 The first time I ever even heard of Vanessa Williams was for the video of "Save The Best For Last."  I couldn't believe what a beautiful song it was and what a beautiful woman that song that song!! So I went and bought "The Comfort Zone" on cassette, and loved the album!  I'm not a huge R&B fan, but I love this album. I bought it on CD eventually as well as other Vanessa albums.  I think this album is the best.  It has everything from Jazz to R&B to Pop to Rap.  It's a great compilation of music!! The COMFORT ZONE: A Great opening song... very smooth, jazzy feel to it.  It has very catchy lyrics. RUNNING BACK TO YOU: one of my all time favorite songs!! Very Dancey and sassy lyrics. "I won't play the fool... no, not this time." WORK TO DO: I always thought it was a catchy, easy listening to song. YOU GOTTA GO: The first duet with Brian McKnight.  I always thought their voices went well together! STILL IN LOVE: It's a pretty good R&B kind of song, but I feel it's a little too long. SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST: The song that made Vanessa's career! Awesome melody!  Her only #1 song. WHAT WILL I TELL MY HEART: from the "Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man"soundtrack.  The Dinah Washington cover... it's an okay song, but not one i'm particularly listen to constantly. STRANGER'S EYES: Another Great song!! I always have it playing in my head! 2OF A KIND: Another great pop song! FREEDOM DANCE (GET FREE):  It's definetly a great funky song to get down with! JUST FOR TONIGHT: A great ballad! ONE REASON: Another great ballad! I Love the lyrics in the song! BETTER OFF NOW: I Think it's a sweet song, "Better off saying goodbye." GOODBYE: It's a good song, but one of the least out of my opinions... They probably should have used Better Off Now to close the album... But all in all, it's a great album... Save the best for last and play this Disc!!
