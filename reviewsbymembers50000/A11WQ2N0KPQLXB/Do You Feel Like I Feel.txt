 Belinda Carlisle is one of my all-time favorite female singers.  And her hits still make me happy to this day. Although this is a rather "watered down" compilation.  It includes the hits "Heaven is a place on earth" "I get weak" "Circle in the sand" "Leave a light on" "Do you feel like I feel?" "Mad about you" & "Summer Rain".  If you are a casual fan, this is a good CD. But if you want to learn more about this beauty, I would recommend "A Place On Earth" or "The Essential Belinda Carlisle" both of which you can purchase on amazon.com.  The only problem with those 2 is the omission of "Mad About You" which was released on a different record company & was not a hit in the UK.
