 This is my first Anne Rice novel that I have read and thought it was magnificent. In some parts, I felt that she got into too much detail, but once you bair with it... it gets good trust me... If you love poetry this is definetly the book, I have heard the novel is distasteful... I don't think so there is nothing erotic or distasteful about this novel... It's very simple story... I really like it... I'd read it again.
