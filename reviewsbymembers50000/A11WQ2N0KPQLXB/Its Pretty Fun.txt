 Although, the album is now over 10 years old and these remixes are now a bit dated.  They are still pretty fun to hear!! I think "Into the Groove" was the best remix.  And "Spotlight" should've been a single.  The only reason I gave this album 3-stars was because Im not a big fan of Remixes, but I am a huge fan of Madonna, and she can release anything and i wouldn't give it less than 3 stars!!
