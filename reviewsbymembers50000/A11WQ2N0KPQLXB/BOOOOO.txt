 I know im going to get dissed majorly for this, but I don't care!! My friends and I decided to watch this when It first came out on HBO... I totally didn't get it?!?! why did she have to lip synch every single damn song... that got so annoying...  Iknow it's harder for her to sing since she dances, but I know alot of people who can dance and sing at the same time!  And what's this whole thing about trying to make a "Young britney and sexy britney"?? she is such a contradiction!! Not to mention the in-between-song skits... like the hippy section... what the heck was that all about?  I admit I do like some of britneys songs and it seems she does have a good personality, but this concert is not one of her best... I had to stop it before the end of the concert... cuz I was getting a britney headache.... MY TWO CENTS.. You may now attack....
