 Basically everything was explained over again in this novel.  I understand that they had to explain to the Zelandonii & the members of their cave, but Ms. Auel should know that WE KNOW what happened.  Why make us read the same events over and over again?  Why couldn't she just said "Ayla explained about how she discovered the firestones" that would have made me feel better.  I read somewhere that this book is a buildup for the next book, that makes sense with the introduction of ALL the members of this cave, to explain each status & how they feel about Ayla individually, But Still.... This book is overly repititious in every way.  How many times do we have to hear about her unusual accent? YES WE KNOW!! How many times about the firestones?  YES WE KNOW!! How many times about her animals? YES WE KNOW!! Although I found about the whole novel completely annoying, I did enjoy the Summer meeting & when Ayla does deliever her child.  That, for me was thrilling.  I've read each novel, and I'm so glad that she finally is having a child. I think this is actually a good book for people who have never read the other books.  It would make more sense.  It almost covers EVERYTHING in every book. I was lucky enough to read the previous novels about a year and a half before this one was released.  I feel sorry for the people have waited and waited for 12 years for this book they could've written theirselves. I will read the next novel when it comes out.  I PRAY that it will be less repitious.  I'm curious to know what happens to Brukevel, the man who is half-flathead (clan) who needs mass-therapy.
