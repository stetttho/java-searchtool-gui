 I loved "The Vampire Lestat" and "The Queen of the  Damned", and i thought this one would be similar, but i was wrong.  It  was a very excellent novel with only a few selected characters in it.  When  I first started reading it, it took me 4 days to get past the first 100  pages.  But when Lestat finally exchanged bodies I couldn't put it down.  I  thought that this novel was the most adventurous than the others.  I  couldn't put it down, I finished it in 2 days.
