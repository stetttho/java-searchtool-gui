 I admit it... I saw the movie before I read the book, but the movie was sooo good I had to read the book... The book is exceptional, but the movie is great!  I loved the characters, and the novel was written very well...  and it's an easy read... I read it without thinking "I have to hurry  and get to the end" it's a very mellow novel and I just took my time  reading it... I think alot of readers need to read this book, just to relax  and not be too anxious to finish it...
