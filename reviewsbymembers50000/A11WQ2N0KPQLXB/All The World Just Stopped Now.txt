 While I listened to this CD.   I'm a big fan of Tori and was a little thrown off by this collection.  So I set all negativities aside and played the CD.  I believe this CD truly tells a story from beginning to end.  I was surprised that I was entranced by each song and they sounded new to me (even though i've heard most 100 times or more). My only negative on this cd is the Re-mix of "Professional Widow" which does not fit in this album at all.  I don't know what Tori was thinking on that one. I loved the new version of "Mary" but prefer the old version of "Sweet Dreams." I feel I need to grow on "Angels" a little bit more, but fell in love with "Snow Cherries From France" my only complaint is it could've been longer!! I wasn't phased by the newer sounds that were added like most people.  I thought it was cool to update the sound a little. My original complaint was the omission of some songs. "Putting The Damage On" (which is on the DVD), "Northern Lad" (DVD), "Talula", "1000 Oceans" and "Pretty Good Year" (DVD) But listening to this cd, I don't think they would've fit in Tori's story telling. My recommendation to new fans: Start with this CD, but move on to her other albums & singles.... there's alot to learn...
