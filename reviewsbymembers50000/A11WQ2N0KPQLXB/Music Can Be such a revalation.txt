 Just like millions of other Madonna fans.  I happen to buy her 14th cd "Music" the day it came out (which was on the 19th of september).  I was shocked by the sounds of this album, I found it just like everyone else said, like a breath of fresh air.  It was so much more uplifting then her previous "Ray Of Light".  I was also shocked that there were only 10 songs on this album, which I find rare for Madonna!  I found it a blessing, because it was jammed pack with great material and not certain songs that you want to skip over.  First came "Music" which is her first number 1 single since 1994's "Take A Bow"... This is the total Madonna comeback song, and it leads her back to her earlier days of just wanting to go out and have fun.  "Impressive Instant" was the following song from "Music"  It was a very dancey song and very fun to listen to as well as "Runaway Lover".  One of my favorite tracks on this album is "I Deserve It"  It would sound good as a live acoustic song.  I can see Madonna wearing her cowboy hat and singing with just a mick and someone playing the guitar.  "Amazing" reminded me of her previous "Beautiful Stranger" which I thought was kind of tiring since the release of that song last summer.  "Nobody's Perfect" is my second favorite song from this album.  Tell me who cannot relate to this song??  "Don't Tell Me" is a very neat song, and it brings me back to her earlier 90's sound.  I don't know what it is, but maybe it's her voice in it.  "What It Feels Like For A Girl" is a cool song.  I think it will be a single.  "Paradise" reminds me of "Skin" which was on her "Ray Of Light" album.  It's very nice, i love it.  And the closing "Gone" It had some sort of twang in it, very country like.  I loved it!  Who ever thinks that Madonna is a thing of the past?? You better go and buy this cd!
