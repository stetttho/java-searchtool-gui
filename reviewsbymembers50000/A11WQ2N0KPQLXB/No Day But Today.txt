 I have never seen the play or even listened to the broadway score before I went and saw this movie.  I don't know what it is that draws me to this movie, but theres a power there that I cannot escape.  I don't know if it's the memorable characters, the songs or their lifestyle that I identify with, but Im in complete awe everytime I listen to the soundtrack or watch the movie.  I saw this movie twice in the theater and I can't wait for the DVD to come out to watch the documentary of Jonathan Larson.  I also own the broadway album which I love since I've seen the film. My goal is to see the broadway show when they come down to my neck of the woods!
