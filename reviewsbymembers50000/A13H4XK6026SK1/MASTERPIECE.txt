 Carl Seagan's decision in making this series was taken after the disappointment caused on general public as the first pictures from Viking Lander showed nothing else than rocks on Mars. However, he believed that interest in science could be excited through the most powerful communication medium, television.  And he got it. Cosmos was watched for over 500 million people in 60 different countries. In U.S.A. it became the most widely watched series in the history of American public television winning the Emmy and Peabody Award. In Brazil the success was so great that it was cast three times through the main TV network. Cosmos deals with a wide range of matters such as ancient civilisations, biological evolution, history of philosophy, brain's working, origin and fate of universe and much more.... This magisterial masterpiece is not only a travel from the microscopic DNA chain to the vastness of sideral space but also a self questioning about human beings. If you ever wondered about who are we, where are we from or where are we going to,  you will find some answers in this fascinating series. Cosmos is an exciting voyage through the world of knowledge.  One could suppose that after almost twenty years the visual effects as well as the series itself would be out-of-date. That is not true. The power of Cosmos lays mainly on Carl Seagan's ingeniousness to instigate our imagination and foment the perception of our universe. All of that is underlined by beautiful excerpts of erudite music and exquisite Vangelis' music which fit so perfectly into the series that it seems to have been composed specifically to it. It will surely remain as the most magnificent program ever produced for TV for many years to come. It deserves a sixth star.
