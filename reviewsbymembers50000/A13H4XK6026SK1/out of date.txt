 One should expect that an important achievement such as the journey of voyager I and II through the planets would bring unvaluable data and reveal exciting images from other planets. However it was rather disapointingly to watch a great scientific event through pale images in the age of digital video and poor data information in the turning of the century. If you wish to have an up-to-date news about our solar system and see astonishing images I would recomend "The Planets" produced by BBC.
