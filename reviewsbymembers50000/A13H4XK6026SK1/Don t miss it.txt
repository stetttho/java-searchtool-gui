 This is one of the best video I have ever purchased on Laser Disc and now I am replacing it with the DVD version. Everything works very well: the right movement of the camera, the melodious music, the correct conduction of the orchestra, the beautiful scenarios, the rich production and the brilliant performance of the dancers. This is a must for any ballet-lover. I have been waiting for this DVD release for a long time.
