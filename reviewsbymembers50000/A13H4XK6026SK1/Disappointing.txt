 When I purchased this DVD I was expecting to watch a documentary the level of BBC or National Geographic. Unfortunately the scientific informations provided by this video scarcely fill one disc and the remaining topics in other 3 discs are only about curiosities, popular beliefs, ancient legends and bugs being used as medicine and food. Differently from David Attenborough's serious documentaries where his interference is minimun and necessary, the presence of Georges Brossard (a mixture of actor, clown and ontologist) is annoying. He wishes to be the star of the show more than the insects. Unbelievably, even the scientfic informations provided by him are limited and not new: The only insects' way-of-life he focus in detail are ants and termites but all of these informations can be found in documentaries not specialized in insects such as BBC's The Life of Plants and Trials of Life. The two stars go to some beautiful closes on insects and that's all.
