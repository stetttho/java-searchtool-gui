 This video is about the organisms in the animal kingdom grouped according to their common ancestry and assemblage of traits defined as: " phylum". 98% percent of all animals fall into eight main ones and each episode features one of these eight phyla. Scientific evidences and discussion with researchers are used together with detailed 3-D computer generated drawings and captivating images of exquisite undersea creatures to explain the structure, origin and evolution of them. In addition to the highly valuable scientific information there are also beautifull and astonishing closes of creatures such as sponges, jellyfish, crustaceans, nautilus and sea stars. This is the highest level documentary and the best quality image I have ever seen.
