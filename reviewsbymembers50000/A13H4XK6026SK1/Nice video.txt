 This video shows highlights from some beautiful ballets performed by the renamed Kirov Ballet at Convent Garden under the presence of Lady Diana and in Red Square under the presence of Russian people. Although most of  the numbers chosen are famous I would not say they are essential as the title of this DVD suggest. There are far more important and interesting works which is not included in it. However I would recommend this DVD for those who are just curious about the art of ballet or want to be acquainted with it. The production is careful and the image and the sound are goods. This video is a nice entertainment for the whole family.
