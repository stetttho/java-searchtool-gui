 This is one of the best DVDs from "Hebert von Karajan Legacy for Home Video" series. Apart from the beautifull music there are several (good) surprises as the orquestra plays the famous Strauss's partitures. This is probably the only video that shows Karajan laughing, smiling and interacting with the audience. The musicians and the public also seem to be very pleased with this party .
