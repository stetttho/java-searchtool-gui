 An interesting video about our solar system. Differently from other videos which deal about this same subject "The planets" is not a mere old movie full irrelevant informations. It really discusses and speculates about the new theories of formation and composition of different worlds. The computer generated animations are impressive and the sound quality very good. The only single failure is that it sometimes waste time with "personal experiences". That's a good acquisition to your DVD's scientific collection.
