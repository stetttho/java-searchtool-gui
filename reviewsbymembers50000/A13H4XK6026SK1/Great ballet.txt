 Although I havent purchased the vhs version of Spartacus it seems that some technical problems such as the jump between the scenes and some white points in the film pointed out by some previous reviewers have been diminished in the dvd version (shown in widescreen): I was distracted  by those imperfections only three or four times. However what most annoyed me was the "special effects" such as the splitting scenes and superimposing images. The sound quality is poor: there is a constant "hiss" that is hard to be filtered by the receiver. The lightning in the stage is rather dark. However all of that is a minor detail if one consider the work as whole: This is a great ballet that alternates vigorous and sensual dances, supported by powerful and exquisite music rightly conducted, great production and first rate performances by the dancers. Surely a must-buy ballet.
