 This classical ballet is shown in a rather uncommon way. It seems that the director tried to merge the art of film and the art of dance to produce his own Giselle. The result of this experience is some for and against points. In my opinion the for points are the camera unusual closes, the interesting shots and the importance given on acting as well as on dancing. Considering the year of production the quality of image and sound are surprisingly goods. The against points are the excecive and sometimes disturbing cuts. I wouldn't say this is the definitive Giselle.
