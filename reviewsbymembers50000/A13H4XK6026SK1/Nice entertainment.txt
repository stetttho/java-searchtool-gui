 I have enjoyed very much the show. However, there is the risk of you to get disappointed if you intend to hear one of the three singers to reach the level of an opera performance or even the orginal "The Three Tenors". The musical repertoire is not also perfect. On the other hand I thought the arrangements, the children's choir and the sound quality very nice. I am very pleased to have purchased this DVD.
