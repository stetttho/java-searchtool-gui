 It is true that this book should perhaps not have been entitled, "Notes on Craft for Young Writers."  There is meat enough here to engage the full intellectual appetite of a professor of literary criticism.   On the other hand, there's also a lot for the young and inexperienced by  way of direction.  If the instruction is sometimes abstract, it always  points a direction by example and suggested reading.  I don't think Gardner  is a literary "snob".  He is straightforward at the beginning  about his target audience.  It doesn't include pornographers, but he gives  several examples of his precepts from many other genres, including science  fiction.  I suppose there are books out there for pornographers if they  need them.  Gardner is trying to nurture the next Dostoyevski.
