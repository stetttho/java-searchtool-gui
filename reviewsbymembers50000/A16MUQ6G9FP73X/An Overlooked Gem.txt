 I have to admit, it was reading one of the reviews which indicted this book for being 'not' politically correct which prompted my buying and reading it.  So starved am I for original thought which goes outside these  silly psycho-intellectual structures, that I've actually begun shopping for  books in this way!  However, once into it, I have to admit I felt a little  foolish at having chosen such a work of art for any reason less than  profound familiarity with it and its author.  It deserves, truly, that kind  of respect.  It is NOT about football and Frank Gifford.  It is about the  struggle to come to terms with an artistic nature, and the attempt to  define oneself against the sky of a culture which (much like p.c. does  today) demands conformity.   I realize the following is almost cliche', but  Exley really has an amazing grasp of the English language.  His  intelligence is as irrepressible as his attempts to repress it.  The book  is also a great time capsule for the Johnson era, and its flashbacks turn  in upon themselves with Nabokovian sophistication.  Very good stuff.
