 There is little to say about this book (my second reading), which hasn't been said, except that its author's tracing of a philosophical development runs the gamut from Kant to Augustine (in the book's chronology, that is).   It concerns human beings, and is based upon the Promethian premise, but at  a meaningful reduction: Prometheus suffers because the gods have rejected  him; Grendel suffers because humans have rejected him. The premise  necessarily suggests hope for the human race, whilst the monster's nihilism  protests too much.  I especially loved the description of Beowulf, and that  hero's visual hypnotic effect upon the monster.  And the fight scene  wherein Beowulf demands that the monster sing of walls.  Chaos being bent  to order.  This is great stuff.  In its own way, this is a better book than  many of the other greats published in this century: it can be read at so  many levels. I first read it in junior high school, and loved the story of  the monster and his mother and the enigmatic hero Beowulf with shoulders  rippling with horse-like muscles.
