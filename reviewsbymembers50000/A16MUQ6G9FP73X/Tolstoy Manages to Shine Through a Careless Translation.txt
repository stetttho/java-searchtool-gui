 Tolstoy, a writer of such undeniable power, proves perhaps by the most extreme scenario that he is not overrated as a transcendant writer: namely, this book is still vital despite a horribly mangled translation by Gordon Spence.  Here's one example of the needless contortions Spence plays with Russian/English: "But what he understood now by him to whom he appealed was something he knew to be the most real of everything he knew."  Another gem: ". . .and in the same week he drank not only all the money that he had received for the execution, but also all his relatively expensive clothes. . ."  Whaat?  How does one drink expensive clothes?  Yet another: "With the devoted old nurse. . .she sat in her father's closed sleigh, which had been newly repaired for the long journey, and set out on the long journey."  Come on.  How about ". . .newly repaired for the long journey, and set out."?  Yet to read the story "Divine and Human" is a seminal experience nonetheless.  Amazing, Tolstoy has to be a titan to shine through this, yet he does.
