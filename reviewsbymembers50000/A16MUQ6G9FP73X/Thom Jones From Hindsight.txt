 I write this review with perhaps a unique perspective: that of having read all three of Jones' published short story collections first.  I gave "Cold Snap" and "Sonny Liston" three and five stars,  respectively.  I have not read three books by one author consecutively  since -- and I know it's becoming a cliche', now -- E. Hemingway, F.  Fitzgerald and F. Dostoyevski.  Even James Joyce required a break after two  consecutives.  Granted, Thom Jones is lighter fare than the red meat of the  great European writers; still, I think this is high praise.  Especially  when one considers that Jones is swimming against a literary current.  He  is emphatically politically incorrect, and doesn't try (at least  objectively) to please any fashionable political school of criticism.  He  writes intelligently, universally and boldly.  I've read several criticisms  centering on an  imputed lack of thematic material.  Yet, many of the  stories in the books have absolutely nothing in common, and are written  (save for the inescapable vulgarity of speech) in totally disparate voices.   Recently, I read an article suggesting that Huxley, not Orwell, was right  about the death of literature in future generations (i.e., people lacking  the motivation to consume intelligent art, as opposed to censorship).  One  has to agree with this as the trend: with one ready exception: Mr. Jones.   He has the capacity of making us care about literature again.
