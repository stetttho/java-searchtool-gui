 I came to "Hooking Up" after having finished Paul Johnson's "Intellectuals," another great study of thought and its effect in our society.  I've actually met Tom Wolfe at Duke Univ., and was struck by how open and sensible he was.  This collection of essays is more than a humorous and hip read: it's responsible.  The research and journalism are sound; the depth of humanity displayed in the exposition of it is touching.  The defense of Naturalism in "My Three Stooges" is something that one would have thought went without saying, but for the past four decades, hasn't.  It is so good to see the inward-looking, self-absorbed writers like Updike falling at last by the wayside.  Updike's problem is that he never went out into the crazy carnival of American life and lived, took chances, felt emotion in extremis, or at least spent time with people who live in these states.  With Updike and Irving (Norman Mailer was always more of a self-promotion specialist than a good writer), writing is an intellectual parlor game: good for themselves, but not so exciting for the rest of us.  It's nice to see Wolfe having the final word here.  He's a breath of fresh air.  His writing, like his lifetime pursuits, are concerned with us, all of us.  He is truly the closest we've had in two generations to a writer who can at least claim pretentions of carrying the mantel of Dickens.
