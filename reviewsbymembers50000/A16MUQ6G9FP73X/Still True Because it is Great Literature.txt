 Having recently been exposed to European aristocracy, I found reading this book, as an American, irresistible.  I disagree with reviewers who say there is no longer tension between French and American ideology as manifest on a daily interactive level.  It's still there.  Many Americans view the French as rude and cynical (not unlike the reviewer from Jamaica, New York), whilst the French, perhaps rightly, view Americans as hopelessly naive and 'gauche'.       As James's book attests, this isn't a recent phenomenon, and the exploration of the roots of it is fascinating.  I do agree that much of the conflict stems from class distinction, but James' own interpretative notes indicate an interest in exploring the clash of ideologies, and he chose the aristocracy because it was that facet of European civilization most "entrenched" in the old ways of thinking vis a vis' the new, American viewpoint.        The narrative style is smooth.  I thought the prose more attractive than that in 'Portrait of a Lady', for instance, which was almost Teutonic in its abhorrence of placing verbs at the beginning stages of the sentences.
