 It's unforgiveable that Penguin gives away the climax of "Kreutzer Sonata" on the back cover of the book.  Also, who wants to read an inept critique, such as the one on the back cover, in advance of reading the story.  The stories themselves are not Tolstoy at his best.  Much better spending one's time reading "Anna Karenina" or "War and Peace" in the Maude translations.  These late period stories are like bad Dostoyevski, the author well past his prime.
