 Very Michael Crichton-- but the characters are a bit thin and setting them up seems a little strained (gee, I WONDER if he'll get together with the perky Asian counter-culture computer nerd?)... but the overall story is clever, the twists are nice and it's SO a big-budget movie waiting to happen. I'm a fan of theme parks and am impressed at his homework about the operations of them, it's great... overall a fun read.
