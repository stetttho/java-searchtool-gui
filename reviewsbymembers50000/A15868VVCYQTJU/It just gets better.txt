 Who'da thunk that they could only get better? No Doubt spectacularly avoided the sophomore slump with this killer followup to "Tragic Kingdom." It's different-- and better-- as Spin (or Rolling Stone?)  said, "if you liked Tragic Kingdom, you'll really like this CD, and if  you didn't like Tragic Kingdom, you'll really like this CD."  My fave  song this week: "Six Feet Under," the super New Wave-y '80s  throwback of which I just can't get enough. If you liked "New" on  the _Go_ soundtrack, wait 'til you hear it AFTER the extraordinarily  haunting "Marry Me." You can't go wrong with this  soon-to-be-monster followup from my favorite Orange County ska/punk/new  wave/'80s denizens, No Doubt.
