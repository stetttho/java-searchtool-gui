 There's no surprises here, really-- I think most of the plot points were telegraphed so clearly, even if you couldn't guess them-- but it's well done. Dense. Not a speedy read, but satisfying. If you're a struggling novelist it'll probably really speak to you; for the rest of us, a nice suspense/semi-thriller for the literate set.
