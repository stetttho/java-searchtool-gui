 it's pretty amateur writing-- a better edit would have helped a lot, and some stronger direction for the author. (in the list of links in the back of the book, the description for one is "This person rocks my world." --um, you couldn't give us anything more than that? like, why?) the stuff about the author's childhood is mildly intersting; it's a lot better when he finally visits the chocolate factories. the descriptions of the owners of the factories is great and the interviews are fun too... that's where the book really picks up.
