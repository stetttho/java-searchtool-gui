 I don't like to watch regular TV, which is why TiVO is perfect for me. I can't stand normal programming (sitcoms, dramas etc)-- my favorite things are movies and weird shows that are on at weird hours. (Iron Chef, Walt  Disney Presents, TBN Behind the Scenes, Strip Poker on USA, etc.) TiVO  now captures everything I want to see and I can watch it any time I  want. This is the most well-designed piece of consumer electronics I've  seen in ages. You will be amazed at how cool it is.
