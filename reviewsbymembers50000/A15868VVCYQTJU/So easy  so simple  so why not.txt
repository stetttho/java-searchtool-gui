 I hate to cook, I hate to clean up, it's all just awful... but since I'm not rich enough to eat out every meal, I've been learning to make stuff at home... this steamer, combined with my Geo Foreman Grill, makes up the front line in my arsenal of indispensable kitchen appliances. I'm not sure about the guy who reviewed the unit and said the fish fell through the "mesh"-- as you can clearly see from the picture, there is no metal; the food goes in the clear plastic chamber and there are tiny holes in the bottom for the steam to rise. The steamer comes with a simple cookbook-- really, more like guidelines for how much time for fresh and frozen vegetables, meats and other foods. It's just easy, and simple, and painless to set up and dump food in and when the bell rings, it's done and delicious. Nothin' to it!
