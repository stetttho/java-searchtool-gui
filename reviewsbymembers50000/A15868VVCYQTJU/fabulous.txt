 No more "$30 blenders" for me.... this thing is built like a tank, but in a good way. ...it's heavy, durable and wow does it blend. As a bonus, it's QUIETER than my old blender; who knew? The base stays screwed on the bottom, the "o" ring is thick and solid and NOTHING leaks, and the controls are easy and nice. Overall a dream blender, one that I will probably be using 30 years from now.
