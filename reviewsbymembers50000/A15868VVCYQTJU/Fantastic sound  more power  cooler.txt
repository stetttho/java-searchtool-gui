 Just a few quick notes-- don't underestimate the value on a single cord coming off one year-- it's really convenient and feels less "fussy" in the gym when I'm on the elliptical trainer. The sound quality on these is better than my old Sony headphones and, notably, these require less power-- I have to keep my mp3 player turned way down to "3" to listen to music comfortably; my old headphones required the volume up to "12". (And the volume goes up to 30, so I suspect most headphones are designed for the 12-20 range... meaning these Aiwa headphoens are very efficient at converting the signal to sound.) Anyhow, I love 'em, glad I got them.
