 Unfortunately, I'd have to agree with everyone else-- I was not impressed with this unit at all. It has a poor interface and picked up tons of interference from my microwave and 802.11b (Wi-Fi) network router. (I point this out becauase the phone I replaced it with [more on that in a minute] had no problems with interference.) The worst problem was the face that it would "own" a phone line when it connected: if I was on Line1 on the main base, nobody on any extension could join me on Line1. So it was impossible to do conference calls with others in the house. Also, the extension handsets are shoddy and poorly-manufactured; the buttons were hard to press and non-responsive. I replaced the entire unit with a Panasonic KX-TG2740, which has a very similar featureset but actually works well. :-) More about the TG2740 on my review over there...
