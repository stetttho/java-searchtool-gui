 I love it; it looks sharp and keeps things organized SO well, but... 1. why do I have to remove a screw with a screwdriver to open it? 2. why, oh why, can't the FRONT lip have an adjuster as well? my Toshiba Satellite laptop doesn't open to the full 180 degrees (and it's not listed on their web site, so be aware)... so I had to stick a big rubber wrist-rest under the front of the Oyster to get it to lean back a little and see the screen. It would be sooooo easy for Oyster to put some adjustible legs on the front corners, or something, to let it lean back further... and it's just a crime that they didn't. I can't believe something so elegantly and beautifully designed requires me to jam a piece of rubber under the front lip to make it usable. sheesh :-)
