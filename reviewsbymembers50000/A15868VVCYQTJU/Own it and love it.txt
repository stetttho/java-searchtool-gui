 I live in L.A. and this has replaced my car for most errands around the neighborhood (yeah, that's me you saw shooting down Beverly Blvd.) I use it every day to go to the gym, the dry cleaner, the burrito place, my post-office box, the library, etc. I love that I'm not adding to the traffic and smog problem with a car, that I'm burning clean with electricity, and that I'm not getting rumpled and sweaty like I do on a bicycle. It may seem expensive but after doing the math, I realized it'll pay for itself in about a year... pretty freakin' great. If just 1/4 of the people in L.A. used these instead of their cars, we'd be able to see the Hollywood sign instead of a hazy smog layer...
