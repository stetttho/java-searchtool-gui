 If you are an intermediate-or-better PHP programmer who wants to get a handle on regular expressions, you'll find this book so incredibly handy. I'm only a few chapters into the book and already I get the gist of regexs and how to use them with PHP... plus the Perl examples are very, very clear (the author stays focused on regex, Perl is just used to put it in a program's context, so he explains clearly what is going on with each line and you can see how it would translate easily to PHP)... the first chapter of this book did more to explain regexs than spending weeks searching the web for a *clear* tutorial. I suspect I'll skip most of the second half of the book-- after all, it's called "mastering regular expressions," and I don't really want to master them, I just want to be really good and then keep going with other stuff. (The author spends chapters looking at nearly EVERY regex tool out there, etc... which is not useful to me since I know I'm going to be using regexs 99% of the time in PHP.) If there is anything I could change about this book, it would be to put the first five-or-so chapters into a separate slim volume and *PLEASE* include a quick reference card for all the metachars! (that's my next purchase...) But listen, if you want to LEARN regexs, this book does the job, the writing is crystal-clear, the mini-quizzes every few pages are excellent, the typographic conventions (used to really make the expressions clear) are clever and smart, and this book has EVERYTHING you will EVER need on regular expressions, in your entire life. <g> Well worth the $; you won't ever need another regex book again.
