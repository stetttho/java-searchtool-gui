 The ear clips are no problem at all-- I wouldn't even call them "clips" as much as "hangers," they just hold the earpieces very lightly against the ears. The sound quality is AMAZING. If you're still using those white iPod headphones, do yourself a favor and upgrade to these... you'll hear all kinds of new things in the music that you never knew was there...
