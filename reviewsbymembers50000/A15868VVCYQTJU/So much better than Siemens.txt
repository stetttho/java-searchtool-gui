 I had a Siemens phone system that I dumped and replaced it with this one. I recommend reading the other reviews; here's some notes to fill in the gaps: 1. I haven't had any problems with battery life. It seems "normal" --i.e. I probably get several hours talk time and many hours standby, but I keep the phone in the charger at night and most of the day when I'm not using it, so it's not like it's ever far from being charged 100%. 2. The phone is solid and well-designed (unlike the Siemens). The base unit does not have a headset jack, but the handset does (as do the add-on handsets, a separate product). 3. The add-on handsets, BTW, are almost exactly the same as the handset that comes with the base station: slightly (very slightly) different form factor, but the same buttons and interface. 4. The directory on the hanset is a bit clunky to use, I agree, but it works. 5. The caller ID seems to work great for me. No problems. 6. The interface is very clear and easy to use, unlike the Siemens. 7. I can't comment on the answering machine as I don't use it. 8. In addition to the speakerphone in the base unit, the handset has a speakerphone! Yes, the HANDSET-- it's like a portable speakerphone. Kind of an odd feature but I find myself using it occasionally. Neat. 9. Anyone on an extension phone can join into a conversation (unlike the Siemens). So if I am on Line1 and want someone in the kitchen to join in the call, they can just pick up that phone and press Line1 and be there with me. Hope this helps. best Eric
