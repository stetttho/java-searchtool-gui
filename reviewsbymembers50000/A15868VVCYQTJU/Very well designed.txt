 Hey, the picture is not clear at all-- this is a phone with an alarm clock on its "back" --when the phone is laying down in the charger, it looks like an alarm clock, with a design on the side. (The Amazon photo above shows only the "face" of the phone; you can't see the clock display at all.) Search on the web for "tg272s" and tyou can find other, clearer photos. That said... this is a VERY well designed handset. The alarm has a backlight but it's not incredibly bright, which is great since it sits right next to me on the bedside table (my last alarm clock was like stadium lighting at night!)... the feature set is almost identical to the base handset, including the integrated speakerphone (!), the dual line support, etc. There is no headset jack, that's not cool, but the alarm is clear, has a snooze feature and is easy to set, too. The phone book can be transferred from the base unit, just like the other expansion handsets. Overall, smart design, and a perfect mix (for me, anyhow) of the alarm clock and phone functionality that I needed in my bedroom.
