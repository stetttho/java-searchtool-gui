 The continuing adventures of Rex Mundi, Elvis and Barry the Time Sprout amongst others, which surpasses even the original which was hysterical. This is the funniest book of its type since The Hitchhiker's Guide to the  Galaxy. The best parts of the book are the introductions to each chapter  which seem to be totally unrelated to the story but gain more relevance as  the book goes on; the best one with the two wildly differing accounts of  Hugo Rune turning himself invisible.  A must read if you like that sort of  thing.
