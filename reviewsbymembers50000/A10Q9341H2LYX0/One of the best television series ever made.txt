 ..."Welcome to The Hellmouth" and "TheHarvest" (Season 1 ep 1 & 2) is the beginning of the show andpicks off where the movie left off, with an unanswered question or two (what happened to Pike?) and a little tweaking....  It introduces the characters and it is really quite amazing how quickly they have taken to the roles they have. The jump from the unscreened pilot for Fox to this is nothing short of phenomenal. There is some great action as Buffy and the rest have to foil the attempts of The Master as he attempts to rise to surface from the underground, .... (S1 ep 3) "Witch" is a good episode where Buffy finds that someone will do anything to get on the cheerleading squad.... (S1 ep 5) "Never Kill A Boy on the First Date" shows the difficulties of trying to juggle a social life with the night-time job of fighting demonic forces - and showing that it's going to be a work in progress. (S1 ep 7) "Angel" is a very good episode which finally reveals the biggest secret behind one of the characters who has been mysteriously appearing in the previous episodes and gives some important background information. (S1 ep 9) "The Puppet Show" is about some particularly nasty murders at Sunnydale High and twists keep coming left right and centre. Really very good as to who actually is responsible. ....
