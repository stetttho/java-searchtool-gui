 The most useful advice I can give you about this film is this: Do not read any more of this review or any other review before you see it. In fact, don't even read the box. See it knowing as little as possible, I saw this film totally cold and really enjoyed it and was totally surprised. I think it's easily the best film I've seen in the last ten years.  ....  The casting and acting is exceptional. The highlight of the film is the line-up scene which is really funny (the director filmed the scene a number of times and chose the best take) but the film as a whole is of a very high standard and will keep you guessing until the end.   ....  Kevin Spacey is brilliant and did win an Academy Award for his role but everyone else is just as exceptional. Particular attention should be paid to Stephen Baldwin who finally found a role and a movie that can really demonstrate that his talent. As the hyperactive McManus who knows no fear and has some of the best dialogue in the film to boot.   There isn't a weak link in the film and the 5 actors who are "the usual suspects" convey exceptionally a group who find themselves trapped into a job that is seemingly unachievable but come agonisingly close to carrying out the impossible. As McManus says as they survey the mission that seems like certain doom "There's nothing that can't be done.". Through sheer bravado, they very nearly pull it off. Will you like this film? Well, with any one person it will be impossible to predict but the way ratings systems like this always work, as most people have given this film 4 or 5 stars, it means odds are you probably will. A great film which won the writer, Christopher McQuarrie an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and a must see.
