 A passable time filler, which joins the dots nicely. Within half an hour, we've had the supposed murder, trial, incarceration and release into the community on parole. No point wasting any more time on all that say I. A quick summary of the plot: Ashley Judd is framed for the murder of her husband, who disappears from their boat and leaving a lot of blood. .... The problem with this film is that it seems to be running on some very fuzzy logic. The whole "Double Jeopardy" principle that everyone quotes.... I'm no lawyer but even to me that sounds highly unlikely.  .... But then, this is one of those films that you go to see that you don't think too hard and it moves painlessly enough. Every part of the film is done as quickly and functionally as possible. Tommy Lee Jones delivers no less than you'd expect playing himself and Ashley Judd is always a pleasure to watch.
