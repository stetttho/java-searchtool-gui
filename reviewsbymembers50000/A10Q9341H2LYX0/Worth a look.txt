 This book is quite good. Dealing with a war against an alien race, mankind is forced to desperate measures in order to win a war against them. Using children that show the necessary potential to fight the war, they are  trained at a very early age in simulated combat, the hope being that one of  them has what it takes to lead Earth's space fleets against the enemy.   It is an interesting book, especially the description of the games in  the Battleroom that the children have to fight as part of their training (a  form of futuristic laser tag) as a prelude to remotely controlling  spaceships.  Deception is rife, as not surprisingly at every level, people  are not totally honest about what is really going on. The ultimate irony  may be, as what seems to be a fight for survival may have more to do with a  lack of understanding on both sides that comes far too late and that the  war may not have been needed in the first place. Much like real  life. Well worth a look, though in my opinion, the parts dealing with the  training are the best parts of the book.
