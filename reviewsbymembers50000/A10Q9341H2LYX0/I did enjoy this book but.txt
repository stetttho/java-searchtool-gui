 ... even my limited knowledge of war tells me that this book isn't slightly grounded in reality. There's no way China could possibly conquer so much of Asia and right to the US mainland all the way to Washington. Such a thing as supply lines come into play, stretching them as far as the US mainland in ridiculous. plus the fact that a technological superiority acts as a force multiplier over numbers. A naval invasion would have been chewed to pieces. The US still has that the great technical advantage this book. Also, anyone invading an island or over sea needs a 3 to 1 troop advantage to have any success. I find it especially funny that somehow the Chinese manage to launch a surprise amphibious assault on Florida AND California simultaneously. In a nutshell, even an army as sophisticated as the US could not defeat the combined armies of the US, Europe, India, Pakistan, Israel etc etc etc. Which China is not, even in the vastly improved size of their army, the US still has a technical superiority. Anyway, the story is about the President's daughter who is a grunt in the US who somehow keeps avoiding getting killed as the Chinese overrun more of the US right up to the capital, the President who has to find the means to repel the invasion and various Chinese leaders on the other side. I won't even begin to try to explain how one of the up and coming Chinese army leaders is a cousin of the President's daughter. Good for pulp entertainment but not to be taken even slightly seriously. Doesn't end satisfyingly either, you'll see what I mean if you get there. Also, I found it very odd that in this book, Taiwan and Russia were not mentioned even once.
