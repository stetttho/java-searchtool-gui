 WHAT MAKES ELO THE GREATEST ROCK N ROLL BAND ON THE PLANET ?? HARMONY ? MELODY ? ARRANGEMENT ?? ALL OF THE ABOVE ?? NO ...ACTUALLY ITS NONE OF THESE ! ITS JUST THE FACT THAT ELO IS "NOT" AMONG THE SO CALLED GREATEST IN THE EYES OF THE PUBLIC AND CRITICS WHICH GRABBED MY EYE ...AND I SHALL NOW DECLARE THEM THE UNDERDOG GREATEST......ELO COMBINES THE BEE GEES AND THE BEATLES, MIXES IT WITH A LITTLE ROY ORBISON AND KANSAS...THROW IT ALL TOGETHER AND OUT PUKES ONE GAWDY HIT AFTER THE NEXT LAYERED WITH COMPLICATED PLAYING, MIXING AND PRODUCTION UP THE A$$.....ELO PUTS ALOT OF EFFORT INTO ELO...NOTHING COMES EASY TO THEM AND THEY ARE NOT EFFORTLESS BRILLIANCE LIKE SOME LUCKY TALENT OUT THERE CAN BE...THE SONGS ARE SO CATCHY, THEY PUT SERIOUS FEAR OF GOD INTO THE WHO, THE BEATLES, THE BEE GEES, AND OTHER HARMONY TALENT...JEFF LYNN IS SUCH A HUMBLE GRACEFUL SOUL WHO WOULD NEVER TALK SH***T ABOUT ANYBODY...THIS GUY IS A SAINT BUT TRY FOR A MOMENT NOW TO IMAGINE A PISSED OFF PUNK ELO !!! WOW !! IT WOULD BE LIKE QUEEN MEETS BOWIE MEETS THE WHO MEETS ..I DONNO ..THE TUBES ?????? THESE GUYS ARE UNREAL...BUY EVERY ALBUM THEY GOT THAT YOU CAN FIND BECAUSE ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA IS THE GREATEST ROCK BAND OF ALL TIME ....AND THEY ARE NOT UNDERDOGS...THEY ARE THE STANDERED TO MEASURE ANYTHING AGAINST ...IF YOU CAN ...AND YOU CANNOT !!!!!!!!!--CLARK HAGINS AUGUST 10 , 2005
