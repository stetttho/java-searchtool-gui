 KIETH MOON'S DOUBLE BASS DRUMMING ON THIS ALBUM IS SO REVOLUTIONARY AND COMPLICATED...HE MAKES NO MISTAKES AS HE EFFORTLESSLY BREEZES FROM SONG TO SONG...THE PRECURSOR TO NEIL PEART AND RUSH ! JOHN ENTWISTLE'S BASS CANNOT BE COMPARED TO BY ANYTHING...AND PETE TOWNSHEND IS AMAZING EVEN WHEN HE IS SLOPPY...THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS SIMPLY SHOCKING THE FIRST TIME YOU HEAR IT...I'VE HEARD ALOT OF WHO BOOTLEGS THAT WERE SLOVEN BUT THIS THING IS RAZOR TIGHT AND PRECISE FROM START TO FINISH ! ...AND TO THINK THIS WAS JUST ANOTHER TYPICAL NIGHT FOR THE WHO...IT SOUNDS NOTHING LIKE THE RECORDED STUDIO WHO OF TOMMY OR WHO'S NEXT...THE HARMONY VOCALS ARE INTACT EVEN WHILE THE WHO ARE BUSY MOVING THEIR FINGERS ON DIFFICULT ARRANGEMENTS LIKE HAPPY JACK AND A QUICK ONE....THIS ALBUM BLOWS EVERYTHING AWAY...MAKES LED ZEPPELIN LOOK VERY SILLY...BUT THEN AGAIN , THE WHO MADE EVERY BAND LOOK SILLY ...ATLEAST WHEN KIETH WASN'T DRUNK AND THEY WERE HAVING AN 'ON" NIGHT....NO BAND CAN TOUCH THIS...NOT THE STONES..NOT THE DOORS, NOBODY ! BABY !
