 I THOUGHT THIS ALBUM WAS AHEAD OF ITS TIME--IN 1982 , WHEN I BOUGHT IT AT A MUSIC PLUS..REMEMBER THAT ?? THESE DAYS, ITS GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO FIND A REAL MUSIC STORE...WITH ALL THE WHEREHOUSES CLOSING AND WHATNOT...ITS GETTING SCARY...THANK GOD FOR AMAZON ! OR WOOPS...DAMN THAT AMAZON !ANYWAY...THIS ALBUM IS "90'S ALTERNATIVE ROCK" IN THE 60'S --AND IT 'KNEW" IT...THESE GUYS HAD VISION THAT WAS SO ABSURD AND IMPOSSIBLE THAT FEW TOOK THE STOOGES SERIOUSLY BACK IN THEIR DAY --THEY WERE MORE THAN GENIOUSES...THEY WERE PROFITS...THE ASHTON GUITARS SO FIERCE AND GRUNGY...THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THESE SONGS...SO PUNK AND ALTERNATIVE ! THE TRUTH BE KNOWN ...THESE GUYS KILLED ROCK N ROLL ..BECAUSE TO ME, ALOT OF LAME BANDS WITH NO TALENT COPIED THE STOOGES AND IT HAS BROUGHT US ALL DOWN NOW ...TO A VERY LOW COMMON DENOMINATOR...STILL, THANK GOD FOR THE STOOGES..I NEEDED THIS RECORD WHEN I WAS 17, I NEEDED PUNK ROCK !..IGGY IS JUST SUCH A MINDLESS FIERCE TEEN ETERNAL MORON WITH A MICROPHONE...THIS GUY WOULD GET RIGHT UP AND RAM HIS HEAD INTO A WALL...HE WAS JUST PURE ROCK N ROLL CHAOS ALONG THE FABULOUS LINES OF JIM MORRSION BUT I AM SURE EVEN MR. MOJORISEN WOULD BE SCARED OF THIS SCARY ENTITY STANDING IN A ROOM NEAR HIM ; FIVE STARS ! A CLASSIC !--CLARK HAGINS 8-8-2005
