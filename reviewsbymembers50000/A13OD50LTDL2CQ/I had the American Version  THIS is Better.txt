 USUALLY WHEN YOU SEE LOTS OF LIL' GIRLS GAZING AT THE BAND AND SINGING ALONG WORD FOR WORD WITH EVERY SONG YOU CAN LAY GUARANTEE THAT THE MUSIC SUCKS ...ESPECIALLY IF THE MUSIC IS FORM THE MID 80'S TO THE 90'S AND BEYOND INTO TODAY...WELL ALOT OF LITTLE GALS SANG ALONG TO THE BEATLES BACK IN THE DAY ...AND THE BEATLES DIDN'T SUCK ! I grew up with another "American Version Release" of this that did not have 'THINGS WE SAID TODAY','ANY TIME AT ALL', 'WHEN I GET HOME',the brutally out of place 'YOU CAN'T DO THAT', and the HELP/1965-like ''ILL BE BACK'..those songs ended up on confusing American releases called 'Second Album' and 'Something new"..or somethin' like that,...OFCOURSE THE REST OF THIS IS AWESOME...MAYBE NOT AS GOOD AS WITH/MEET THE BEATLES...once again the British and American copies are different and it is confusing indeed..ALOT OF GOOD STUFF HERE...I LOVE EARLY STUFF..AND AFTERMATH AND BETWEEN THE BUTTONS STONES TYPE STUFF TOO...BUY THIS !
