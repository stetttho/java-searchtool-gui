 THIS IS ROCK'S FIRST REAL "NASTY" ALBUM...ANGRY PISSED OFF BLUES...HARD TO SAY ITS AHEAD OF IT'S TIME BUT THEN AGAIN IT IS..NOBODY HAD EVER HEARD THE LIKES OF THE SEXUALLY CHARGED STRAY CAT BLUES BEFORE ! THIS IS THE STONES WHITE ALBUM...YET SOMEHOW HERE, THE STONES LEAP AHEAD OF EVEN THE BEATLES AND RELEASE AN UNTOUCHABLE MASTERPIECE OF R N B AGGRESSION...SALT OF THE EARTH MAY BE THE BEST SONG HERE..BUT ITS ALL GOOD G! ; FIVE STARS
