 THE DOORS WALKED INTO A STUDIO IN 1967 AND THEY WALKED OUT WITH A MASTERPIECE...THIS THING IS REALLY REALLY INCREDIBLE BUT NOT SO MUCH FOR JIM MORRISON AS IT IS FOR ROBBIE AND RAY...RAY MANZERAK IS JUST SUCH A TOTAL MUSICIAN...AND ROBBIE'S GUITAR IS LIKE BRIAN JONES ON CRACK! AND THESE SONGS ? WELL..DON'T GET ME STARTED TOO MUCH HERE...THE DOORS PULL NO PUNCHES AND THEY DO NOT MESS WITH YOU FOR LATER (LIKE THE WHO AND OTHER BANDS WOULD DO TO TEASE YOU)...THE DOORS LET IT ALL FLY ON EVERY ALBUM..THEY SHOW YOU THAT THEY ARE THE BEST ON EARTH AND THEY AIN'T MESSIN' AROUND...JIM MORRISON WAS THE FIRST EYES CLOSED TRANSI-NEO KURT COBAIN WITH TONS OF WORDS THAT MADE NO SENSE AND YET SAID IT ALL WITH LOADS OF PAIN AND GLOOMY ALCOHOL SOAKED HATE FOR THE EARTH AND EVERYONE AROUND HIM YET TRYING HIS BEST TO LOVE AND RELATE...THIS GUY WAS A GENIOUS AND HE "HAD" TO CHECK OUT YOUNG...THATS JUST THE WAY IT IS MAN,...THE DOORS ARE PERFECT CHAOS..I KNOW ROBBIE AND JOHN CAN BE BITTER WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT JIM TODAY BUT IT ALL HAD TO BE THIS WAY TO SURVIVE..."EVERYTHING MUST BE THIS WAY" A PERFECT 5 STAR RECORD.
