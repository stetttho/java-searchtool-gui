   The Righteous Brothers hit you with extreme melody and extreme hits ! A memory jarring 60's shake up for your afternoon drive home in the LA traffic on KRTH 101...probobly heard alittle too much but FOR GOOD REASON ; THESE SONGS ARE GREAT ! They go great next to Sam and Dave and Sly and the Family Stone and all that other killer 60's stuff...RICH HARMONYS, SINGING, AND PAINFUL MELODY...its all here from this brilliant 60's duo...No matter how old you are whether yer 18 or 45, you should order this album and devote a good week of time listening to "only " it...then listen to other stuff...and you will see the true talent of the Righteous brothers will stand out in your cd collection !
