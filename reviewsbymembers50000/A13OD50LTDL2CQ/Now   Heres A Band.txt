 The Turtles wrote pop masterpieces along the lines of the Rascals, the Bee Gees, the who, and the Beatles...but this is a special band (like those)...You hear them alot on "oldies" radio like KRTH in Los Angeles...They go nicely , mixed in with all the killer Motown stuff...They can get a bit testy and bitterly angry in some songs (and I like that)...but they kept it poppy for the most part...and occasionally they went too far and they got a bit crappy like Elinore...but I roll up the windows tight in my car and put down the eye protector things (the passenger side one too) to the side and I sing along full blast!YOU WILL TOO -- BUY IT....
