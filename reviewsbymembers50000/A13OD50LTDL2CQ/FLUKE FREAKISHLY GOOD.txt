 IRON MAIDEN HAVE COME OUT OF NOWHERE WITH A STUNNING ALBUM...PEOPLE ARE GONNA ARGUE IT'S NOT ONE OF THEIR BEST BUT CAN YOU TELL ME THE LAST TIME MAIDEN HAD A NEW SONG OUT AS GOOD AS 'NO MORE LIES' ? THE FIRST TWO SONGS SORTA GO RIGHT BY YOU BUT THEN THIS DISC CUTS INTO SOME MEAT AND POTATOES MAIDEN AT THEIR ABSOLUTE BEST...OFCOURSE THE PLAYING IS GOOD,,NO ONE WILL EVER DISPUTE THAT, BUT THESE SONGS ARE FREAKISHLY GOOD FOR RECENT MAIDEN...ITS A BETTER ALBUM THAN BRAVE NEW WORLD...ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I SEE HURTING MAIDEN IS THEY HAVE GOTTEN INTO THIS VERSE CHORUS VERSE SONG STRUCTURE THING WAY WAY TOO MUCH...THE OLD CHAOTIC MAIDEN WAS BETTER...SURE THE YOUNGER MAIDEN COULD WRITE A SONG OR TWO ALSO ...I THINK THIS BAND PEAKED WITH THE MARINER THEN THEY WENT INTO A WHOLE LOTTTA DRAMA AND STUFF WITH MEMBERS COMING AND GOING AND LOTS LOTS LINE UP CHANGES THAT HAVE PROBOBLY TAKEN A BITE OUT'TA MAIDEN'S STADIUM SIZED FOLLOWING...I SAW THEM IN SAN DIEGO AT THE SPORTS ARENA AND THEY WERE BETTER THAN EVER..BUT I WISHED MAIDEN COULD HAVE THE CROWD THE SIZE OF AC/DC'S FROM THE VERY NEXT WEEK CAUSE MAIDEN'S A MUCH BETTER BAND...THEY DESERVE IT...
