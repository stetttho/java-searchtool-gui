   THE WHO SELL OUT IS SO SILLY THAT MOST PEOPLE WON'T ADMIT TO LIKING IT...BUT SECRETLY, THEY TURN THIS THING ON DOWN LOW WHEN NO ONE IS AROUND AND THEY DIG IT MORE THAN ANYTHING...MAYBE MORE THAN SEX OR FOOD.....THIS ALBUM IS SOMEHOW BIZARRELY ROCK'S FIRST VENTURE INTO "PROGRESSIVE ROCK" ARMENIA CITY IN THE SKY, RAEL , I CAN SEE FOR MILES, YOU SUDDENLY REALISE BY ACCIDENT YOU ARE LISTENING TO POSSIBLY THE WHO'S BEST ALBUM >??? WHAT ???  HOW CAN THIS BE ?? THIS THING IS THE PRECURSOR TO PINK FLOYD AND THE DOORS ?? OR DO THE WHO RIP OFF THE DOORS TO WRITE SILAS AND RELAX ?? WITH ALL THE KEYBOARDS, ETC ?? ANYWAY , THE SILLY CONNECTOR JINGLES IN BETWEEN SONGS ONLY ADD TO THE OVERALL CLASSICNESS OF THIS DISC KNOWN AS TOMMY'S MOMMY..the silly little songs like odorono, mary and tattoo basicly amount to the Who f***ing around with the record company's money --BUT IN A NECESSARY ARTISTIC GOOD WAY ! --..THE HEAVY TECHNICAL DRUMMING BY KIETH WITH HIS DOUBLE BASS ON RAEL TRICKS YOU INTO YOU HEARING SOMETHING YOU ARE SURE YOU ARE NOT...HOW IS HE DOING THAT ??? LATER KIETH WILL DISPLAY MORE PARIDIDDLES OF FOOT WORK AND INTERLOCKED RACK MOUNT ROLLS ...BUT SOMEHOW PLAYED AT THE SAME TIME ON LIVE AT LEADS.(AND NEVER DUPLICATED BY ANY OTHER DRUMMER..NOT BOBBY CALDWELL OR NEIL PEART OR PHIL COLLINS OR ANY OF THE CLOWNS IN PUNK AND SPEED METAL BANDS EITHER)..IMAGINE WHAT THIS GUY COULD HAVE BEEN IF HE NEVER TOUCHED ALCOHOL BUT THEN AGAIN, HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE MAD MOON WHOLE PACKAGE---WHAT YA SEE IS WHAT YA GET !! I CAN SEE FOR MILES WILL MORPH INTO 'BARGAIN' AND RAEL WILL DISOLVE INTO 'GOING MOBILE" LATER ON IN WHO'S NEXT WHEN THE WHO GET OLDER AND MORE MATURE FOR ALL YOU TOO COOL STONERS OUT THERE....ANYWAY, THIS IS POSSIBLY ROCK'S ONLY MOMENT OF ROCK 'COMEDY" ..ART , BEFORE FRANK ZAPPA AND THIS THING IS TERRIBLY UNDERDONE (LIKE TOMMY) AND HALF BAKED TO BEAUTIFUL PERFECTION ! BUY IT. NOTE; ON THE EXPANDED VERSION, WE GET THE 1968 SONG MELANCHOLIA WHICH IS THE KILLER WHO WE ALL ALWAYS KNEW WAS THERE ALL ALONG  BUT NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO HEAR...THAT VERSION IS WORTH IT FOR THAT SONG ALONE !
