 THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD THAT I HATE AND I WILL NEVER REVIEW OR RESPECT; ELTON JOHN, MADONNA, GREEN DAY, COLD PLAY, BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, ETC......WELL MICK AIN'T ONE OF THEM...and this here album makes alot of people ticked off at the Stones for scrambling out a quickkie album...to 'make some fast money' but actually THIS IS A GOOD STONES ALBUM WITH SOME GOOD BLUESY STUFF ON IT...NO, ITS NOT SOME GIRLS AND IT CERTAINLY AIN'T TATTOO YOU BY ANY MEANS...BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME STONES HIT SONGS ON IT ...and alot o' JUNK TOO...STILL, IF YOU REALLY GIVE IT A CHANCE , YOU DISCOVER THAT THIS ALBUM IS A SOLID FOUR STARS INDEED....I HATE THE SONG EMOTIONAL RESCUE...BUT I remember it on the radio alot...getting alot of hype and maybe undeserved airplay...but it brings back somewhat fond memories of a time being 15 years old and playing street hockey down at the park...I WOULD THINK YOU SHOULD BUY THIS! 4 STARS......
