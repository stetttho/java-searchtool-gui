 JIM IS "MUSICS" GENIOUS. NOT EXACTLY ROCK N ROLL OR COUNTRY OR SWAMP, JIM CARVES OUT A NEW STYLE CALLED "JIM CROCE"....HE IS THE RADIO POP MASTER AND HE CAN WILL HUGE HIT SONGS AT ANY MOMENT IN THE STUDIO...HE CAN GET TENDER AND ACCOUSTIC ON PHOTOGRAPHS AND MEMORIES AND THEN TURN ON A DIME LIKE WAYNE GRETZKY AND ROCK YOU SILLY WITH SOME LITTLE BAR SONG THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SONG YOU JUST HEARD BEFORE ! THIS GUY IS SO QUIRKY HE PROBOBLY WROTE THE BOOK...HE TELLS STORYS-- AN AMERICAN STORY TELLER..OF FEW WE HAVE IN THIS WORLD TODAY...WE NEED THE RESURRECTION FROM DEATH OF PEOPLE LIKE JIM CROCE...HE WAS KILLED IN A PLANE CRASH LONG AGO IN 1973 AND AT THE TIME, HE WAS SAYING HE WAS GONNA 'CALL IT QUITS" SOON......I PERSONALLY DOUBT IT, JIM WOULD HAVE COME BACK IN 75 OR 76' WITH THE ULTIMATE ROCK ALBUMS AND MAYBE EVEN A ROCK OPERA ! THIS GUY WAS SO DAMN GOOD...HE IS UNTOUCHABLE...MAYBE THIS GUY HERE "IS" / WAS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME...BETTER THAN JOHN LENNON...I DONNO..I LISTEN TO THIS GUY MORE THAN ANYBODY IN MY CD PLAYER..I SWARE TO GOD! THE MARK TWAINE OF ROCK N ROLL !
