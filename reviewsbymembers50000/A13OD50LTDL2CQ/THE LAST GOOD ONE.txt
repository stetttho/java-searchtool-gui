 1988'S 'AND JUSTICE' WOULD BE THE LAST GOOD METALLICA ALBUM AND THE LAST ONE WITH THAT REAL METALLICA VIBE WHERE THEY..THE GUYS IN THE BAND WOULD TRULLY BE IN CONTROL OF METALLICA...THE MUSIC HERE IS PROG, VERY TECHNICAL, AND SUPER RESPECTABLE...LARS DRUMMING IS INCREDIBLE AND DIFFICULT AT THE VERY LEAST...THE SONGS, WITH THE INTERPLAY OF LARS AND JAMES ARE WELL SHALL WE SAY MIND BLOWING...HOW THESE GUYS WENT FROM THIS TO THE PATHETIC BLACK ALBUM METALLICA I WILL NEVER KNOW...BUT COULD A ONE WORD ANSWER BE M-O-N-E-Y ??? THESE GUYS HERE WERE INTO RUSH AND MAIDEN AND THEY WERE PROTECTING THE WORLD FROM LAME MUSIC...METALLICA WOULD EVENTUALLY GIVE IN AND THEY WOULD NOT ONLY BECOME PART OF THE ALTERNATIVE ROCK PROBLEM...THEY WOULD INFACT COME TO EVEN FOLLOW IT AND SEMI-IMITATE IT THEMSELVES WHICH IS A DISASTER...THE YOUNG ACNE FACED STONER GUYS HERE WHO WERE SO COOL WOULD TURN INTO CORPORATE LITTLE FARTS WHO WERE SO LAME LATER ON AND SUCH DICKS...SAD ..STILL, MY MEMORIES OF AND JUSTICE ARE FOND...THIS IS A PROG ALBUM WHEN METALLICA WAS METALLICA...THERE IS NO WAY A BAND LIKE NIRVANA COULD POSSIBLY EXIST WITH AN ALBUM LIKE THIS ON THE CURRENT SCENE AND THEN WITH THESE GUYS TALKING SH*** THE WHOLE WAY ! A CLASSIC !
