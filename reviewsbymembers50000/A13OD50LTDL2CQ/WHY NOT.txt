 AS A GENERAL RULE OF THUMB, IF YOU CAN'T THINK THEN PUNCH...I HAVE OFTEN ENVISIONED MYSELF HANGING OUT AT SOME PARTY I SOMEHOW SNUCK INTO WAY WAY UP IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS OR SOME PLACE...AND THERE IS DON HENLY AND GLEN FREY AT FIRST HAVING A FEW CASUAL DRINKS AND THEN BY THE END OF THE EVENING ARGUING WITH EVERYBODY FOR NOT SUPPORTING THEIR SIERRA CLUB CAUSE OR OTHER BENEFIT OR SOMETHING...THEN THERE ATTENTION TURNS TO ME AND I END OF RUNNING FAST FROM THESE TOO GHOULS DOWN SOME SEEDY ALLEY WAY WAY UP IN BEL AIR...AND I'M THINKIN' THESE TWO GUYS HAVE THE COMBINED BRAIN CELLS THAT ARE ABOUT 50 YEARS BEHIND TOMMY LEE, GEORGE W. BUSH, AND PAMELA ANDERSON COMBINED...AND THEN I WAKE UP ! IT WAS ONLY A DREAM THANK GOD...THEIR MUSIC ?? ITS AWESOME...( DON'T BEAT ME UP GLENN )..."BEST OF MY LOVE" IS A 70'S MEMORY...I CAN HEAR IT PLAYIN' IN MY HEAD WITH TRIPS UP TO LAKE GREGORY AND LAKE ARROWHEAD IN 75' 76' WITH THE DAD N MOM N SIS N BRO...THEN THERES..."Already Gone"...a really cool country like tune that I wish the Dead could have written more songs like...one of my favorite songs is the excellent "Take it to the Limit"...which has a superb sing along melody for the car when yer stuck in traffic on the 405...These guys cleverly combined country, rock and excellent ambiance and killer song writor hooks...definitely a fine tuned skill that the Eagles have over just about every other band on the planet...they somehow pull all this off without sounding at all like the Dead or Jim Croce...I don't think really the Eagles are as good as those other two..BUT IN SOME WEIRD PROFESSIONALISM WAY...THE EAGLES ARE WAY BETTER ! (F..N' LEAVE ME ALONE DON )...ANYWAY..DESPERADO IS THE ONLY SONG HERE THAT I HATE,...BUT IT IS GOOD AND WE HAVE ALL HEARD WITCHY WOMAN ENOUGH TO HAVE THAT TAPE MELTED DOWN AT THE RECORD COMPANYS VAULTS FOREVER...AND EVERY COPY ON EARTH DESTROYED...BUT I WOULD HIDE MY OWN PERSONAL COPY FROM EVERYONE AND I WOULD SELL IT FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW..(IF I'M STILL HERE)...ANYWAY...ANYWAY, I WOULD NEVER HANG OUT WITH THESE TWO GUYS AND THEY WOULD NEVER NEVER NEVER HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME ..OR ONE NICE WORD TO SAY ABOUT ME...BUT THEIR MUSIC IS SPECTACULAR !! BUY THIS...BUT GET MORE INTO THE DEAD, NIEL YOUNG, AND CSNY, ETC....they're cooler dudes
