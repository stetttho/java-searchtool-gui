 THE STONES HAD BEEN PUTTING OUT A FEW CLUNKERS IN THE STUDIO BEFORE THIS ONE...AND THIS CERTAINLY IS A MONSTER COMEBACK AFTER THAT DISASTER CALLED 'STEEL WHEELS'....ITS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIGURE THE STONES OUT....WHY, AT TIMES THEY SUDDENLY TRY TO MESS WITH YOU AND PUT OUT A GREAT ALBUM FOR NO APPARENT REASON ...BUT SELF AMUSEMENT OR SOMETHING....ANYWAY ...UH where do I start??  The aweful "Love is Strong" opens things up here and it is practically the only and last bad thing on this thing,,,,,,,,,,,From there, this album is almost a classic to be put up there with "Exile" ...AND NONE OF YOU MORONS KNOWS IT !!!  THATS THE PART I LOVE !  SINCE AMAZON LETS JUST ABOUT ANYBODY ON HERE TO RANT...AND BELIEVE ME, I'VE SEEN REVIEWERS ON HERE WHO SAY "WHOS' NEXT" IS BLAND AND BORING...AND THE WHITE ALBUM IS OVER-RATED..SO WHY NOT ..UH...Amazon, let me talk too !  I know I get offensively politically incorrect at times...but at this point who gives a sh****t...We're all 40 now...atleast the people who still give a sh** ...  anyway,...this thing has the fabulous Stones classic "New Voices" on it...which apparently is a song about Kurt Cobain !!  The weird part is , it was written probobly just before or right around that weird time that he died...all the ironic stuff going on back then makes the oswald-kennedy-lincoln-John wilkes Booth stuff..(in my life and your lives too !)...look run of the mill weird...like when you drop some item on the ground and it lands straight up  over n over and then someone goes "thats God ...watchin you"...ha he...  anyway , "Brand New car" is a Stones gem...if the lyrics weren't so gross and...THEN THERES THE AWESOME "SWEET HEARTS TOGETHER" AND "THE WORST" WHICH TAKES ME BACK TO "YOU GOT THE SILVER"...OH MAN..IS THIS ALBUM GOOD.........FORGET THOSE OTHER REVIEWS I WROTE WHERE I SAID THE STONES WERE RUNNIN' DRY......THIS HERE THING IS A FULL TANK O' THE 92 OCTANE SH***T...THIS IS REALLY REALLY GOOD !  BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
