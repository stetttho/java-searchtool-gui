 THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS A DISTANT CLASSIC FROM LONG AGO...YET IT IS SO RELEVANT TO TODAY AND EVERY MOMENT OF THE TIMES OF YOUR LIFE..WAR PIGS KNEW IT WAS GOOD THE DAY IT WAS BORN....HAND OF DOOM, ELECTRIC FUNERAL...IT IS A REVOLUTIONARY ALBUM THAT BORROWS FROM ZEPPELIN AND THEN TURNS AND TEACHES ZEPPELIN A THING OR TWO ABOUT A THING OR TWO! IT IS ROUGH (LIKE MUCH OF SABBATH)..THE DRUMMING IS SPECTACULAR AS IT BORROWS ERNESTLY FROM KIETH MOON AND BONHAM...TONI IOMMI IS AN INSTANT GENIOUS SMASH TO BE IMMEDIATELY RECONNED WITH AND THE WEIRD SCARY VOICE OF THE TORTURED OZZY AND HIS TOUGH ENGLISH UPBRINGING  ON HIS SLEEVE---SIMPLY A FIRST IN AWESOME ! VERY GLOOMY...DOOMY..BACK WHEN THIS CAME OUT, THEY ALL KNEW A NUCLEAR WAR WOULD END THEM IN THOSE DAYS EVENTUALLY YET HERE WE ALL ARE STILL HERE !!! MORE THAN ENTERTAINMENT ! THIS WAS THE FIRST 'REALITY' ROCK....WE'RE ALL BETTER BECAUSE OF IT; FIVE STARS.
