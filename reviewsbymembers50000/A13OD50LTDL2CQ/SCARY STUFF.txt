 THIS IS A BRUTAL RECORD...BUT IT IS MELLOW FOR SLAYER ! YOU NEED TO HEAR ANGEL OF DEATH ! THIS IS GOOD THOUGH,...SOME PEOPLE THINK THIS IS WHEN SLAYER STARTED TO SUCK BUT I DON'T ! THIS THING BLOWS AWAY ANY RECORD BY METALLICA ..OR EVEN ANTHRAX...SLAYER IS THE REAL SH***T...I WENT TO A VERY VIOLENT CONCERT OF THEIRS AT THE HOLLYWOOD PALLADIUM IN 88' AND I REMEMBER THE ATMOSPHERE WAS PURE EVIL FRIGHT AT IT'S MOST RIOTOUS...A VERY DISTURBING EVENING INDEED...THE TENSION WAS UNBARABLE...I WAS TERRIFIED...LOMBARDO IS A DOUBLE KICKING MASTER AND KING AND HANEMAN ARE ELECTRIFYING....ALL THE SONGS ARE CLASSIC HERE....ESPECIALLY SOUTH OF HEAVEN AND SILENT SCREAM...I WISH TO GOD THAT THE MUSIC SCENE COULD HAVE STAYED THIS F---ING COOL BUT IT DIDN'T...ALL THOSE LAME COOKY CUTTER SOUND ALIKE ALTERNATIVE BANDS CAME IN WITH THE HELP FROM THE MORONS IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND SADLY, THE REST WAS HISTORY, SLAYER REMAINED GREAT THOUGH ! EVEN ALL THE WAY TO TODAY, SLAYER HAVE NEVER REALLY SOLD OUT AND FOR THE MOST PART, THEY HAVE STAYED TRUE TO THE UNDERGROUND AND THEY HAVE NOT PULLED A METALLICA ON US....I LOVE SLAYER...THEY HAVE KEPT TO BEING THEMSELVES AND THEY HAVE TRIED TO KEEP TO THEMSELVES TOO....THEY GET THE ULTIMATE R-E-S-P-E-C-T ! FIVE STARS !
