   We've all heard these songs 1000 times on the radio but it is for a reason.........to get to the song called; "DIRTY WORK"....ITS a good one, then theres "Any major dude" and lots a' other good clean listening fun here....This band is comprised of great musicians and quality songwriting that can get tedious and old ...but only after 1000 plays so..if yer not familiar with this, then I HIGHLY recommend you get INTO IT...IT WILL CHANGE YOU...IF YER STUCK ON 90'S PUNK ROCK, THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO BREAK FREE AND GROW UP STUPID and get out OF IT...THIS IS STEELY DAN...THIS AIN'T DIRE STRAIGHTS OR MTV OR STING...GET INTO THIS ...and get into Chicago...MAKE THAT BREAK NOW FROM LAME ALTERNATIVE ROCK WHILE YOU CAN ...before it destroys yer life and turns you into a 'life time boy" ...and you wake up at 40 where you WERE AT 26...UPSTAIRS IN YOUR BEDROOM NEXT TO YOUR MOTHER'S ROOM !
