 THE MONKEES WEREN'T A REAL GROUP BUT THEY WERE. THEY WERE A COMPLETE RIP ON THE BEATLES BUT THEY WEREN'T. THEY WERE FOOLISH TO VOLUNTEER TO BE CHOSEN TO BE MONKEES FOR US ALL...BUT IT WAS ALL MEANT TO BE AND THANK GOD THAT THEY DID ! THESE 'FAKES' WERE ONE OF THE GREATEST 'BANDS' OF ALL TIME...LIKE THE RUTLES WHO WOULD COME AFTER THEM LATER, THE MONKEES WERE A SPOOF ON THE BEATLES...BUT A SPOOF GONE BAD; THEY BECAME REAL. AND THEY BECAME "REAL"....LIKE THE CREW OF STAR TREK REALLY FLYING THE SPACE SHUTTLE OR SOMETHIN' LIKE THIS MICKEY DOLENZ WOULD OFTEN MUMBLE...THE MONKEES ARE MORE REAL THAN ANY NERD TREKKIE ! THEY ARE A REAL ROCK N ROLL BAND...AND EVENTUALLY THEY WOULD ATTEMPT (AND SUCCEED!) AT PLAYING ALL THE INSTRUMENTS NECESSARY TO BE REAL MONKEES...THE SONGS?????? WOW ??? YOU GOTTA "HEAR" "THESE GUYS"....ONE OF THE FUNNIEST THINGS ABOUT THE MONKEES IS THAT THEY HAVE SO MANY GOOD LITTLE SONGS THAT DON'T END UP ON ALL THEIR MULTITUDES OF GREATEST HITS PACKAGES LIKE "WORDS...THAT NEVER WERE TRUE"...SUCHY A CATCHY PSYCHEDELIC DIDDY..."PLEASANT VALLEY SUNDAY"....OH IF I ONLY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THAT RECORD DEAL BACK IN 90 OR 91 ! OH THE MUSIC YOU PEOPLE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TO HEAR ! I SURELY WOULD HAVE MIXED SOME MONKEES IN WITH MY WHO, RUSH, AND BOWIE ...AND I WOULDN'T HAVE SUCKED LIKE GREEN DAY EITHER!!!  THESE GUYS RULE !!! FIVE STARS !!!--CLARK HAGINS 8-12-2005
