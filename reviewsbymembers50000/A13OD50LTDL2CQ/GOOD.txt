 THIS IS A SURPRISE ! THE SO CALLED "THREE PIECE" VERSION OF GENESIS IS BORN ! (ACTUALLY IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT GENESIS REALLY JUST REBECAME A FIVE PIECE AGAIN (AGAIN) FOR LIVE TOURS ...BUT YES...IN THE STUDIO , THEY WERE JUST A THREESOME !) THIS ALBUM IS VERY INVOLVED AND STILL VERY PROG ! THE VERY FIRST TRACK IS A COMPLICATED DIDDY INDEED CALLED 'DOWN AND OUT' THAT SCREWS ALONG IN A VERY DIFFICULT TIME SIGNATURE AND ALMOST FALLS APART BUT NEVER QUITE DOES...THE ABSENSE OF STEVE HACKET IS EVIDENT YET HE IS SOMEHOW NOT MISSED (YET)...GENESIS DOUBTERS AT THE TIME MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH THIS ALBUM WHICH SORT OF SIGNALS 'THE END'...BUT INDEED AS HISTORY PROVED , IT CERTAINLY DID NOT ! THE NEXT ALBUM AFTER THIS "DUKE" IS ALMOST A GENESIS CLASSIC IF NOT FOR THE REALLY LAME CORPORATE DIRECTION EEKING IN SLOWLY...THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS RATHER ENJOYABLE AND SOMEWHAT OF A SHOCK...ITS REALLY GOOD ! NOT QUITE COMMERCIAL YET AND THE INSTRUMENT PLAYING IS REALLY IN YOUR FACE ESPECIALLY ON BURNING ROPE. BALLAD OF BIG, SCENES FROM A NIGHT'S DREAM AND THE A TRICK OF A TAIL LIKE SNOWBOUND.  I RECOMMEND THIS.
