 Alot of people have panned this album as a Doors weak link...and even back in it's day, it took abuse from some critics as too mellow for the Doors...It does contain the doors classic "Touch Me"...and over all it has a sort-of weird yet 'non-psychedelic' rock opera feel to it...It was interesting to watch a super confident band like the Doors suddenly struggle and try to copy all the bands around them like the Who..bands that in the studio atleast, the Doors always dominated...now, the Doors seemed alittle unsure...which was odd indeed..ofcourse Morrison was having super drama problems and problems with alcohol and whatnot in these days of the soft parade and that is evident here,,,,,"Wishful Sinful' is a great doors song and it is here so is the mini who like opera 'the Soft Parade" at the end...its Doors 'experimentation' and it is that album (sorta like the stones their satanic majesties) that every 60's band 'had to do' as a semi-rite of passage..to get to their next blues era........THIS IS A GOOD ONE THOUGH...YOU SHOULD PURCHASE THIS FINE FOUR STAR DOORS ALBUM !
