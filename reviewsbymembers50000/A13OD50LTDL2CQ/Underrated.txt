 This is the band that the Who blew off the stage on that 67' tour ...but in reality, Herman had better songs...THE WHO JUST HAD THE BETTER STAGE ACT...AND IN THE LONG RUN, WHAT THEY SAY IS TRUE....You gotta' knock em' dead Live !...but Herman gets my respect...lots a hit songs ...and even some angry punk like (sorta like the Turtles and Hollies) garage band rocking...NOW TRYING TO ROCK WITH THE WHO...NOW, THATS A BAD IDEA...and after that tour , little was really heard again from Herman...and lots was heard from the Who, still...I'll always like Herman...'NO MILK TODAY' AND 'LISTEN PEOPLE"....CRAPPY POP AT IT'S FINEST !...Really goes good on those sunday afternoons with the barbeque at 251 with the BH....alongside cool stuff from maybe Headquarters by Monkees...give your money to these guys at amazon...not Rap or some MTV pap like Coldplay.
