 Traffic's "Low Spark" is a masterpiece containing a buncha' good stuff ...the long "low Spark" and the killer song "Rock n Roll stew' are among the fine output by this 70's gang. Somewhat similar to another group you might have heard of called Steely Dan....They were kinda prog ..and you need to order a copy of this album for certain...We need music like this today in the world and no...I don't mean Dave Mathews band...there are good groups out there playin' in bars all over America...the record companys need to find groups out there like Traffic and Steely, ...perhaps what we need to do as fans is write letters and e-mails to the record companys and get these a & r people that they currently have ; OUT OF THERE AND HIRE SOME CREATIVE PEOPLE WITH REAL EYE FOR TALENT (FORGET THE POLITICS)...JUST HIRE TALENT AND SONGWRITING THAT SOUNDS LIKE NOTHING ELSE...THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU WOULD WANT...AND FER'GET RECORD SALES FOR NOW...IN THE NAME OF SAVING THE MUSIC CALLED ROCK N ROLL...WE NEED TO SEEK OUT BANDS OUT THERE PLAYIN IN CLUBS SOMEWHERE LIKE TRAFFIC...Maybe look in Europe..We have to Find them...otherwise rock has not much time left...you can't keep recycling these lame 90's aging bands forever (Greenday, Foo Fighters, Weezer, Gwen, Backstreet Boys, etc, rap)...you can't trick people forever...maybe for 5 years or ten...BUT NOT FOREVER...EVENTUALLY WE NEED REAL CHANGE IN THE MUSIC AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY....THERES A TRAFFIC OUT THERE !
