 THIS IS ONE OF ROCK'S SO CALLED 'UBER-ALBUMS' ALONG WITH PET SOUNDS BY THE BEACH BOYS AND I KNOW YER ALL SICK OF PEOPLE BABBLING ABOUT AND REVIEWING THESE ALBUMS OVER N OVER BUT I HAVE TO SO HERE IT GOES......I MAINLY LIKE THIS ALBUM SO MUCH BECAUSE I DISTANTLY REMEMBER IT FROM WHEN I WAS FOUR OR 5, THE YEAR WAS 1969 OR 70' AND ONE OF MY OLDER BROTHERS OR SISTERS 'LEFT' THE ALBUM OUT IN THE LIVING ROOM FOR ME TO 'DISCOVER' THERE ALL ALONE...AS THE LITTLE ALMOST TODDLER I WAS, I WOULD PLAY THIS ALBUM...TURNS OUT..WHAT I HAD WAS THE 'AMERICAN' VERSION...NOT THE ONE WITH 'NOWHERE MAN" !! AND APPARENTLY, I WOULD PLAY IT OUT THERE ALL ALONE ENDLESSLY..TIL ONE DAY I WALKED OUT AND I FOUND THE RECORD BROKEN (hmmm)...and was that my first sad moment??)...AND I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS...I REMEMBERED THE MELODIES AND ALL THE JUICY SONGWRITOR PARTS FROM SONGS LIKE 'ITS ONLY LOVE" AS I GREW ...A FEW YEARS LATER IN 73' WHEN THE BIG BLUE AND RED CAPITAL 'BEST OFS' WERE COMING OUT...THATS WHEN WE ALL WENT INTO BEATLES HEAVEN AROUND MY NEIGHBORHOOD..ITS ALL HERE...MICHELLE, DRIVE MY CAR (ALSO NOT ON MY BROKEN VERSION), BUT THANK GOD THE KILLER 'WAIT' WAS AND THE STUPID RINGO TUNE WASN'T ; A CLASSIC ...FIVE STARS
