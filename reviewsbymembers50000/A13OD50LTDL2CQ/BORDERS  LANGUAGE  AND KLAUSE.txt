 THIS ALBUM BASICLY DEFINES P-E-R-F-E-C-T-I-O-N!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW HERES A ROCK N ROLL ALBUM PEOPLE !!! THIS THING IS AWESOME ! I GREW UP WITH THIS DISC FULL OF PURE HATE, RAGE, SADNESS, UNBELIEVABLE PAIN AND SINCERITY...SURE, ITS KINDA CHEESEY AND SILLY...BUT I LOVED THIS THING IN 1985 ..AND I LOVE THIS THING IN 2005 ! "RIDE THE F***ING LIGHTNING, METALLICA !!!"" ..PROBOBLY EVEN GREATER THAN 'PUPPETS AND AND JUSTICE...THIS ALBUM RAGES FROM THE VERY START AND HARDLY LETS UP...IT SPEWS HATE AT VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING...AT SOCIETY, AT LAME CHICKS, AT LAME PEOPLE...IT IS SO PACKED AND FULL OF DEPRESSION...IT MAKES THE CURE SEEM LIKE THE FRICKIN BAY CITY ROLLERS!!! I LOVE EARLY METALLICA ! MY EMAIL IS BESIEGED WITH HAPPY PEOPLE TODAY ABOUT LAST NIGHT'S REVIEW OF THE AWEFUL CORPORATE BLACK ALBUM...THEY SAY I 'HAD' TO GET IT OFF MY CHEST...BUT HONESTLY,...THAT WASN'T IT---I MEANT IT !...THERE ARE ANGRY PEOPLE TOO....BUT EVERYBODY AGREES WITH ME..OVER ALL IN GENERAL...AND IN THE NAME OF ENTERTAINMENT...NOTHING IS WRONG...USUALLY...ANYWAY....ANYWAY, AS SOME MORON PRESIDENT HAS OUR BORDERS WIDE OPEN FOR US SITTING HERE AS SITTING DUCKS...A COOL ANGRY ARMY NAMED OLD METALLICA WILL ALWAYS BE THERE TO DEFEND US...LIKE THE METAL MILITARY THEY ONCE WERE...THEY SWIRL IN OUR BRAINS ...AND THEY FILL US WITH PASSION ! THEY FILL US WITH PRIDE AND SELF DEFENSE...SURE , THEY SUCK NOW TODAY...BUT THE OLD METALLICA WILL LIVE ON FOREVER IN OUR HEARTS..."FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE"....
