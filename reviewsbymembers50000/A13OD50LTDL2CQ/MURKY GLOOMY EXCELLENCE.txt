 "THE LAMB" IS GENESIS'S QUADROPHENIA...THIS ALBUM IS GLOOMY, DEPRESSING, AND SCARY...AND IT IS GABRIEL ERA GENESIS AT THEIR ABSOLUTE BEST ! EVERY SONG IS A CLASSIC...AND AS YOU LISTEN TO THIS THING YOU GET SUCKED INTO IT AND YOU BEGIN TO "LIVE' IT...THERE IS PROFANE ANGST AND BITTERNESS IN GABRIEL THAT IS RIDICULOUSLY AHEAD OF IT'S TIME...(THE FIRST PETER GABRIEL ALBUM (A CLASSIC IN ITSELF) SOUNDS NOTHING LIKE THIS...THOUGH THE FOUR OTHER GENESIS MEMBERS SEEM TO BE SOMEWHAT GABRIEL SLAVES HERE...IT STILL ALL WORKS AND IS WORTH THE DICTATORSHIP ! PEOPLE INTO CORPORATE 90'S STUFF LIKE MARILYN MANSON AND NINE INCH NAILS NEED TO REALISE THIS IS WHERE THAT BEGAN ! THIS IS THE REAL ANGER AND PURE FOCUSED CONFUSION...ONE OF ROCK'S ALL TIME CLASSIC ALBUMS !
