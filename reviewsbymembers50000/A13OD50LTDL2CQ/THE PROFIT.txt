AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ZAPPA....THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THIS GUY...IN 1968, HE HIT THE SCENE..USELESS TO SAY HE WAS AHEAD OF HIS TIME AND HE WAS....SO UTTERLY RIDICULOUS OF A HUMAN BEING AND SUCH BEAUTIFUL (AND TECHNICALLY TOO AT TIMES!--SUPER WELL PLAYED) MUSIC...I'LL NEVER FERGE'T SEEIN HIM PLAY DANCIN FOOL ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE AND I WAS JUST SITTIN THERE SAYIN....'GENIOUS' IN MY MIND...BUY IT !
