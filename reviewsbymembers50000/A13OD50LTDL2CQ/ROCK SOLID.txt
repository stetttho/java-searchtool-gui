 ITS ACTUALLY NOT AS GOOD AS KILLERS WITH DIANO BUT.......AND THIS IS A BIG BIG BUT..THIS 'IS' KILLER !! ITS THE DEBUT WITH BRUCE AND HE IMMEDIATELY LETS IT BE KNOWN HE IS THE SH** HERE...STEVE HARRIS IS UNBELIEVABLE (AS USUAL)...AND THE TWIN GUITAR ATTACK IS TIGHT ...DAVE MURRAY IS SPECTACULAR AND ADRIAN SMITH MORE THAN KEEPS UP...THE REAL STAR OF MAIDEN THOUGH...AND I MEAN IN ALL THEIR VARIOUS LINE-UPS IS CLIVE BURR...THIS GUY IS ONE OF THE MOST PURE TRUE DRUMMERS OF ALL TIME...I STILL DON'T EXACTLY KNOW THE STORY OF HOW HE SLIPPED AWAY FROM MAIDEN...AND I WISH THEY COULD HAVE GOT DIANO BACK WHEN BRUCE LEFT ! THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AWESOME ! 666 - THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST, INVADERS..AND PIECE OF MIND after this IS GOOD TOO...THOUGH BRUCE WOULD TIRE ON EVERYBODY WITH HIS ANTICS, HE IS TRULLY REALLY TALENTED AND GOOD AND HE DESERVES TO HAVE THE BIG MOUTH...SO PEOPLE SHOULD LEAVE HIM ALONE...I SAY JUST LET PEOPLE BE...PEOPLE THAT DESERVE IT WHO HAVE OBVIOUS TALENT...NOT THESE GUITAR AND A HAIRCUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOME FRIEND AT WARNER BROS or somethin' THAT GOT THEM A RECORD DEAL CAUSE THEY'RE CUTE..YA KNOW , SWITCH FOOT, WE CAN DO WITHOUT THEM...BUT MAIDEN RULE !!! FIVE STARS !
