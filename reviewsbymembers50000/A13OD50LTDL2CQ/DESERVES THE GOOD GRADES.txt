 ALOT OF PEOPLE PAN THIS "LAME" GOOD WHO ALBUM...THEY ARGUE THAT IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS TOMMY, LEADS, WHOS NEXT, AND QUADROPHENIA...AND THEY SAY INFACT IN SOME CIRCLES...'THIS IS NOT REAL WHO !!!"...WELL IT IS ! SURE,...THE TITLE TRACK 'WHO ARE YOU' IS AS ANNOYING AS FM ROCK GETS......AND KIETH MOON STRUGGLES THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH THIS THING...BUT HE ENDS UP DOING VERY WELL..FOR A GUY WHO IS DYING AT THE TIME!...THE ACUTE ALCOHOLISM THAT WOULD KILL MOON AND JOHN BONHAM WOULD ALSO ALMOST TAKE PETE A SHORT WHILE AFTER THIS...PETE BARELY MADE IT...YOU PARTY ROCKERS OUT THERE TAKE NOTE...BON SCOTT TOO WENT DOWN AROUND THIS TIME AS WELL..ANYWAY, THIS REALLY 'IS' A GREAT WHO ALBUM TO BE PUT UP WITH ALL THEIR BEST..IT AIN'T A KENNY JONES ERA ONE...THOUGH TODAY NOW, IT IS GETTING CONFUSING HERE IN THESE DISTANT TIMES LIGHT YEARS AWAY FROM THE 70'S.....'NEW SONG', 'SISTER DISCO', THE ENTWISTLE 905 AND JOHN'S 'HAD ENOUGH'...IT REALLY IS A CLASSIC ALBUM ..AND ALL THESE A**HOLES FROM THE MEDIA SHOULD LEAVE THE WHO ALONE...THEY'RE A WAY BETTER BAND SITTIN' ON THE TOILET BACK STAGE THAN ANY OF THESE CORPORATE ALTERNATIVE ROCK BANDS OF THE 90'S AND TODAY...WE REALLY NEED TO , AS MUSIC FANS, TELL THESE RECORD COMPANYS TO QUIT SIGNING THESE PISS BANDS FROM TODAY AND SEEK OUT REAL TALENT OUT THERE (IF THERE IS ANY NOW)...LIKE THE WHO !
