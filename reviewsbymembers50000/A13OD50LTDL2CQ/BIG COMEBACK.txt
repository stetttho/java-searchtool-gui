 I JUST SAW THESE GUYS AT THE SAN DIEGO SPORTS ARENA...AND WOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT A FRICKIN GIG IT WAS ! I SAW MOTLEY CRUE TOO ..AND I THINK THE DURANERS GAVE THEM A BIG RUN FOR THEIR MONEY...MAYBE EVEN BETTER...ALOT OF THE NEW SONGS ARE KILLER ! 'REACH UP FOR THE SUNRISE' WOW...THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM...AND THE TOUR WAS AWESOME...IF YOU EVER HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE THESE GUYS LIVE I RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO ! I HAVE ALWAYS HAD GREAT GREAT RESPECT FOR DURAN...THESE GUYS HAVE GOTTEN LAID ALOT !!!!!!!!!!!! AND FOR DAMN GOOD REASON..THEY ARE TALENTED AND THEY WRITE GREAT SONGS...WHAT MEMORIES FROM THE 80'S ALA THE CURE !!! HELL YEAH I LOVE DURAN !! ..BUY THIS AND THEIR GREATEST HITS..THEY WILL BE ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE BANDS OVER TIME; TRUST ME !!!
