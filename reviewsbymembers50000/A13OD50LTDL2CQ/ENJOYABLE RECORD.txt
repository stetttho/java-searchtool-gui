 LED ZEPPELIN THREE IS A BIT OF A SURPRISE...ITS NOT ALL THAT HEAVY..AND ZEP AT THE TIME WERE TAKING A BRUISING BEATING FROM CRITICS JUST FOR BEING THE MIGHTY ZEP...AND THATS NOT FAIR ! SO ZEP DECIDED TO THROW YOU ALL A CURVE BALL WITH THIS 'MELLOW ZEP ALBUM'..AND IT'S GOT GREAT STUFF! 'SINCE I'VE BEEN LOVING YOU' AND TANGERINE...THIS IS ZEP'S WHO BY NUMBERS ! AND TO THINK , THIS IS AN EARLY ZEP RECORD TOO ! IT CAN GET HEAVY AT TIMES...IT'S GOT IMMIGRANT SONG DON'T FORGET...ITS ACCOUSTIC AND MELODIC AND PLANT'S  SCRATCHY VOCALS FROM ALL THE TOURING MIGHT BE IT'S ONE FALL BACK...OVER ALL THOUGH, I LIKE ZEP THREE..WHILE EVERYBODY WAS PUTTING OUT HEAVY RECORDS IN 1970 TRYING TO OUT HEAVY EACH OTHER, ZEP SIMPLY RELAXED AND RELEASED A NATURAL RECORD RELEASE...LAUGHING AT THE REST OF THE PACK...AND SHOWING THAT ZEP DOES NOT NEED TO OBEY ANYONE!
