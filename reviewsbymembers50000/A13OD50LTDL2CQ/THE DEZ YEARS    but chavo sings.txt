 I HAVE OFTEN SAID THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ATLEAST HALF THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE LAST 45 YEARS OF ROCK N ROLL AS THE SHARK (AND OLDER BROTHERS AND FAMILY FRIENDS THAT HUMILIATED AND BEAT THE SH** OUT OF YOU ..AND ATLEAST MUCH OF THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD AROUND YOU HATED YOU FOR NO APPARENT REASON SINCE YOU WERE FOUR OR FIVE) THEN YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE A RECORD DEAL IN THE FIRST PLACE... AND IF YER SOME JOCK COVERED IN TATTOOS WHO IS A RECENT 'CONVERT' TO THE MTV/VH-1 ALTERNA-CUM-PAP N ROLL WITH THE MENTAL COPACITY OF THE E-CHANNEL...YA KNOW..ONE OF THOSE MORONS THAT'L THREATEN TO BEAT YOU UP IF YA AIN'T PRO-GAY AND PRO-CHOICE AND YOU DON'T GOOSE STEP TO THEIR PLAN OF KINDER GENTLER WORLD MARXISM... WELL , BLACK FLAG UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THIS, THEY WERE SOMEWHAT LEFT OF CENTER TYPES ...BUT THEY MAINLY JUST WANTED TO MAKE NOISE AND ROCK OUT WITH VERY LITTLE 'TICKS' AT ALL...THIS IS A 'DEZ ERA' FLAG ALBUM...BEFORE HANK ,WITH RON (CHAVO) SINGING ON HIS ONE AND ONLY FLAG ALBUM...DEZ WOULD SOON JOIN AND PLAY SOME GUITAR TOO..AND HE WOULD SING THESE 'JEALOUS AGAIN" SONGS TOO...and that would confuse you flaggies out there indeed... AND IT IS RATHER ANGRY AND ENJOYABLE OF A LISTEN...IT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES TOO....IT HAS A SONG WITH CHUCK SINGING LEAD...AND IT HAS IT ALL...it goes by pretty quick so you gotta pay attention...the guitar of Ginn is first rate  .......ORDER YOUR COPY TODAY !
