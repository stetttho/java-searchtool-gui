 WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE BEST GENESIS ALBUM WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE THEY RECORD "AFTER" GABRIEL LEAVES THE BAND ! THIS ALBUM HAS VERY LITTLE IN COMMON WITH 'THE LAMB'. IT IS MORE SIMILAR TO SELLING ENGLAND BY THE POUND IN SOME STRANGE WAY...PHIL COLLINS' DRUMMING HERE IS HIS BEST YET AND STEVE HACKET IS SIMPLY IN A CLASS ALL BY HIMSELF ON GUITAR..BANKS AND RUTHERFORD ARE BRILLIANT AS USUAL...AND THE SONGS!! WOW...THESE ARE ANTHEMS..DANCE ON A VOLCANO..AND THEN IT JUST GETS BETTER FROM THERE..NEVER AGAIN WOULD GENESIS RECORD A PROJECT QUITE THIS GOOD...THE SONG WRITING HERE IS VERY INVOLVED AND BEYOND COMPLEX..'BLOWS AWAY RAP OR ALTERNATIVE ROCK COMPLETELY
