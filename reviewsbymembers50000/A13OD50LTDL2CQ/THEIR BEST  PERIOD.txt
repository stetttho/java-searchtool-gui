 THIS ALBUM IS SO GOOD THAT EVEN RUSH THEMSELVES AREN'T QUITE SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF IT...WHEN RUSH RECORDED THIS ALBUM, THEY HAD THEIR STRUGGLES AND PERIODS OF WRITOR'S BLOCK...IN ESSENCE, RUSH GOT CONFUSED...THE RESULT IS A CLASSIC...ITS A MINI-ROCK OPERA THAT IS VERY ENJOYABLE TO LISTEN TO AS IT GOES ROUND AND ROUND WITH IDEAS AND MESSES WITH YOUR MIND...AND THATS WHEN YOU'RE NOT EVEN STONED ! I HAVE GREAT MEMORIES OF GROWING UP AND LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM WHENEVER AND WHERE EVER...IN THE BATH TUB OR IN THE TRUCK...THIS THING IS A CLASSIC ! SOMEHOW BETTER THAN 2112 (AND BELIEVE ME...THAT IS DIFFICULT !) OR PERMENANT WAVES.........THIS IS ROCK AND ROLL WHEN ARENA ROCK RULED AND THIS IS WHY !
