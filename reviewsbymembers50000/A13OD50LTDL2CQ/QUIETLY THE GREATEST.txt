 IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A BEE GEES "GREATEST HITS" ALBUM REALLY BECAUSE THERE ARE SIMPLY TOO MANY GREAT SONGS DATING BACK NEARLY 40 YEARS BY JUST ONE INCREDIBLE GROUP...THE HARMONYS ARE SO TIGHT...THE MELODYS ARE LIKE NOTHING ELSE ON PLANET EARTH...THAT DUDE IN ELO SAID THAT ALL ALONG HE WAS RIPPING OFF THE BEE GEES NOT THE BEATLES...BECAUSE THE BEE GEES WERE BETTER...AND I TRUST HIM. EVERY TIME I HEAR A BEE GEES SONG ON THE RADIO, MY PAIN AND ANY PROBLEMS OR SADNESS I HAVE OR HAVE EVER HAD SIMPLY DISAPPEARS FOR A FEW MOMENTS AS I LISTEN IN AMAZEMENT TO THE TWO OR THREE MINUTES OF SONGCRAFT BEFORE MY EAGER EARS....THE BEE GEES ARE THE GREATEST...THEY MAKE YOU WANNA HEAR MORE AND THEY MAKE YOU WANNA GO RECORD A SONG RIGHT NOW ! I DARE YOU TO BE AS GOOD AS THEM .......IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE ; 5 STARS
