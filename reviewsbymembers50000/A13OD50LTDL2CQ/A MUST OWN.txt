   This "Stones Double album" (in the late 60's/70's every super band was obligated to do one) is in reality over hyped , overblown and overrated...THAT BEING SAID IT IS A CLASSIC WITH "Sweet Virginia", 'Rip this joint'...and a buncha good connector songs inbetween the obvious huge hits here like Tumblin' Dice...It has the excellent confessional Mick songs like "shine a Light' and 'I just want to see His face'...DURING THIS PHASE THE STONES WERE HAVING LOTS O' PROBLEMS...and this album releases the tension and reveals just about all in the Stones drama...it brings back alot of memories, this fine album ...but alot of people feel it drags and does not rock with Sticky Fingers and Let it Bleed...I DISAGREE...I LIKE TO KICK BACK AND LISTEN TO THIS...ITS GOT THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY,...IT REALLY REALLY 'ISN'T' THE STONES' WHITE ALBUM AT ALL...IT IS SOMETHING ELSE INDEED---FIVE STARS...
