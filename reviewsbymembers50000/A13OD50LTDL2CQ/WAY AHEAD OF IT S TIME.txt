 QUADROPHENIA IS ROCK AND ROLL'S MOMENT OF BRILLIANCE....IT IS EVERY ROCK N ROLL BAND COMING TOGETHER AND COLLIDING IN AN ALMOST CLASSICAL MUSIC SETTING COLAGE OF ANGER AND PASSION...IT IS GRAY, COLD , GLOOMY, MURKY...YET CONNECTED ENGENIOUSLY BY INTERLOCKING "THEMES" WITHIN THEMES...IT IS A TOUGH SELL TO THE FICKLE AND VERY YOUNG AND NAIVE AND THAT IS GOOD ! IT IS MATURE ROCK WAY AHEAD OF 1973! IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE MUSIC FROM 1982 ! WHERE TOMMY SOUNDS UNDERDONE AND A LITTLE BEHIND THE TIMES, QUADROPHENIA SOUNDS CRAZY AND WAY AHEAD OF ALL OF US ! THIS THING IS LIKE BEETHOVEN ! EVEN IF IT IS 90 DEGREES OUTSIDE, QUADROPHENIA CAN MAKE YOUR HOUSE FEEL COLD AND RAINY YET YOU LIKE IT AND YOU SETTLE IN AND YOU DEAL WITH IT; THE PAIN....KIETH MOON'S DRUMMING TAKES EVERY SONG TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL AND PETE TOWNSHENDS GUITAR AND KEYBOARDS ARE A PHIL SPECTER LIKE WALL OF ENERGY AND INTERTWINEMENT...THE SONGS ARE HEAVY AND MEAN..FULL OF SWEARING AND PRIDE...THE BASS PLAYING IS... WELL SIMPLY REVOLUTIONARY...THE MIX IS POOR AND THE RECORDING IS DREADFULLY AWEFUL BUT IT ALL HAD TO BE THIS WAY FOR AN ALBUM OF PURE CHAOS THAT TOOK ROCK TO STUNNING NEW TERRITORY !
