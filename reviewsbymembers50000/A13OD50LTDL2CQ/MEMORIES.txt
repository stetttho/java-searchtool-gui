 THIS IS THE DAVID BOWIE 'COVERS' ALBUM FROM THE EARLY 70'S AND IT IS GOOD. I REMEMBER MY BROTHER IN HIS VARIOUS BANDS PLAYING THEIR VERSIONS OF BOWIE'S VERSION OF 'ROSALYN"...AND I CAN REMEMBER THE DANCE HALLS ROCKING IN 1979 TO 80-ISH ERA CIRCA AROUND TORRANCE AND THE S. BAY.....ALOT OF PUNKER AND NEW WAVE BANDS WERE INTO THIS...AND YOU CAN TELL THE CARS AND DEVO AND ALOT OF PEOPLE DUG BOWIE ESPECIALLY THIS ALBUM...BOWIE BUTCHERS A COUPLE OF WHO SONGS HERE BUT ITS ALL FUN...HIS COVER OF PINK FLOYDS SEE EMILY PLAY IS BETTER THAN SYD BARRET'S ORIGINAL AND SYD BARRET'S WAS KILLER ! FRIDAY ON MY MIND COMPLETELY ROCKS...THERE IS NO BETTER BOWIE SONG THAN THIS!--AND 'HERE COMES THE NIGHT' AND 'SORROW' ARE AWESOME...THE LET DOWN HERE MIGHT BE THE KINKS 'WHERE HAVE ALL THE GOOD TIMES GONE" LATER DONE WELL BY VAN HALEN AND DIAMOND DAVE...BUT THIS HERE DAVE CAN ROCK TOO; FOUR STARS !
