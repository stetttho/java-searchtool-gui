   DELTA DAWN HIT IN 1972 WHEN TANYA WAS THE RIPE OLD AGE OF 13...AND THESE SONGS AND ALL THEIR MEMORIES GET ROLLING IN YOUR BRAIN FROM THERE...LOVES THE ANSWER AND WHATS YOUR MAMA'S NAME I CAN HERE SPINNING AROUND IN MY HEAD FROM THE DISTANT 70'S DAYS OF HEARING THESE SONGS PLAYED AMONG OTHER COUNTRY STANDARDS BY MY DAD OUT ON HIS STEREO WHEN I WAS A WEE LITTLE KID INTO SHARKS AND STAR WARS....HER LIKE NO OTHER VOICE AND HER ENCHANTING LOOKS EASILY TOOK HER TO THE COMPETITIVE TOP OF THIS COUNTRY GAME...SHE IS BASICLY THE FEMALE VERSION OF DAVID BOWIE AND FEW PEOPLE REALISE THIS...DON'T BELIEVE ME?? LISTEN TO THE PATSY CLINE LIKE 'WOULD YOU LAY WITH ME'...AND MANY OTHERS...SOME OF THE SYRUPPY BACKING VOCALS I CAN DO WITHOUT BUT I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT ABOUT COUNTRY ...STILL, THIS BEAUTY OF A COUNTRY GAL PACKS ALOT OF SEX AND SASS (CLEAN SEX THOUGH !)...FOR AS BITTER AND NASTY AS TANYA GETS, SHE KEEPS IT CONSERVATIVE AS HELL...BUY THIS NOW !...BLOOD RED AND GOIN' DOWN ALONE MAKES IT WORTH IT ...--CLARK HAGINS
