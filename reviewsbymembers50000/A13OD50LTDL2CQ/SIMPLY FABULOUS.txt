 WITH ALL THE LAME ELECTRONIC HIP HOP AND ALTERNATIVE OF TODAY, ITS SO REFRESHING TO HEAR 'REAL MUSIC" LIKE PATSY CLINE...THIS GAL WAS A RARE TALENT AND HER VOICE HAS NEVER BEEN DUPLICATED..THOUGH LORETTA LYNN AND TANYA TUCKER ARE GOOD...THEY STILL DON'T COME CLOSE TO THIS...'BACK IN BABY'S ARMS' AND STRANGE...HOW YOU STOPPED LOVING ME...HOW YOU STOPPED WANTING ME...IT MAKES YOU CRY...INDEED...GOD TOOK THIS LADY AWAY FROM US IN A PLANE CRASH BACK IN THE DAYS THAT IT SEEMED THEY WERE ALL DYING IN PLANE CRASHES...MY DAD WOULD PLAY CRAZY OVER AND OVER OUT IN THE FRONT ROOM...BUT I WOULD LATER GET THIS DISC AND START 'LEARNING' MORE ABOUT PATSY CLINE AND THEN I WOULD BEGIN COLLECTING ALL HER RECORDS...THE 60'S WERE SO GREAT...I WONDER WHAT HIT SONGS WERE TO COME FROM THIS GENIOUS....
