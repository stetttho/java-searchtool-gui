 THIS THING IS KILLER ! IF YOU BUY THIS HERE ALBUM FROM AMAZON...BE PREPARED TO HEAR "CHILDREN OF THE GRAVE' ONE OF THE GREATEST BLACK SABBATH SONGS EVER WRITTEN (AND ONE OF ROCK'S BEST SONGS PERIOD!)...THIS WHOLE ALBUM TAKES THOSE FIRST TWO SABBATH RECORDS TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL...OFCOURSE THERE,S SWEET LEAF...WITH IT'S KILLER BEAVIS N BUTTHEAD GUITAR LICK ..AND IT IS A CLASSIC ROCK MAINSTAY...AND DESERVING SO...BUT OVER-ALL IN GENERAL, I DOUBT YOU WILL FIND A MORE RESPECTABLE SABBATH DISC...I STILL THINK DIO'S HEAVEN AND HELL MIGHT BE THEIR BEST...BUT THIS IS INSANE !! AND IT CAME OUT WAY WAY WAY BACK IN 71' WHEN I WAS 6!!!!!!!!!! WE ALL KNOW THAT YEAR WAS WAY OVER-LOADED WITH GREAT MUSIC ! VERY SILENTLY, THIS ALBUM CREEPS UP ON ZEP FOUR AND WHO'S NEXT AND ALL THAT OTHER STUFF...AND BITES AT THEIR ANKLES LIKE A DISEASE...I RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS ALBUM AND GET FRIENDS INTO EARLY SABBATH ! THIS IS REALLY THE MAIN BAND FROM THE 70'S YOU 'NEED' TO GET INTO....THIS IS KILLER ! --CLARK HAGINS.
