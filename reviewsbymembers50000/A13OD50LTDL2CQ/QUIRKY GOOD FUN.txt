 ...UH ...THIS IS A BIT OF A SURPRISE...THE FIRST SONG COMES HAMMERING OUT OF THE SPEAKERS WITH RECKLESS ABANDON "NEVER SAY DIE" IS A STRANGE LITTLE ALMOST PUNK LIKE ROCKER...THAT IS VERY WEIRD AND ODD FOR SABBATH...BUT YA KNOW WHAT ??? IT F***IN' ROCKS..COMPLETELY..FROM THERE..THIS ALBUM IS OK ...QUITE 'DIFFERENT" INDEED...THE GAY ASS LAMENESS OF JOHNNY BLADE IS VERY VERY FORGIVABLE INDEED AS IT TURNS OUT TO BE A SOMEHOW OK SONG AND MEMORY...AND ALITTLE AHEAD OF IT'S TIME TOO...CONSIDERING THIS ALBUM WAS FROM 1978 ! THE KEYBOARDING ON IT IS WILD ! THIS IS A 'STRUGGLING' OZZY-SABBATH ALBUM AND IT IS THEIR FINAL ALBUM WITH THE OZZSTER...THE NEXT ALBUM AFTER THIS IS ONE CALLED HEAVEN AND HELL WITH DIO AND IT WOULD PROCEED TO KICK THIS ALBUM'S ASS.........BUT I LIKE 'NEVER SAY DIE' AND THE GUYS DO MORE HERE THAN JUST HOLD IT ALL TOGETHER...SURE, IT FALLS APART ALA TECHNICAL EXTICY...BUT THE BOYS KEEP FIGHTING THE WHOLE WAY AND IN THE END THEY PATCH TOGETHER 'A GOOD ALBUM'...ITS GOT THE VERY GOOD 'AIR DANCE' AND 'JUNIOR'S EYES'...THE TOWIN' THE LINE LIKE 'HARD ROAD'....AND A STRANGE EXPERIMENTAL SONG AT THE END CALLED BREAK OUT...I REMEMBER THIS ONE...I'LL ALWAYS LIKE IT ESPECIALLY FOR 'OVER TO YOU' ...THATS A SABBATH SONG WITH SOME GREAT LYRICS...AN' YA BETTER LISTEN UP ...
