 THIS THING IS GOOD...A BIT OVER-RATED BECAUSE SOME OF THE SONGS GET LONG AND'OR DISJOINTINGLY BOTHERSOME...BUT IT'S GOT TVC15 WHICH IS A KILLER BOWIE SONG...ITS GOT OTHER GOOD SH** TOO...I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS...ITS KINDOF A BIG COMEBACK AFTER THAT DISASTER CALLED 'YOUNG AMERICANS'...ANYWAY, I DON'T THINK THIS...OR ANY OF THE BOWIE AFTER THIS WITH FRIPP AND ENO AN ET ALL IS ALL THE SLICED BREAD THAT ALL THE CRITICS WANT YOU TO BELIEVE...JUST BELIEVE ME... I KNOW BOWIE  LIKE NO ONE AND THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST OUT OF ALL THAT LATE 70'S/EARLY 80'S BOWIE...BUY THIS DISC AND YOU TOO .....SHALL AGREE
