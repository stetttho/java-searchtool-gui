 EVERYBODY SAYS THIS IS THE GREATEST BEATLES ALBUM ON EARTH...OH REALLY? IS IT REALLY BETTER THAN RUBBER SOUL AND THE WHITE ALBUM? IS IT REALLY BETTER THAN SGT. PEPPER? ...OFCOURSE IT ISN'T ! YES, ITS A FIVE STAR BEATLES CLASSIC...BUT NO...THAT DOESN'T MEAN ITS A FIVE STAR BEATLES RECORD ALONG THE LINES OF ABBEY ROAD! IT'S GOT ALOTT'A McCARTNEY JUNK ALL OVER IT ..THAT I CAN DO WITHOUT ! I AM SICK OF HEARING 'HERE,THERE, AND EVERYWHERE' ON THOSE LAME FM-LITE RADIO STATIONS...THAT GO OFF THE AIR...I HATE 'GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE'...ON THE BRIGHTSIDE...THIS ALBUM HAS THE MCCARTNEY CLASSIC 'ELENORE RIGBY'..AND ITS GOT JOHN LENNON'S AMAZING 'TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS' ON IT...ITS GOT SOME KILLER GEORGE HARRISON STUFF TOO LIKE 'I WANT TO TELL YOU'...YEAH, ITS GOOD...INFACT IT'S GREAT...BUT IS THIS OVER-RATED THING AMONG THE BEST OF THE BEATLES...NO FRICKIN WAY...ITS GOT A KILLER ALBUM COVER THOUGH...THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET FROM CHILDHOOD...THE BEST PART IS THE AMERICAN VERSION AND THE BRITISH VERSION WERE ONE AND THE SAME...I WOULD RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS ALBUM...ITS WAY BETTER THAN TODAY'S ALTERNATIVE CRAP WASTING OUR AIRWAVES AND SHARE HOLDERS DOLLARS....THIS THING MAKES RAP MUSIC LOOK LIKE WHAT IT REALLY IS ; A F***ING JOKE, MAN; BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!--- CLARK HAGINS AUGUST 24, 2005.
