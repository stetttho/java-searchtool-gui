 THE WHO HAD ALWAYS STRUGGLED IN THE STUDIO TO UPDATE THEIR LOUSY SOUND..AND HAVING FEEBLE PRODUCER KIT LAMBERT TWIDDLING THE KNOBS DIDN'T HELP AT ALL...LIVE AT LEADS PROVED THERE WAS POTENTIAL FOR THE WHO TO ROCK HARD IN THE STUDIO WITH THE BEST OF THEM...SO PETE AND THE BOYS TOOK MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND RECORDED AND MIXED THIS ONE THEMSELVES...THE SONGS ARE FOR THE MOST PART THROWN TOGETHER FROM THE ABORTED 'LIFEHOUSE' PROJECT...PETES ATTEMPT AT HIS LATEST ROCK OPERA...ONE OF THE PROBLEMS FACING LIFEHOUSE WAS THAT THE BAND AND THE AUDIENCE BOTH HAD TO SUDDENLY DISAPPEAR AT THE CONCERT AND TAKE OFF IN A UFO OR SOMETHIN'...AND THEN ROCK SAVES THE EARTH...I DONNO...IT WAS GENIOUS ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT LATER WOULD BECOME 'THE TRUMAN SHOW' OR FORREST GUMP...BUT IT ALL JUST GOT LOST AND OUT POPPED THIS; BABA O'REILLY, BARGAIN, BEHIND BLUE EYES, WON'T GET FOOLED, GOING MOBILE...ETC. ITS VERY HARD REALLY TO SAY WHAT IS BETTER; ZEP FOUR OR THIS....I MEAN IT IS REALLY CLOSE BUT FOR THE FACT ZEP FOUR CAN GET YOU LAID..BUT THIS WILL MAKE YOU THINK!.....IN 71' THE STONES PUT OUT A PRETTY GOOD ALBUM TOO CALLED STICKY FINGERS...BUT THIS WHO ALBUM EEKS OUT THE VICTORY AS BEST OF THE THREE...THE WHO DO IT ALL HERE; THEY FINALLY CAPTURE THE AGGRESSIVE WHO LIVE SOUND (EVEN THOUGH TOMMY HAS KILLER MOMENTS AND THE WHO SELL OUT HAS RAEL)...WHO'S NEXT HAS CLEAN PRODUCTION THAT THOSE ALBUMS DON'T HAVE (AND NO KIT LAMBERT THANK GOD !)...THIS WOULD PROVE TO BE THE LAST REALLY GREAT WHO ALBUM..QUADROPHENIA IS BRILLIANT BUT ITS MAINLY JUST FOR WHO PEOPLE IN GENERAL (THAT MORON FROM PEARL JAM LIKES IT TOO AND THAT HURTS ITS CRED)..THE PISS POOR MIX ON QUADROPHENIA REALLY DOES HURT THE FABULOUS MUSIC THERE...NOTHING CAN HURT WHO'S NEXT; POSSIBLY ROCK'S GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME ! --CLARK HAGINS 8-8-2005
