 THE WHOLE WHO BEING IS BEAUTIFULLY CONFUSING AND AWESOME...HERE IS A 60'S BAND THAT SMASHES THEIR GEAR WITH SMOKE BOMBS GOING OFF AND GIVING SWEARING PROFANE PUNK INTERVIEWS FILLED WITH ANGER..THEN THEY RELEASE AN ALBUM OF INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL SENSITIVE MUSIC THAT IS MELLOW ! THIS IS PROGRESSIVE ROCK ..SORTA IN THE LINE OF KING CRIMSON OR GENESIS ??? WHO THE HELL CAN FIGURE OUT THE FABULOUS WHO ?? THERE ARE MAJESTIC HARMONYS AND LIGHT HEARTED GUITAR AND PIANO ...YET THE DRUMMING IS FIERCE AND MANIAC ! THERE ARE NO NEEDLESS WEEDLY WEEDLY GUITAR SOLOS AND SCREAMS...YEAH, TOMMY DOES SOUND HALF BAKED AND "NOT FINISHED" AS ENTWISTLE WOULD LATER SAY IN INTERVIEWS..QUADROPHENIA WOULD LATER SOUND "OVER DONE" AND MONOTONOUS...THE RECORD COMPANY SCREAMED AT THE WHO TO 'JUST RELEASE THE THING!" AND THANK GOD THE WHO DID !! ITS PERFECT EXACTLY AS IT IS ; PINBALL WIZARD, CHRISTMAS, THE HAWKER,WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT , OVERTURE...NOBODY KNOWS IT..BUT THIS MIGHT ACCIDENTLY BE ROCK N ROLL'S GREATEST ALBUM EVER ! ITS EVERY STORY OF EVERY RISE AND FALL ! ITS EVERY MOVIE EVER MADE...ITS ALL ABOUT YOU AND ITS ALL ABOUT ME ! THE STRONG IS ALL ALONE AND THE VULNERABLE IS WORSHOPPED ! GET RID OF YER GREEN DAY CD AND BUY THIS..AND LEARN !
