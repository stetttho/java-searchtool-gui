 THIS IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN A BAND STOPS LISTENING TO THEIR HEART AND STARTS FOLLOWING THE MONEY TRAIL. THIS WHOLE ALBUM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH METALLICA...THE DIFFICULT DRUMMING AND COMPLICATED PASSION AND ZEAL HEARD ON 'AND JUSTICE' IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND HERE.......IN SHORT, THIS THING IS A PURE DISASTER...AND IT OPENED UP THE DOOR (WORSE EVEN STILL) FOR LAME BANDS WITH A HAIRCUT AND A RECORD DEAL TO MOVE RIGHT ON IN AND KILL THE MUSIC SCENE ...AND IN THE PROCESS DESTROY METALLICA TOO...THIS ALBUM IS AWEFUL....AT THE VERY MOST...I SAID THAT BACK IN 1991 AND I SAY IT TODAY....THERE IS NO PASSION ON IT AND EVEN SADDER...THERES NO SONGWRITING...IT'S JUST PURELY "TRYING" TOO HARD TO GET ON THE RADIO !!! AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I AM SAYING THAT ABOUT THE ONCE GREAT BAND THAT DID 'MASTER OF PUPPETS' AND ALL THAT OTHER KILLER STUFF THEY ONCE DID LONG AGO....THE PRODUCER HERE IS A CHARACTER NAMED BOB ROCK OR SOMETHIN LIKE THAT...AND THIS GUY HAS PRODUCED SOME STUFF LIKE BON JOVI I THINK.,...ANYWAY, WHY THE HELL WOULD THE GREATEST BAND ON EARTH (AT THE TIME) LISTEN TO THIS GUY....??? SURE, TODAY METALLICA ARE ALL MULTIMILLIONAIRES BUT THEIR DIGNITY IS FOREVER DESTROYED AND TAINTED AT THE LEAST AMONG REAL OLDER FANS (AND YOUNG ONES TOO!)...YOU CANNOT GO FROM 'AND JUSTICE' AN ALBUM THAT FRICKIN SOUNDS LIKE RUSH ON CRACK TO THIS !!! IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE....I WOULD RATHER SEE METALLICA BE BROKE AND PENNILESS ON WELFARE TODAY...THEN SEE THEM AS THEY ARE TODAY...THIS IS A NIGHTMARE ! I HAVE WAY WAY WAY WAY MORE RESPECT FOR AXL ROSE !!! THAT GUY NEVER NEVER NEVER SOLD OUT.....HE NEVER MADE LAME ALTERNATIVE MUSIC...INSTEAD HE GOT THE HELL OUT OF THE BUSINESS WHICH WAS THE DIGNIFIED THING TO DO!!...I GOT TONS WAY WAY WAY MORE RESPECT FOR SLAYER TOO.....TODAY, SLAYER IS NOWHERE COMPARED TO METALLICA IN THE MEDIA...AND THAT IS COOL ! SLAYER IS STILL SLAYER FROM 1988...THE SAME COOL DUDES PRETTY MUCH...I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL METALLICA IS NOW...ALL I CAN SAY IS IT IS SAD...PATHETIC...AND THIS BLACK ALBUM STARTED IT ALL...THE WORSE PART IS THERE IS NO WAY TO EVER HEAL METALLICA OR THE WOUNDS THEY HAVE OPENED IN PEOPLE'S HEARTS..AND MINDS...(NOT TO MENTION WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO THE MUSIC SCENE AND INDUSTRY STANDARDS)..PLUS THE CORPORATE WAY THEY ACT...I ONCE ASKED LARS FOR AN AUTOGRAPH AT RUSH'S 1986 'POWER WINDOWS' TOUR...TODAY, IF I SAW LARS...I WOULD WALK THE OTHER WAY
