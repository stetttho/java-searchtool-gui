 THE TERRIFYING ALBUM COVER TRICKS YOU INTO THINKING THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO HEAR A BLOODY NIGHTMARE HERE...BUT NO , ALAS, AFTER THE FRIGHTFILLED OPENING KILLER SONG CALLED SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH, THIS ALBUM SORTA MELLOWS OUT ALITTLE AND LETS SABBATH'S SONGWRITING AND ARRANGEMENT SKILLS DO THE JOB..."NATIONAL ACROBAT' IS THE SECOND SONG HERE AND IT IS A SORT-OF VOLUME FOUR LIKE SLOW ROCKER WITH GOOD STRUCTURE..THEN THERES THE REALLY BEAUTIFUL INSTRUMENTAL CALLED FLUFF...."KILLING YOURSELF TO LIVE" IS AN ANGRY LITTLE MESSAGE THAT GOES NICELY...THEN THERES THE GLOOMY FRIGHT KNOWN AS "WHO ARE YOU" A SONG THAT I LOVE PROBOBLY MORE THAN ANY OTHER SABBATH SONG AND I WOULD BLAST IT LOUD DOWN IN MY ROOM OR IN MY APARTMENT TO KEEP LAME PEOPLE AWAY (OR ?).."LOOKING FOR TODAY AND "SPIRAL ARCHITECT" ARE A COUPLE OF GOOD MOODY BLUES TYPE SABBATH ARRANGEMENTS...I REALLY LIKE 'SPIRAL' ALOT...OVER ALL, I WOULD SAY THIS ALBUM IS WHERE SABBATH DECIDES TO LET THE WORLD BE KNOWN THAT THEY ARE SERIOUS SONGWRITORS AND ARRANGERS AND THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO ALWAYS SCARE THE SH** OUT OF YOU...THIS ALBUM IS EXCELLENT BUT IT'S NOT THE CRAZY FEST THAT IS 'SABOTAGE'...THE NEXT ALBUM FROM 75' AFTER IT...THEY'RE BOTH REALLY GOOD...I HAVE FOUND IT AN ODD FOND MEMORY TO LOOK BACK AT THE CRAZY BAND KNOWN AS SABBATH ..GETTING VERY PROFESSIONAL AND ALMOST SOPHISTICATED IN THEIR APPROACH TO A COUPLE OF ALBUMS AS THEY WANTED, ON IN THEIR CARREER....THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES...I THINK ALOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE FROM TODAY NEED TO ORDER A COPY AND TELL EM' SHARK SENT YA...THIS IS GOOD STUFF ---- CLARK HAGINS.
