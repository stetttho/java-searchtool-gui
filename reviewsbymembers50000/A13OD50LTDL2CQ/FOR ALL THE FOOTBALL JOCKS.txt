 THE SAD THING IS .....I never got a chance to see this band live ! Every song is three or four chords ..we all know that...BUT WHAT IS SO DAMN WEIRD ABOUT THE RAMONES IS 'WHEN' THEY EXISTED...THEY WERE WAY BEFORE EVERYTHING...THEY WERE BEFORE THE DAMNED ..YES...ONLY THE STOOGES AND IGGY WERE BEFORE RAMONES..SO I WOULD SAY OFFICIALLY THEY ARE THE 'ORIGINAL' PUNK ROCK GROUP...I DON'T WANNA GO INTO THIS F---ING NEW YORK DOLLS ARGUMENT SO PLEASE STOP !..THE RAMONES ARE THE ORIGINAL NON-GLAMOROUS ROCKERS WHO WERE INTENTIONALLY UGLY AND CONFUSED..YET VERY STABLE IN THEIR BEING.....EVEN THOUGH I LIKE CIRCLE JERKS, BLACK FLAG AND THE DESENDENTS MORE THAN THE RAMONES, ONE HAS TO GIVE RAMONES ULTRA RESPECT...THEY WERE VERY FAST, NOT TECHNICAL AT ALL..AND THE DRUMMING WAS NOT THE GREATEST...THEY WERE SWEATY AND THESE GUYS WERE NOT 'LOOKERS'...I LOVE JOHNNY RAMONE AND HIS GUITAR FOR ALOT OF REASONS...I ALSO LIKE HIS POLITICS ! I THINK ALL THESE GUYS ARE DEAD NOW ! BUT YET THEY SEEM SO ALIVE NOW AND THEY HAVE SUCH PRESENCE....YOU DEFINITELY CAN PICK THESE GUYS UP ON EVP AND THEY ARE OUT THERE ROCKING SOMEWHERE IN THIS GALAXY ! I DON'T LIKE ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL BUT ALL THE REST IS CLASSIC....YOU DON'T WANNA BE SEDATED TRUST ME...BE ALIVE AND WELL...AND LISTEN TO RAMONES !!!!!!!!!!!!!
