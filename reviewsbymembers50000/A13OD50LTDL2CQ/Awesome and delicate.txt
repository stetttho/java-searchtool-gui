 THIS PETER GABRIEL ERA GENESIS ALBUM MIGHT BE THEIR BEST OF THAT TIME...THE LAMB IS THE BIG MOMENT ..BUT THIS QUIETLY WAS THE REAL BIG MOMENT..SATANIC AND GLOOMY YET STILL BRIGHT AND HAPPY...TONY BANKS TAKES OVER THE BAND HERE AND SIMPLY STEAMS HIS WAY ALONG SEEMINGLY NOT GIVING A F*** WHAT THE OTHERS IN THE BAND THINK...AND THANK THE GOOD LORD ! WE LEARN HERE WHY SOMETIMES THESE BIG EGO GUYS NEED TO GO FRICKIN NUTS...ITS BECAUSE THEY ARE FRICKIN' INSANE ON THEIR INSTRUMENT AND IT 'ADDS TO THE SONG AND THE 'WHOLE GROUP STUPID !"...BECAUSE OF BANKS, THIS ALBUM IS INCREDIBLE,  THEN THERES HACKET...THIS GUY COMES ALONG ON THIS ALBUM TOO..AND THIS ALBUM ABOVE ALL GENESIS ALBUMS MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT THIS BAND COULD HAVE BEEN IF THEY JUST TOOK THE TIME TO LISTEN TO THE GUY INSTEAD OF LETTING HIM LEAVE THE GROUP IN 1977...GENESIS STARTED TO SORT OF SUCK AFTER THAT ! PETER GABRIEL HERE IS ALSO AMAZING ! HIS LYRICS ARE THOUGHTFUL AND PASSIONATE...THE SONGS ARE MOODY AND SOMETIMES LONG OPUSES...THE BATTLE OF EPPING FORREST GETS WAY OUT OF HAND AND THAT IS A GOOD THING ! THE FIRST SONG HERE IS A TOMMY WHO LIKE AMAZING THING CALLED DANCING WITH THE MOONLIT KNIGHT...FIVE STARS ! BUY IT ...THIS AND A TRICK OF THE TAIL ARE ACTUALLY NECK AND NECK CONTENDERS FOR THE BEST !
