 The Circle jerks are a better band than Black Flag. This is fast, angry, well played...the drumming is brilliant and it is an album I cherish from being 15, 16, 17 back in 80', 81', 82'...Keith Morris sings here and perhaps he made the wise decision to leave Flag...Very impressive music that had a lasting impression on speed-metallers and punkers coast to coast...its way before Suicidal Tendencies ...and this quite possible is the tightest, greatest punk rock record of all time. "World up my ass" and "Red Tape'...very fast..goes by quick...makes you laugh, makes you wonder..."wasted" is better than Flag's version........the hillarious "Group Sex" is a Tubes like smash at the end ...and it is the climax...ORDER THIS TODAY !
