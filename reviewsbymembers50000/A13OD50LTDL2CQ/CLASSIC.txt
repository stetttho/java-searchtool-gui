 SUPPOSEDLY, THIS ALBUM IS 'AFTER' THE KINKS CREATIVE YEARS QUOTE UNQUOTE BUT I DON'T THINK SO ... THIS ALBUM IS PURE CLASSIC...SORTA MISUNDERSTOOD IN IT'S TIME AND APPRECIATED AT THE SAME TIME...IT GETS MORE RESPECT BY FAR THAN SAY 'THE WHO'S ITS HARD' DOES.......IT'S GOT "A ROCK N ROLL FANTASY" ..ONE OF THE BEST KINKS SONGS EVER AND OFCOURSE 'BLACK MESSIAH" A CONTROVERSIAL LITTLE DIDDY BUT WELL MEANING INDEED..I KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT WRITING THESE LITTLE TYPES OF SONGS TOO THAT PISS PEOPLE OFF AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY CAUSE THEY JUST WANNA BEAT YOU UP ANYWAY AND THEIR DUMB...ANYWAY , THE KINKS CLASSIC FATHER CHRISTMAS IS HERE...THOUGH AS I REMEMBER , I'M NOT SURE THAT IT WAS ON THE ORIGINAL ALBUM OR NOT ,,ANYWAY...THIS IS A KINKS CLASSIC..A BIT BETTER THAN 'GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT' THAT WOULD COME LATER...THOUGH IT IS PRETTY GOOD TOO..--CLARK HAGINS 8-13-05
