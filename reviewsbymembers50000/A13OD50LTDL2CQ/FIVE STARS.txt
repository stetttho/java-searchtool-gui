 A REVIEWER CAN "ONLY" GIVE 5 STARS OR MORE TO THIS GROUP...THEY ARE THE BEACH BOYS BUT ON MORE AND BETTER DRUGS........THEY CAPTURE SADNESS YET RECKLESSNESS (WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT A GUY HERE WHO KEPT DRINKIN AFTER A LIVER TRANSPLANT)...THE PAIN IN THIS GROUP IS ONLY MATCHED AND CHANNELED MAYBE BY THE SUFFERING OF THE DOORS (AND I DON'T JUST MEAN JIM)...THE HARMONYS ARE EVERYWHERE AND BRUTALLY ABUNDANT...THE MAMAS AND PAPAS DECLARE THEY ARE THE BEST NOT WITH THE BRASHNESS OF THE ROLLING STONES BUT WITH SUBTLETY...ALL THESE SONGS ARE GREAT...THESE ARE POPULAR PEOPLE YET THEY DREAM AND WANT TO BE NERDS THEY CAN NEVER BE....AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER GROUP LIKE THIS !
