 QUEEN REALLY IS THE GREATEST ROCK N ROLL BAND EVER AND I KNOW I SAY THAT ABOUT EVERYBODY BECAUSE TO ME , ROCK IS ONE BIG HAPPY BAND...BUT QUEEN STANDS OUT ...THIS WAS QUEEN'S FOURTH RELEASE AND 'DEATH ON TWO LEGS' HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST HYMNS I HAVE EVER HEARD...I LIKE IT EXPECIALLY BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE COME UP TO ME ANGRILY AND TOLD ME ITS ABOUT ME! OH HOW THEY JUST DON'T KNOW !...ANYWAY , 39' IS A CLASSIC LITTLE BRIAN MAY SONG AND I'M IN LOVE WITH MY CAR IS AWESOME THOUGH IT TRIES TOO HARD...THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS A ROCK OPERA HOOKED TOGETHER TIGHTLY..IT ALL COMES TO AN END WITH BOHEMIEN...WELL IT SHOULD,...OBVIOUSLY, THE QUEENS HAVE SPENT MANY A YEAR LISTENING TO THE WHO'S TOMMY AND A QUICK ONE...AND LOTS OF BEATLES AND BEE GEES...THESE GUYS CAN BOTTLE MELODY LIKE NO BAND ! QUEEN CAPTURE AN ALMOST PSYCHEDELIC AMBIANCE AND THEN THEY ROCK VERY HARD TOO! THIS IS A VERY BIZARRE BAND INDEED...EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE BAND ! BUY IT AND GET ANOTHER TO ORDER IT AND LISTEN TO THESE GUYS AND LEARN...START YOUR OWN BAND...AND DON'T BE A LAME ALTERNATIVE ROCK BAND THAT SOUNDS TYPICAL AND LAME LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE; BE UNIQUE ! BE AN INDIVIDULE ! BE QUEEN !
