 IS THIS THE GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME ? NO. I DON'T EVEN THINK ITS AS GOOD AS BOSTON...BUT THIS THING IS F----ING GOOD INDEED !! DIAMOND DAVE RULES OVER THIS EPIC FIRST VAN HALEN RECORD......SURE, EDDIE IS A GOD, BUT DAVE REALLY IS THE SHOW ! THE WHOLE MATRIX OF VAN HALEN WITH SAMMY HAGAR JUST LOOKS RIDICULOUS EVEN MORE WHEN CONSIDERING THIS HERE ALBUM...AND BELIEVE ME, THE IDEA OF THIS BAND WITHOUT DAVE STILL SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TODAY ! I STILL WONDER IF MAYBE IN 1984 I DIED...AND THIS HERE WE ARE ALL LIVING IN IS HELL BECAUSE NO WAY SHOULD/COULD VAN HALEN REALLY BE CARRYING ON WITHOUT DAVE...I CAN SORTA SEE GENESIS WITHOUT PETE...BUT VAN HALEN WITHOUT DAVE I JUST DON'T GET...AND I CAN BARELY EVEN IMAGINE YOUTH AND 'LIFE' ITSELF WITHOUT DAVE........DAVE 'IS' DEFINITELY GOD ..OR MAYBE HE IS JESUS CHRIST...AND WE ALL JUST DIDN'T 'GET' THE SECOND COMING THAT CAME AND WENT...AND NOW IT LOOKS AS IF WE ALL HAVE COME IN LAST AND OUT OF KURT'S CLOSET...ANYWAY...THIS ALBUM IS AWESOME...ITS BETTER THAN WHOS NEXT, ZEP FOUR, TATTOO YOU, SOME GIRLS, RUBBER SOUL, AND PET SOUNDS..ZIGGY STARDUST...MOVING PICTURES BY RUSH......BUT IT STILL AIN'T THE BEST BUT GODDAMN IT, I LOVE DIAMOND DAVE...FORGET EDDIE AND HIS HUMORLESS EGO ..THOUGH HIS GUITAR REALLY IS GREAT.........BUY THIS ALBUM FOR DAVE ! --CLARK HAGINS  ; 5 STARS !!!
