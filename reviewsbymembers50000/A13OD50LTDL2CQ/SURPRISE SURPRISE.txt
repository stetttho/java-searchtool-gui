 AFTER THE ENORMOUS SUCCESS OF 2112, ONE WOULD THINK RUSH WOULD HAPPILY COUNT THEIR MONEY AND GO ON A LONG VACATION...BUT NO, RUSH CAME BACK WITH NOT JUST A NEW ROCK OPERA..THEY HAD A WHOLE NEW SOUND ! NEIL PEART SOUNDS BETTER THAN EVER AND GEDDY'S BASS GETS MORE CLEVER SOMEHOW...RUSH DECIDE TO DIG INTO SOME CLASSIC NUGGETS HERE; THE BEST OFCOURSE IS THE INSANE CYGNUS STORY BEGINS...WHATS REALLY WEIRD IS HOW THIS IS ALL NOTHING REALLY LIKE 2112 (EVEN BACK THEN!) ..THE EVOLUTION OF RUSH IS REMARKABLE...THE UNDERRATED ALEX LIFESON ACTUALLY TAKES FULL CHARGE OF THIS ALBUM AND HE LETS IT BE KNOWN ..FOR NOW, THIS IS MY BAND ! THE VERY FIRST SONG STARTS WITH A TENDER ACCOUSTIC BIT BEFORE THE SONG GETS LOUD YET NICELY DONE AND MELODIC.."A FAREWELL TO KINGS" GIVES WAY TO THE MAJESTIC XANADU..A RUSH LIVE STAPLE AND ONE OF ROCK'S BEST LONG SONGS, FILLED WITH TECHNICAL PROGGY HEAVY AND LIGHT PARTS AND DELIVERED WITH EMOTION...YES, A FAREWLL TO KINGS IS BIZARRELY EVEN BETTER THAN 2112..BUT HERES THE KICKER ! YOU AIN'T HEARD NOTHIN YET...RUSH ONLY KEEPS ON GETTING BETTER FROM HERE ! I'VE SEEN THEM IN CONCERT NEARLY 20 TIMES FOR A REASON ! RUSH IS NOT JUST ROCK ENTERTAINMENT...RUSH IS LIKE HOMEWORK...YOU HAVE TO DO IT AND GET GOOD GRADES...RUSH WILL HELP YOU SUCCEED IN LIFE ! THEY INSPIRE YOU LIKE RELIGION AND YOU HUNGER FOR MORE...THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL BAND ON THE PLANET !
