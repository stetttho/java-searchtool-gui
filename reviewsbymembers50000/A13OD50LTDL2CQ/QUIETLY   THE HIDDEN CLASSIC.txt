 PET SOUNDS IS THE BEACH BOYS REALLY GOOD YET SOMEHOW MODEST NIRVANA ALBUM THAT TRIES TO JUST SIT THERE AND BE SWEPT UNDER THE RUG AS THE CRITICS JUMP UP AND DOWN AND SCREAM.."LOOK AT IT ! ..LOOK AT THIS !!!..AIN'T IT THE DANDIEST !!!...BUT SURFS UP REALLY IS 'THE ALBUM' FOR THOSE WHO REALLY KNOW THE BEACH BOYS AND GREW UP WITH THEIR ALBUMS AND CULTURE LAYING AROUND THE HOUSE AS YER SISTER'S INSCENTS BURNED IN THE ROOM IN THE DISTANCE.."LOOKING AT TOMORROW...A WELFARE SONG" ...MAN THIS STUFF IS SAD...AND SOME OF IT AIN'T EVEN BRIAN WILSON STUFF..WHATS REALLY GOOD ABOUT IT IS HOW..IT "ISN'T GOOD".."STUDENT DEMONSTRATION TIME" IS AWEFUL AND YET YOU LISTEN TO IT AND ALL THESE OTHER SONGS THAT TRY TO BE A STATEMENT..(AND THIS ALBUM 'TRIED' INTENTIONALLY TO BE GOOD AND AHEAD OF IT'S TIME IN IT'S DAY...AND IT FAILED !)...STILL, ALL IN ALL IS ALL WE ARE...SO I WILL SAY, I SOMEHOW LIKE THIS THING AS MUCH IF NOT MORE THAN PET SOUNDS..IF NOT FOR DISNEY GIRLS (1957) ..AND THE KILLER "TIL I DIE"..PEOPLE..THIS THING IS A CLASSIC ! YOU SHOULD NOT OVERLOOK THIS HIDDEN GEM !  One note; The long Opera at the end "Surfs Up" is Brian Wilson at His all time greatest peak and nobody knows it..it is said he wrote thousands of songs and demo bits that he never bothered to record ...that just slipped away...that is sad people..IF ANY OF YOU OUT THERE 'EVER' WRITE A SONG YOU THINK IS EVEN HALFWAY GOOD..I RECOMMEND YOU GO RECORD IT ..BEFORE YOU FORGET IT....TRY TO BE THE GREATEST...AND DON'T LISTEN TO ANY INDUSTRY HACK...START YOUR OWN RECORD COMPANY IF YOU HAVE TO...I WISH THAT BRIAN WISLON WOULD HAVE ..BACK IN 71'..WE ALL MIGHT BE MUCH BETTER FOR IT TODAY ..IF HE DID
