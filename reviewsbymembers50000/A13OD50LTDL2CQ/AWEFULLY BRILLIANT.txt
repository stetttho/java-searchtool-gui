 THIS BAND IS SO CHEESEY AND THEIR HIGH PITCHED SQUEALING LEAD SINGER IS SO ANNOYING (IN THE SAME REALM OF GEDDY LEE OF RUSH) THAT THEY ARE ARTISTICLY ONE OF THE GREATEST FM RADIO ROCKERS OF ALL TIME...AS BOTHERSOME AS STYX OR RECENT YES...THAT YOU CAN'T TURN EM' OFF..WHEN I HEAR 'I'M GONNA KEEP ON LOVIN' YOU' ON THE RADIO, I AM SUDDENLY MEZMERIZED FOR A MOMENT AS IF I AM LISTENING TO MAYBE BARRY GIBB AND THE BEE GEES.....THIS WHOLE BAND IS INCREDIBLE ! AND THEY HAVE ALOT OF NERVE TO SUCK THIS HARD AND YET STILL BE AMONG THE GREATEST ...SORTA LIKE BOSTON...BUT NOT THAT GOOD !...I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY THIS THING TOO..AND LISTEN..JUST FOR THE SONGWRITOR CRAFT HERE ! THESE GUYS CAN ARRANGE SONGS LIKE NO BAND !!!!!!!!! IF YOU WANT RADIO HIT SONGS...WELL HERE IT IS ! SONGWRITING 101..BUT DONE WELL AND DONE RIGHT !!! THESE GUYS ARE AWESOME AND FIVE STARS THEY GET AND DESERVE !!....and to think ! this here album came after years and years of struggle for this band ! They kept on goin..and they deserved all the fame and money they got...from the hard work and never quit attitude..GOD BLESS REO !
