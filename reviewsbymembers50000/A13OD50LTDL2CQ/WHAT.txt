 THIS 1972 GENESIS ALBUM IS NESTLED NEATLY BETWEEN NURSERY CRIME AND SELLING ENGLAND AND IT IS A CLASSIC ! VERY MELODIC AND ATMOSPHERIC, IT IS GENESIS GETTING TIGHTER AND MORE AMBITIOUS BEYOND THE VERY AMBITIOUS NURSERY CRIME INDEED...PETER GABRIEL IS SUDDENLY 'THE GUY' BUT THE WHOLE BAND IS YET 'THE BAND'...AS PROVED IN 'WATCHERS OF THE SKYS" THE FUNKY PROGGY BEAT LAIDEN OPENER WHICH BUILDS FROM SILENCE INTO POWER...A THING RUSH TOOK NOTE OF AND WOULD IMPLEMENT INTO THEIR SONGS KINDOF...THE DAVID BOWIE TYPE 'LEADER' QUALITY OF GABRIEL IS REALLY EVIDENT THOUGH ON THIS ALBUM AND SUPPERS READY IS THE DEFINITIVE GABRIEL STANCE...I LOVE THIS ALBUM ...EVEN MORE THAN OTHERS YET I STILL HAVE TO KEEP IT BELOW SELLING ENGLAND AND THE LAMB IN THE NAME OF WHAT LITTLE CONSISTANCY I HAVE IN MY QUEST FOR ETERNAL FUN CONTRIDICTION...I LOVE GENESIS...I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS EARLY STUFF ! GREAT TO LISTEN TO ON THE CD PLAYER IN THE CAR WHILE STUCK IN TRAFFIC OR WHILE SITTING IN A JACUZZI OR HOT BATH...MEZMORIZING,,VERY ENJOYABLY ONE OF THE BEST BANDS OF ALL TIME..UNTIL THAT JERK PHIL COLLINS GRABBED THE HELM !
