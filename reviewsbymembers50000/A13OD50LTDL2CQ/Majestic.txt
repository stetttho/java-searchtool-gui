 THIS Album is just so grand....Rock/Pop music mixed with classical music orchestration....While the Who were goofing off with 'who sell out' and the Stones were stumbling with 'Satanic majestys", this moodys band was doing THIS !!!The 'big songs' are there but they aren't necessarily holding it all together the way the "Pinbal Wizard" saves Tommy...There are gay little connector songs that alot of people from today are gonna hate,,..and all the orchestration will get on the nerves too ...as people will kindly allow it with Metallica though ....but maybe not here...THIS ALBUM IS FOR OLDER PEOPLE --AND IT REALLY IS for People probobly 'from' the 60's ..though somehow I ended up getting into it..one day back in the early 80's along with punk rock and other stuff..."Nights in White Satin" the 7 minute and 24 second classic is here ! ..but there is also this "Tuesday Afternoon " song that ain't have bad either ...I really like this album...ITS GONNA BE A REALLY REALLY TOUGH SELL TO TODAY'S KIDS INTO KORN AND TOOL and all that other stuff...But I wish especially young people would give this a chance and somehow get into this...teachers should tell the kids about this great album..and this GREAT MOMENT IN ROCK HISTORY...THE WHOLE ALBUM...I DON'T JUST MEAN GET INTO TWO SONGS...because this thing really does tell an important story too---THE DAY BEGINS...THEN THE DAY TRAVELS ON INTO LUNCH AND DINNER ETC...ITS A LITTLE DAY IN YOUR LIFE...All of our lives...its a memory to cherish....FOREVER ........
