 ALOT OF PEOPLE THINK PARANOID AND MASTERS ARE THE SH*** BUT REALLY THIS FIRST SABBATH ALBUM AIN'T BAD AT ALL...IT'S GOT THE WIZARD WHICH IS A SONG THAT ROCKS OUT FOR YOUNG DRUMMERS AND GUITARISTS EVERYWHERE TO JAM ON TO TIGHTEN THEIR EARLY CHOPS WITH...IN 84, THE 19 YEAR OLD ME WOULD PLAY IT ALOT..ON BOTH INSTRUMENTS...THE FRIGHTENING COVER AND THE SPOOKY OPENING SONG HAS TO GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES IF YOU BELIEVE IN JESUS AS I DO ! THIS IS SATAN , PEOPLE...! PACKAGED AND PUT ON A DISC TO SCARE THE LIVING SH** OUTTA YOU...IT'S GOT NIB (SOME OF MY FRIENDS USED TO SAY THAT STOOD FOR NUNS IN BONDAGE)...BUT I DON'T THINK IT DID...ANYWAY, THIS IS A GREAT SABBATH ALBUM...I WOULD SAY IT IS THE BEST BUT PARANOID AND THE DIO LED 'HEAVEN AND HELL' ARE RIGHT THERE WITH IT...THIS IS A CLASSIC THOUGH...FIVE STARS; BUY THIS NOW !!!!
