 NO NO NO NO BAND CAN TOUCH PRIEST ! THE SONGS ARE CATCHY...SPED UP AC DC BUT WITH WAY BETTER GUITARS...THE DRUMS AIN'T THE GREATEST BUT OVER ALL PACKAGEWISE...THERE IS NO BAND THAT CAN PACK THE MELODY AND HEAVY WALLOP TOGETHER LIKE PRIEST...THINK OF CREDENCE CLEAR WATER ON 45 MEETS SLAYER NOW SLOW IT DOWN A BIT AND PUT THE MOST INSANE HIGH PITCHED SINGER EVER SCREAMING OVER IT....FOR VENGEANCE ! AWESOME ; BUY THIS !!
