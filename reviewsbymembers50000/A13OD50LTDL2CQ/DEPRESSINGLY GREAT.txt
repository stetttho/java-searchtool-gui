 PICTURE PINK FLOYD IF THEY WERE A GARAGE BAND FROM THE 80'S AND IF THEY REALLY SUCKED...NOW GIVE THEM A LITTLE TALENT, TEMPO, AND SONGWRITING AND YOU WOULD HAVE A PRETTY KILLER BAND CALLED THE CURE......EVERY SONG HERE IS A CLASSIC AND IT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF REALLY LAME CHICKS WITH THEIR NOSES IN THE AIR BACK IN THE 80'S....YEAH , ROBERT SMITH IS A DRAG AND HIS BRITISH DEPRESSION GETS BORING FAST...BUT STILL YOU LISTEN AND YOU ENJOY THE CURE...'BOYS DON'T CRY' KICKS THINGS OFF AND IT ONLY GOES UPHILL FROM THERE...ITS ALL GOOD HERE, THOUGH I LIKE PUNK BANDS MORE AND I THINK SABBATH DEFINES DEPRESSION BETTER...I STILL LIKE THE CURE THOUGH ...AND FOR ALL YOU LAME CHICKS IN THE 80S...WELL, I HOPE YER ON WELLFARE.....--CLARK HAGINS.
