 COULD 'SOME GIRLS' BE THE BEST STONES ALBUM? MANY PEOPLE THINK SO....BEFORE THIS ALBUM, THE STONES HAD THEIR PERIOD OF ROUGH TIMES IN THE STUDIO...BLACK AND BLUE WAS OK AND SO WAS GOATS HEAD AND ITS ONLY ROCK N ROLL..BUT THE STONES WERE A BIT CONFUSED AND IT SHOWED ..THEN THEY DID THIS !!!!!!! THIS IS THE CLASSIC WITH TONS OF HIT SONGS AND FIERCE BLUESY FEEL NOT REALLY HEARD SINCE LET IT BLEED...THE GUITARS HERE RE-WRITE THE ROCK N ROLL BOOK INSTANTLY...AND WHERE THE STONES GOT THIS ALBUM OUT OF THEIR HEADS IS UNFATHOMABLE AT THE VERY LEAST...THERE IS NO BETTER FEELING THAN BEING VERY DRUNK AT THREE IN THE MORNING AND JUST SITTIN THERE IN A DAZE AS SOME GIRLS KEEPS PLAYIN ROUND N ROUND WITH YOU ALL ALONE THERE ON THE COUCH AS THE TV QUIETLY BURNS THE WHITE NOISE...I DON'T DRINK ANYMORE BUT MY MEMORIES OF SOME GIRLS ARE GREAT....THIS ALBUM CAN GET YOU LAID TOO ALA LED ZEP FOUR........THIS THING IS PURE DYNOMITE; AWESOME,...AND I'M NOT WRITING THIS BECAUSE SPICOLI WOULD BE PROUD...I'M WRITING THIS BECAUSE THE ROLLING STONES MAY HAVE IN THEIR FINAL YEARS OF RECORDING RELEVENCY, PUT OUR ROCK'S GREATEST SOLID 'GOOD RECORD'...BETTER THAN THE WHO...JUST ORDER THIS TODAY ! MICK AND KIETH PROVED HERE...WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN..DON'T BET AGAINST THEM ...THEY ARE GODS.
