 In my opinion, this is the best album they did...Working man is really good though ...and though I am a Dead newby with only 23 shows under my belt...I feel qualified to review the Dead and I feel my review may be the only one you will need since I mainly got into the dead because of Greg Ginn. I'll never forget Anaheim with Dylan and all the Long Beach Arena shows and whatnot...oh how I got drunk and danced to those shows...Lots of happy guys n gals hugging and though I had no gal , I had my Dead...this album has it all; Box of Rain, Friend of the Devil, etc...ITS A CLASSIC , I'm sick of Truckin...but everytime I hear it, I listen nonetheless..Attics of my life ..a beautful song and ofcourse there is the awesome Sugar Magnolia,...I am one of the rare people who thinks Dead studio albums are all really good...and I don't mean "in the Dark'....The shows at the Forum were awesome...I got close enough to almost grab the drums sticks and rock with Mickey Hart ...but I just didn't quite have the courage...nor the talent ; BUY THIS ALBUM...AND TELL A FRIEND...AND CHECK OUT THEIR STUFF ON PBS RIGHT NOW TOO...SHOWS FROM WINTERLAND IN THE 70'S...ITS EXCELLENT. --CLARK HAGINS.
