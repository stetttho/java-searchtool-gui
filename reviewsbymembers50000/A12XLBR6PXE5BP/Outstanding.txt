 I was rather skeptical when I first heard of this book. After all, explaining C++ in anything less than 500 or 600 pages seemed impossible. I was very pleasantly surprised when I started reading  though. This is very down-to-earth and crystal-clear reading. Easy to  understand and, most importantly, you won't get overwhelmed by the sheer  size of the mountain ahead of you. Naturally, you can't expect this book to  turn you into a C++ guru. But that isn't its purpose. (Besides, there are  *no* books that will turn you into a guru, only books that are more  complete, including Stan's own C++ Primer.) This book is excellent for  *learning* C++ and getting off the ground. It achieves this goal better  than any other C++ book I've read. Once you've read this book, you can  graduate to more advanced material, such as the C++ Primer (which is  didactically very good) or Stroustrup's book (which is didactically nowhere  near as good, but works better as a reference due to its terseness).  "Essential C++" provides very solid C++ grounding without  neglecting any of the important parts of the language. Highly  recommended!
