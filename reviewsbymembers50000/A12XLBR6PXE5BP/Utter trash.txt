 This book is at approximately the maturity level of a 13 year old. No characterization whatsoever, a story line that has no credibility at all, dialogue that makes a Superman comic book look like literature by comparison, and complete lack of internal logic. Unbelievably poor, puerile, and chauvinistic; not even acceptable as light airplane reading. I rank this book as the worst I've read in several years, even making very large concessions to the fact that it is meant to be escapist entertainment. Forget it.
