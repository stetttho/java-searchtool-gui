 I just received the book and ended up reading it in a single sitting. Outstanding! This book is is a veritable treasure trove of tips, tricks, gotchas, and very solid design advice. You need to know C++ fairly well to  follow all the subtleties but if you meet this prerequisite, you will find  yourself referring to this book time and time again. The sections on  exception safety are particularly valuable. Highly recommended!
