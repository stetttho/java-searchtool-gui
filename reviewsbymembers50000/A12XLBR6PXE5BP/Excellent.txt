 I started reading this book over dinner, couldn't put it down, and ended up finishing it that night. Britcher presents a perspective on computing that is refreshingly different from the usual technocratic point of view.  It is nice to see someone who worries about the ethics of this industry for  a change, and who doesn't subscribe to the idea that if something is  computerized, it must automatically be better. Lot's of thoughtful comments  about the state of the industry, software engineering, management, and the  psychology and ethics of computing. Highly recommended!
