 This is a great companion to Musser & Saini. I particularly enjoyed the in-depth explanations of the motivation for why things are the way they are. Instead of simply explaining how to use the STL, Austern explains how  and why it works. This becomes particularly important if you want to extend  the STL with algorithms or containers of your own because Austern shows how  to it correctly, so that things will *really* work. The language and  explanations in the book are clear, precise, and to the point. An excellent  companion to Musser & Saini.
