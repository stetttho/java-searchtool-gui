 On my second reading, I'm still finding more gems in this book. Up to now, it was almost impossible to find any comprehensive material on the standard library. All one could find was the odd article about some aspect of the  library, or rather specialized books about STL. Nicolai has fixed that  particular problem once and for all. The book reminds of Richard  Stevens's famous UNIX books. Incredibly complete, incredibly detailed,  incredibly accurate, and a great tutorial and reference at the same time.  And, best of all, it's just as accessible to someone who is not a real  expert as it is for someone who's been using C++ for years. This is one  of the *very* few books that get a spot on my top shelf. A classic that I  will come back to again and again.
