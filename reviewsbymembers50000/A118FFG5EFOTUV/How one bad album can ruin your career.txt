 Chante Moore was one of the female artist who stood out in the weakest crop of R&B artist in the last decade. Three solid albums, Precious, A Love Supreme, and This Moment Is Mine, made her a household name. Her songs were about real love, never relied on man bashing, and had a feel good vibe to it. Then we got this crap, as if to say the hell with all of us. The material on Exposed, is reserved for artist like Monica and Mary J Blige, but Mary J has moved moved on from that sort of thing. I know as an artist you want to grow and do new things, she could of reached out to the jazz and adult contemporary crowds where her music could of blossomed or tried to flex her muscles in the neo soul arena, but like Toni Braxton she messed around with the bling bling hip hop arena and paid for it dearly! Soon Tamia will sitting on the bench with these two if she keeps it up.  Chante hasn't recovered after Exposed, for her next solo joint she's going to have to dig real deep and look back on why the fans loved her in the first place.
