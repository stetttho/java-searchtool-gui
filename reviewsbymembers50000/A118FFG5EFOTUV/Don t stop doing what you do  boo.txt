 I admit, I only bought her first album because she was fine as hell. Then I listened to "Come Away With Me", and was blown away. What even impressed me more is how well she adapts to different genre's of music from jazz to blues, blues to country, country to dare I say a mini duet with Andre 3000 of Outkast, and all came off not good, but damn good. She's a breath of fresh air in an industry full of blonde bimbo's, gangbangers, pimps, drug dealers, suburban whites acting black, etc.   Now on to this gem. Seems she went more folk and country this go around, which doesn't disappoint. Look, I don't listen to neither, I'm more of a jazz, old school r&b, neo soul guy, and I have to say Norah came of well, I loved the duet with Dolly Parton. Her trademark stuff still stands out, like "Sunrise" and my favorite track "Above Ground". Is it better that the first, you decide, I say both are even, which isn't a bad thing.   My advice to Norah as devoted fan to music is to keep doing what you do best, your fans love you for who you are. Please don't sell out to the mainstream, like other artists, who build a solid fan base, and stab them in the back for pop star royalty.
