 Oh boy, this PPV is the first of many trainwreck PPV's in the WWE this year. Brock vs. Big Show (winner gets spot in Royal Rumble)(**1/2) Not a bad match, problem though, this one here should of been the main event for the Smackdown telecast leading up to the PPV, instead of it being on the PPV. There we would of had time for say a WWE Tag Title Match or maybe Women's Title match, or say a Cruiserweight Title Match. Storm & Regal vs. The Dudley Boyz (***) Not a great match, but a good match. Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie (-*****) How do you follow up a lame attempt at softcore porn featuring these two. Put them in a crappy match. Dawn has been so misused in the WWE. She's a vixen, who's suppose to be managing. Instead she's involved in the second worst stoyline in 2002 (Katie Vick was #1), and was in the worst match of the year, until..... Triple H vs. Scott Steiner (-*****) This bad boy here. I felt bad for H, he's no where near what he was in 2000 and early 2001, but he's not at fault here. The man was wrestling himself for crying out loud, and if you pay attention, you can see him bitching at Steiner. Steiner did the same move for about five minutes. This should be the worst match of 2003, but later we were treated with the epic Albert vs. Stephanie Match on Smackdown in the summer. Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit (*****) Best match of 2003, but it wouldn't of hurt to have Chris go over here and at least drop it at No Way Out. Royal Rumble (***1/2) I loved the beginning, how Jericho eliminated Shawn Michaels early. That's classic and will go up there in Royal Rumble folklure. All the workers did a great job early on, but it went south after Jericho was eliminated, and picked back up when Lesner came in and eventually won it. Taker returned at #30. Wasn't all around bad, but please to avoid self torture, it would be wise to skip the Dawn/Torrie match and the classic Steiner/Triple H match as well. Benoit and Angle saved and made the PPV.
