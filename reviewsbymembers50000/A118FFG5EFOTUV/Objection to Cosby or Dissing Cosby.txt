 I would say "the man" sent out Dyson to go after Cosby, after Cosby's speech last year, because you know everytime my community, the black community,says even one word that will make a difference, here comes someone to try to shut him/her up. That kind of thinking would make me no different than the line of thinking in this book.  First off let me say this, Dyson is a well spoken brother and what he says isn't garbage at all. I have problems with his approach, but there are things he says I do agree with.  Main problem with this book I have, is the fact Dyson doesn't offer anything different to counter Cosby's criticisms. No one in the community will argue the role the government, corporations, and others have played that have led to the conditions many brothers and sisters find themselves in. That wasn't what Cosby was talking about, Cosby was talking more on how the community as a whole has failed and put us in a deep hole. He blamed the entire community young and old, rich and poor, male and female, light skin and dark skin.  Page for page Dyson took jabs at Cosby, for at I could sense dodging his "blackness", or not stepping up and being some "bold" figure he thinks he could of been. While some could be debated, that was Cosby's business, and these jabs take alot away from what Cosby was talking about. Speaking of which Dyson has made some low blow comments on HBCU's and black churches that wasn't nice and somewhat disturbing. Compare that to what Cosby has done outside the community, and almost makes me feel foolish for giving this book the time of day.  I don't want to get to bashing Dyson. This book was suppose to take Cosby to task, but after reading it, I agree even more with Cosby. Sad thing is, I feel both Dyson and Cosby are on the same page, but as I've seen in my community so many times, people refuse to put aside their differences, come to some common ground, and help move our community forward.
