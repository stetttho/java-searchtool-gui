 What do I mean by band? For those living in caves, hopefully you know that Sade is a band, that bares the lead singers first name.  Stronger Than Pride, went a different route than the band's previous two albums, "Diamond Life" and "Promise". The first two were more melancholy, the mood here was subliminaly psycho happy to drunk depressing, I never recommend Sade albums for those down on their luck. This one is an insane downer, keep this album from those who are chemically unbalanced.  Musically, this was about as strong as "Promise", lyrics were okayish, not the greatest of all the Sade albums, but better than alot of stuff I've heard past and present. Favorite Tracks include the rare upbeat "To Turn My Back On You", "Paradise", the depressing "Love Is Stronger Than Pride", and the so depressing that you hit the bottle "Clean Heart". The track the outshines them all is the final track and one of my top ten Sade tracks "Siempre Hay Esperanza", Sade is not singing here, but the rest of the band cuts loose. If I was to make my own Sade CD, this track would definately be on there.  If you are a Sade fan and don't have this album in your collection, I would advise you to pick this one up. It very well may be the weaker of all Sade albums, but it's very solid and stands on its own, compared to the others, "Siempre Hay Esperanza" alone is enough to pick this album up.
