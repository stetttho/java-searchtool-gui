 What makes the album bearable? Tamia's lovely vocals, her ability to belt out a track is a thing of beauty. She is no doubt my favorite singer right now.   Why is this album bad? The production. The over producing or lack there of, take your pick, really brought Tamia down. Only two songs stand out, "Stranger In My House", which isn't all that great and the remake "Love Me In A Special Way", which makes every other song on this album sound elementary.  Maybe it was high hopes, after all, I loved her self titled debut, and been in love with her since "You Put A Move On My Heart" dropped in '95. "Nu Day", is a definate pass.
