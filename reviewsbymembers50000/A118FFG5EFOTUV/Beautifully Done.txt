  She returns after a four year hiatus. First thing I like about this album, is that it clearly sounds from the first, without Jill abandoning what brought her to the dance. The album doesn't sound like an extension of her debut, so thumbs up for that.   Second thing, the direction of the album is all spiritually positive and upbeat for the most part. Not to say her debut wasn't, but the second seemed to steer away from the drama of a say "Slowly Surely" and in its place is a "Spring Summer Feeling". It comes off well and doesn't do what so many sophmore albums have done and sound like an extension of the first.   Last, I noticed Jill is more preachy here. No subliminal message or breaking down verses here, Jill is bold and to the point on tracks like "Rasool" and The Fact Is (I Need You), my favorite track. I heard songs like these a million times and 90% of them suck, what makes Jill different from the others is her delivery, not so much in style, but a Mercedes versus your other luxury car kind of delivery. You actually want to hear her sing it.   Please people, don't sleep on this gem. With all the crap polluting the airwaves and TV, we need more artist like Jill Scott not only to bring something refreshing, but to remind us why we are all fans of music period.
