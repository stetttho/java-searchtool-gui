 In what has been a down year in the WWE, this was the best PPV of the year, IMO.  This was of course the first Smackdown PPV. The build up for the matches was subpar at best, with only the Vince/Gowen match being the strongest, one I could of gave a damn about. The PPV also followed Raw's "Bad Blood", which was close to being godawful. I gave it a chance, and afterwards was quite suprised. Match by Match Benoit vs. Guerrero (****) Solid opening match, marred by Rhyno's anticipated turn on Benoit. Right person went over, finish should have been clean. Noble vs. Gunn (**) Never intrested in anything Gunn is involved in, but this was quite entertaining. Better for SD telecast instead of a PPV! Bar Room Brawl Was quite entertaining if anything else. Haas & Benjiman vs. Misterio & Kidman (****) Slow start, but match flowed nicely with a clean finish and the right team going over. Haas & Benjiman really gelled as a team in 2K3. Undertaker vs. Cena (***1/2) Taker was in rare form here, which really helped. Cena was money from the get go, rap promo was nasty as hell. Finish was dubbed from Taker's match with Triple H from WM X-7 in 2001. Sable vs. Stephanie (-***) Bore fest, awful, and Albert. Trish/Victoria this wasn't! Vince vs. Zach Gowen (*) Effort from Zach was there, on Smackdown this would be great TV and I would have been nicer. However on a PPV, I'm not intrested in watching a handicap carry a roided, stiff, crippled owner for an excess of 20 plus minutes, where you could of teamed Matt Hardy & Rhyno up to face Tajiri & say Sean O'Haire. Same could be said for the Sable/Steph match, but there at least you have a segment of the audience happy to see two hot chicks roll around for 3-5 minutes, where he we have a match majority never cared about, but jammed down are throats, and the payoff was lackluster at best. Angle vs. Lesner vs. Show (****) Solid match and the fact it was mainly Lesner and Angle, with little Show made it a quality match.  This PPV broke a string of mediocre PPV, but SummerSlam picked up where Bad Blood left off sadly. This should be a blue print though, on how you balance wrestling and sports entertainment.
