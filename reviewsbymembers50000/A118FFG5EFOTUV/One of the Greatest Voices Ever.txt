 Maybe it's Mariah's high pitches that draws those comparisons, but I agree, there is no comparing Riperton and Mariah.  Few things I vaguely remember as a young child, one of them is hearing, the hook to Riperton's "Loving You"! I was very very young when she died, and though I only heard very little of her material afterwards, but hearing what little I heard, I felt had she lived, she would of made a huge impact in the world of R&B. Riperton has one of the best voices ever, and I am a music junkie, she's up there with Patti LaBelle, Mahalia Jackson, Etta James, to name a few. And I think the guys at VH-1 are on crack naming her a one hit wonder, but then VH-1 has really fallen of as of late.  It was hearing various remakes of "Inside My Love", that made finally get up and search for any Minnie Riperton CD, my search led me to this one. "Inside My Love" is my favorite Riperton track of all, with the duet w/ Jose Felincio (sp), "Light My Fire", in a close second.  I reccomend anyone into good music, quality music to pick up this CD or any Riperton CD out there. As I said before, she is one of the greatest vocalist ever.
