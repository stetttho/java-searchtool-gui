 Simply put it, Chante wanted to go mainstream and put togetther this car wreck of a CD, and got some okay results. That inspired her to follow up with that crappy CD "Exposed", in which her career has yet to recover from. But enough with that.  The okay results, were the first two released tracks, "Chante's Got A Man" and "I See You In A Different Light" (duet with JoJo Hailey). These two tracks are definately different from her previous work, and yes they come off well, especially the duet with JoJo. She got a nice buzz from that. But neither track did nothing to help this album stand out or side by side with "Precious" and "A Love Supreme".  The experiment goes wrong with the tracks laced by Jerkins and Dupri., especially the Jerkins produced "If A Gave Love", which starts off sounding like Brandy & Monica's, "The Boy Is Mine" and then rips off Jennifer Lopez's "If You Had My Love", (now I heard of beat jacking, but knowing that Jerkins produced all three of these tracks, this here takes the cake, that and finishing what was left of Michael Jackson's musical career). YUCK!!!!, I mean Chante is 100 times more talented than all three of those women and Rodney Jerkins combined, needless to say I always skip that track. "Heartbeat", wasn't helping matters either, then there's "I've Got The Love" and "I Started Crying" (me too @ 13.99 plus tax I will never have again), and now I'm ready to trash this CD. Mainstream isn't worth all of this.  But then came tracks like "Easy", "I Cry To Myself", "In My Life", "Love And The Woman", and "This Moment Is Mine", which saves the album from the pits of suckdom. This where Chante shines, and shows why fans care about her. In all, I say it's a good CD, but you know deep inside you could have gotten better.
