 I got older and was able to follow the storyline much better, and this one totally blew me away.  * The nature of which they were fighting was sad for both sides. The Earth, because this was a pre-emptive strike out of fear, knowing what they went through with the Zentradi, they couldn't afford to see if they Zen's elder's The Robotech Masters came for diplomacy or just to say hi!!! The Robotech Masters manipulation on their people and the need to do anything it took to stay that way, was really depressing. *Interaction between Dana, Nova, and Marie Crystal was funny, the tension between the three was entertaining. *Southern Cross had it's cheesy moments and annoying characters (Dana, Bowie-Musica, Commander Leonard), but that's a far cry on what I had to endure when I watched Macross. The cheesiness and the annoyance didn't take away from the flow of things either, which I appreciated. *The clone of Zor Prime brought out alot in these stories. His inner conflict is a thing a beauty.  I didn't like Southern Cross when I first watched it, but I was young and so caught up in Macross. The second time I watched it I gave it a chance, followed it thouroghly, and think that this one here is the strongest storywise of the three.
