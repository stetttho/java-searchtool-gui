 My real rating for Contraband is 4.5.   First off, I didn't expect this to sound like GNR or STP, and if it did, that would of been a huge trainwreck. I missed those two bands, but I have to put things in perspective. Yet, like everyone else their pasts was why I got the album.  The star here is Scott Weiland as he almost bares his soul in each and every song, especially in the songs "Falling To Pieces", "You Got No Right", and "Loving the Alien".   This falls short of 5 because there's nothing innovating and different. Slash, Duff and company are solid, but I expected something a little edgier and dirty. That's small and forgettable stuff though. Guitar solos were mainly on point, but short of making an idiot of myself as if I was playing the guitar. That's how I am, I'm quick to do that on a guitar solo I like, in any genre of music.  My favorite tracks, "Slither", "Sucker Train Blues", "Illegal i Song", and previously mentioned "Loving The Alien".   This is a solid gem, falls short of a classic.
