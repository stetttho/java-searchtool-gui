 From "Is It A Crime?" to "Maureen", there's nothing on this album that I don't like. Like it's predacessor, "Diamond Life", the entire album has a melancholy feel to it, but this has quite a few tracks you can relax too, but minus love ballad, well a solid one, in my opinion, not that it matters, a genuine love ballad would of killed the entire mood of the album.  Vocally Sade is at her best, until "Love Deluxe" came out. The rest of the band was superb as always, but unlike the other albums, they didn't outshine the vocalists and didn't take a step back when they were needed most (That was the feeling I got on "Lover's Rock"). Everything on this album is as close to perfect.   Favorite tracks include, the jazz/blues-like track, "Is It A Crime" (Do not listen to this track, if you've broken up with your girl/guy, and can't get them out of your head). Another one, of course is "Sweetest Taboo" (not a ballad), up tempo love song playas can dig. "Fear", "War of the Hearts", the super depressing "Maureen", and "Punch Drunk" are some of the other strong tracks on here.   This album is a must have for any die hard fan. I gave this one 5 stars because it stands above all the other classic Sade albums. Promise is to the Sade collection, what the Black Lion is to Voltron. So if this album isn't in your collection, get it.
