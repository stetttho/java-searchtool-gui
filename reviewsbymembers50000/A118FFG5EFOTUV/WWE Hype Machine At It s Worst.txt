  This book had promise, then Vinny Mac and crew had to work their way into it. In all, the book is not a bad read, there were just some parts that baffled me to death.   The nerve of Flair to bash the likes of Savage, Bret Hart, and Foley to name a few is puzzling. He could of stated he didn't like neither style, but he went on to trash their accomplishments in the business, that's classless and unlike the Flair I watched and read about. It gets better, the talk of veterans needing to put younger guys over, but then praising long time politicians like Undertaker, Triple H, and Shawn Michaels, guys  who would rather pass kidney stones and cancer tumors, than put anyone else over. That's when you can tell, it's the WWE spin machine.   In conclusion, it's up to you if you want to purchase, but beware, alot of wacky WWE spin is on display. The stories of the old days are worth the buy, I will admit!
