 I agree with on reviewer stating that the matches from the past five years should of been left out. But if they had to show one in it's entirety, the Benoit/Angle cage match should of been it, instead of the Edge/Angle one.  This is a DVD, where the extras are more important than the feature.   The feature is a show hosted by Coach, and Coach basically tells use the background of each match. The matches are heavily clipped and we could of done without secondhand storytelling. I'll be intrested in what Spike and Dreamer have to say when there is the Best of ECW DVD, which is now owned by King Vince. I know Bruno, Bret, and Hogan would rather worship Satan than talk to Vince right now, but Flair, Snuka, Morraco, and some others featured on that DVD were available.   On the extras, for those fans who know nothing about WWE Champs before Hogan, get this DVD, and get to know Bob Backlund and Bruno Sammartino, two of the greatest WWE Champions of all time. The old NWA is covered and the fact they have the TA/Blanchard "I Quit" match is worth buying this DVD period. The Snuka/Morraco match and Bret/Owen match are must see matches as well. There were some worth cage matches left out, but in all a solid DVD, the WWE is on to something here, and it has nothing but cool written all over it.
