 I've had time to digest this album. First off, the album as a whole is worth the purchase. Songs like "Diary", "Dragon Days", and "If I Was Your Woman" are some of the albums gems. While songs like "You Don't Know My Name", and "If I Ain't Got You" will join tracks from her last album like "Fallen", as a staple of her unique sound. The more she matures, ventures out into different things, she will quickly develope a style, where music fans can say "That's Alicia"!     My gripe are with the first three full tracks. They just didn't work. Other than that, great follow up!
