 Let's bring on the unhelpful votes, since there's alot of people that think this garbage is good.  First off Mary J she isn't, first off Mary had producers and writers who gave her material that she could work with. In her early years, she never covered anything she couldn't handled and was allowed to grow as the years went by. Mary brought raw emotion and attitude to tracks in a way the music world didn't see before, and that's why we love her till this day. I see none of that in Keysha Cole, none whatsoever, this girl flat out sucks, and that's being nice.  After listening to "I Should Of Cheated", I felt cheated out of my money and the four minutes of my life I'll never see again. The torture reached a climax when "I Found You" blasted, unfortunately found my ears. Hearing her voice cracking and all, made being deaf sound a little pleasant, where's Simon when you need him. This girl can not sing, she makes Total sound like En Vogue, Ashanti sound like Aretha Franklin, and Mya sound like Patti LaBelle. Soon as her voice comes on the radio, the dog start howling.  The sad thing is, we'll have to endure her for another year or two. If I had my way and saw this chick in concert, I'd have a bullhorn and tell her to shut up. And no, acting ghetto and dressing in what Foxy Brown and Lil Kim tossed out the window isn't sexy, is downright slutty. Sane people take a pass on this please, don't insult your intelligence.
