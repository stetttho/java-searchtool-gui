 This is simply one of the better debut albums I've heard in a long time. Her voice is a haunting reminder of Sade, but don't be fooled, honey has her own unique style, which is unheard of.  I won't go song for song, but I will tell you musically it flirts with jazz, a little neo soul, with a nice touch of African melody. It doesn't hurt that she's fine as all outdoors as well. I can tell you personally this is a CD I'm proud to have in my collection.
