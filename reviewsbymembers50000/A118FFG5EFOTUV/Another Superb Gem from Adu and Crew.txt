 I wish I could give it 4 3/4 stars, this is an outstanding album, but falls short of being as good as "Promise".   Vocally this is Sade at her best, however the others steal the spotlight on the majority of the songs. "No Ordinary Love" and "Kiss of Life" are classic Sade songs, while "No Ordinary Love" follows the melancholy formula the band is infamous for, "Kiss of Life" follows the formula of previous classics like "Smooth Operator" and "Sweetest Taboo", but this time, well for me, I can call this a genuine Sade love ballad, a rarity in my books. I brought those two tracks up, because on these two, the vocalist and the band flow like a summer breeze. On "Pearls" and "Feel No Pain", Sade is all preachy and clearly gets her message out and doesn't overdo it, like other artist who make you scream, "we get the picture". Again, the vocalist and band flow nicely together. My favorite track on the entire album, is "Bullet Proof Soul", just an all around nice cut.  The rest, it's all the band. Sade blesses "Cherish The Day" lovely, but the guy on bass is blessing it so much better to the point that I want Sade to stop singing. Same goes for "I Couldn't Love You More, where Sade isn't outshined so much, but again the other guys are the real stars. The band raps things up with "Mermaids", just them this time, maybe Sade was like, "Screw it, just do your thing guys." Mermaid falls short of "Siempre Hay Esperanza" and "Punch Drunk", but I was far from disappointed.   I noticed that on this album they kept it safe, which is good, but nothing groundbreaking, nothing new. Just updated Sade joints, which is always good, but looking back, that would be the only drawback to this album, outside of the band outshing the vocalist, that should always balance out.  In conclusion, this is another solid gem from Sade. If you don't have it, stop reading this and get it fool!
