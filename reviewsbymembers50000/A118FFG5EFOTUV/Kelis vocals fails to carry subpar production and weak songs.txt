 I like Kelis, and the reason this album is in the positive, is the fact that she cane really sing. Her talents vocally way exceeds what was given to her here. Tracks like "Glow", "Millionaire","Attention", and "Keep It Down", are solid tracks, but not as strong as "Sugar Honey Iced Tea" the stand out track on the entire album. The final track "Marathon", was good but left me hanging as the song ended just as it got good.  The other tracks I totally dislike or just plain baffled by. I could care less for the "In Public" featuring Nas, maybe it's because I'm older, or that I know such a childish track is above both artists. "Milkshake" is another one that made me frown, I could rant all day about this one. The Neptunes were able to bless Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears with some nice tracks, and all they could give one of their signature artist was this mess. And I say that because, previous tracks like "Caught Out There" were brilliant and did a great job showcasing the talents of both artist and producers, "Milkshake" was the total opposite, yeah it was a hit, but it also sucked. I almost didn't want to buy this album because of that one track alone. The rest of the songs are total skip material, they weren't bad but far from being good. It was like being in a car wreck and only getting whiplashed. Not so bad you didn't die, but not good either.       As a fan, I liked to see Kelis work with people, who recognize and respect her talents, and further her to longevity, because she is vocally better than Alicia Keys and sexier than Beyonce.
