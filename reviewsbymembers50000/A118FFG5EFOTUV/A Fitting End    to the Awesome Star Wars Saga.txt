 This was the one I was looking forward, watching Anakin transform to the good man he was to Darth Vader. After watching Clones, it erased whatever ill will I had for Menace and Clones, which was minimal, but serious.  The Good:  The beginning scenes where Obi Wan and Anakin are battling droid ships in space, then in the ship, watching R2 kick some butt, all the way to where Palpatine orders Anakin to kill Dooku. The opening scenes were incredible, action packed, and suspenseful, and did a good job for setting the tone.  Lightsaber battles. Obi Wan/Anakin vs. Dooku, Obi Wan vs. Grevious, Mace vs. Palps, and Anakin( now Darth Vader) vs. Obi Wan, oh and Yoda vs. Palps. All were intense, though you alredy knew the outcome. And for those SW fans debating, Mace kicked Palps butt cleanly, before he met his demise.  Tying up loose ends. Whether big holes or the smallest holes, Lucas filled them all on this one. On "A New Hope" for example, did Obi Wan recognize R2 on Tatooine? How would he come in contact with Chewbacca? Well Episode III gives you the answers.   The Bad  Cheesy dialogue between Padime and Anakin.  New holes being opened, like how did Leia know about her mother when she died shortly after she was born.  R2 not being at his former masters funeral, okay omit that, just mad cuz I saw Jar Jar's face.  I'm not going into major details, Rather you check out the DVD yourself and come to your own conclusions. If your a die hard fan, make reservations now and add this gem to your Star Wars collection. Haven't seen it, dying to see for yourself and sick of reading and hearing about it, pick it up once it comes out.
