 This was an awesome PPV. This PPV sadly, would be one of the last two great PPV before the Attiude era came to an end.      The Good   Triple H vs. Austin (2 out of 3 falls) I personally said this was the best match of 2001, simply awesome, non stop chaos here.      The Rock vs. Angle. I thought Angle really proved he was a legit main eventer here. As Tazz would say, this one here is a rocketbuster.      Jericho vs. Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero vs. X-Pac. Amazing fatal four way by three of the best workers today and X-Pac.      The Dudleys vs. Edge & Christian vs. The Undertaker & Kane   Standard solid stuff by the Dudleys and E&C, I dug Taker and Kane whipping tale, but thankfully they didn't go over.      Stephanie McMahon vs. Trish Stratus. Everyone expected disaster, but this was an overall entertaining cat fight. Trish would go on to see better days as Molly Holly( who's on the PPV as well), an ex-ho of the Godfather, and an ECW alum would help freshen up the Women's division.         The Mediocre   Jerry Lawler vs. Steven Richards. Lawler was gamed, but it was an off night for the usually reliable Richards, plus I really wanted to see the Kat naked. Funny thing, The Kat was fired shortly afterwards and Lawler walked out, see the two were married. However, the relationship went south and Lawler returned later on that year, the Raw after Survivor Series. Intresting match when you watch it now!      The Big Show vs. Raven   That ninja was Tori, not be confused with a shorter blonde. I miss her. Alot of wackiness, as was the case in this joke of a division. Back to Tori, that thick blonde that took her out, that's Molly Holly, for those who forgot how she looked blonde! Your usual hardcore match, with Raven selling for everyone, TGR! That mean thank God for Rhyno, who went on to have some solid hardcore matches with Raven.         Solid all aroud PPV, matches were solid and entertaining and was a perfect lead in to thet greatest Wrestlemania of all time.
