 Once purchasing this CD, I had to come to grips with the fact that these tracks were completed before "Come Away With Me". Another thing, I had to come to grips with was this was Malick's album, with Jones as the featured vocalist. That being said, after listening to the CD, I was disappointed.  Norah's voice and blues doesn't really mix. The flirtation with jazz and country, suits her better, as her last two albums demonstrated. She was all over the place vocally here, but grant it, she was an unknown at the time. Personally, I think she sounds better doing what she does now.  Musically the album is one point, sad to say that Norah's voice does nothing for the band, as a whole. I can say there were two songs that I like, "Heart of Mine" and the title track "New York City", great songs, but falls short of what she's done afterwards.  If I had to do it over again, this would be a CD, where I would burn a couple of tracks off of, if my buddy had it. I'd midly reccomend purchasing this one.
