 Once upon a time there was a band called October Project that was destroyed because of money and politics with record executives.  Given a chance, ten years later we would have been able to continue to experience this group with mary fahl, but alas, they parted and maybe for the best.  Emil, Julie and Maria now are getting ready to release a new October Project, and the time could not be better.  I connected with this CD, exactly one year after my grandfather died, this tower of strength that seemed to be a constant until the day he died.  I was driving home to visit my grandmother to mark his anniversary to be with my family and remember.  I heard Where You Are while driving and I just started to sob.  I felt like he was right there with me, "where you are, do you know I think of you?.....knowing it goes on forever, far beyond us, far behind."  It was the most beautiful calming feeling I've ever felt on this crisp April evening.  I was the only one on the road.  It was at that moment I thought, God is in this music.  Not being a religious man, I found a sense of incredible comfort in that though.  This chapter of the October Project is closed, but at least we have two amazing cd's to mark thier existance; echo's of the past binding us in amazement.  I only am giving four stars because I know how amazing the second album is.  They are both filled with stories of life, spirituality and absolute beauty.  I hope to be getting the new OP cd when it is released soon, and I hope it is magical and amazing, just like the original, but different to grow and change with these turbulent times.
