 Maybe im pushing 30 and music has lost it's magic, but after hearing this album, all I can say is: this album is incredible.  Nothing out there sounds quite like it.  I don't think there is a single bad track on this disc.  It sound is well layered, well constructed and all hooks are appropriate and catchy.  It is an edgy pop album pure and simple.  My favorite tracks are of course Put The Needle.., I Begin.., and Don't Wanna..., but I also love Piece of Time for it's 80's funk/synth sound and On The Loop for the exact same reason.  If you really missing how music used to make you feel back in the day, then this album will really make you crazy....  Check out the incredible bootleg remixes of I Begin to Wonder mixed into Dead or Alive's Spin me Round and also the amazing..absolutely amazing mix of Don't Wanna Lose This feeling mixed into Madonna's into the groove.  Dannii...keep making music like this.
