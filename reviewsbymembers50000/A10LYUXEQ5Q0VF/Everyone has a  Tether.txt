 Discovering Sarah Harmer a few years back was one of those rare music moments where you know you will have this one spinning for many many years.  Don't get me wrong, 'you were here' is a stellar album and the backporch on a late summer evening laid back tone of 'songs for clem' holds it's own, but the simple pleasure of 'All of Our Names' is the equivalent of taking a breath and letting it out really really slow.  This album is filled with perfect moments, a mosaic of sound that conjurs the most amazing images while you listen.  The album is rural, not urban in it's pace.  It keeps your attention and it at times takes your breath away.  It is a sign waving back and forth in the breeze, a pickup driving down a dusty road, the small town corner diner, the dizziness you experience when you break off a relationship.  Sarah's craft for songwriting is embodied in one line from 'tether': Living this close to the road/you question your vulnerability.  She weaves and molds her craft into some of the finest songwriting out there these days and deliveres an album that is beautiful and gives us hope that really true insightful artists still exists
