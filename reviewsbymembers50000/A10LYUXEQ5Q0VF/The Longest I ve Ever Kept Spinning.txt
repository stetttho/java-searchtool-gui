 I guess I rate the longevity of music by how long I keep listening to it.  I bought this album right before I went away to college failing to understand how it would impact me at the time.  Since then I've downloaded it onto my computer at work, put many songs on my mp3 player and even mixed in many songs to cd's i've created for road trips or variety.  I have to say this disc is perfect, and the fact that Annie pulls off these covers with such conviction suggests that she believes in every word. It was last year when I saw Serendipity and Waiting in Vain came on during a scene when I realized what a delayed effect this disc has on people.  Downtown lights is still as cinematic and touching as it was when I first heard it.  Don't let it bring you down, my least favourite in 1995 has since become a song I almost immediately return to each visit.  No more I love you's will carry me through life I feel.  I think you can feel every word on this album and relate.  Having heard very few of the originals leaves little room for comparison.  To me, this album is full of best friends and memories and maybe that is why it is so powerful, but it still amazes me how many years have gone by and how often I return to this disc.  I am anxious for her new release and only hope that I can feel a little of that magic all over again.  This album is classic and a true achievement.  Too bad it took me 7 years to come up with these words.
