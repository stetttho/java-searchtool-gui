 Of course one would compare this album to No Angel given that it is a sophomore release.  Even so, it is best to try to separate yourself from the previous album and not make a naturally possible comparison.  I think this album is amazingly well put together in such a way that it has a 'delayed' effect on the listener.  Most of the songs exist 'within a moment'.  In white flag, it is a happenstance meeting on a street, don't leave home exists within a blowup with your lover, sand in my shoes is in an apartment when you just get home.  Every song is a little chapter or story and the disc tells a message of love lost, wisdom gained and moving on into some great unknown.  There is such emotional impact on this disc that really can only come from someone in their late 20's or early 30's when life is taking off in many different directions, only amplified by the touching and natural ambience of Dido's voice.  I can't get off the silent echos of See You When You're Forty and the "wouldn't have picked you out" windy ending that literally puts you in a trance and carries you away in a complete moment.   This disc is a sleeper like No Angel and is best sampled over time because the impact of the themes and various complexities are what make it great.  Otherwise, you might just pass this disc over and say it is boring.  Don't compare it and give it time.  It really is a touching piece of work...
