 After hearing half acre a few weeks ago and almost immediately after buying rabbit songs, this cd was released.  I was about two years late on the HEM bandwagon.  Regardless, I held off bying this cd because I wanted to fall totally in love with Rabbit Songs.  Needless to say, I broke down today and bought it.  It is every bit as solid as Rabbit Songs and every bit as emotionally driven.  It sounds like music used to sound when I was a kid, when music had a soul and the words really meant something and years later you would still remember how that music made you feel.  Sally Ellyson and a clarinet together are two of the most beautiful sounding things that compliment each other so perfectly on this disc.  I have no standout favorite because I just got the disc and have only listed to it twice, but I did get the 'warm fuzzies' that I had when I first heard Half Acre.  Good enough for me.  Hem is really special, and I am greatful to have discovered them.
