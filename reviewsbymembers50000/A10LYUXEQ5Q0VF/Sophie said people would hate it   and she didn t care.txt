 About a year ago, I saw Sophie live and she talked about how sweet cantaloupe would come out around Christmas of 2003, and then with several delays and a title change, wilderness formerly known as 'sweet cantaloupe' emerged. I admit the production is glossy and sometimes Sophie stretches her voice too far, but as a final package, it works. It works in the same way that Whaler workes (my favorite Sophie album) and for that I am happy.  I love jazz/pop infusions, and so what if she worked with the Berman Brothers.  They created a largly jazz glossy pop infusion.  Sophie said people were going to hate the album because it has a glossy sound.  Again, it works overall and the finished product at first listen was filled with skepticism from yours truly. I found myself humming Beautiful Girl for weeks prior to the release practically biting my nails to the bone to hear the rest of the album.  My first listen was depressing because I was hoping to hear orgasmic delights such as Damn, or another Right Beside You (thank you Stephen Lipson for this amazing track by the way) or even downright intense tracks such as The Darkest Childe.  I didn't put it away...I love Sophie and she has been such a constant in my car, my house and on my iPOD, so how could I possibly dislike this album?? Well, after many listens, I fell hopelessly in love, and I think that is the key to truly connecting with this disc: multiple listens. I didn't just want to hum along to Beautiful Girl anymore, I want to scream it out loud, I wanted to feel Adrienne and SweetSexyWoman, sing along to Walking on Thin Ice, make love to Feelin' High and Soul Lover, and just be left speechless by Angel of Darkness....and ultimately get lost in Sophie's music.  Feelin' High drips of the passion that came along with Damn, and it is actually playing as I write this.  Truly unbelieveable track.        I highly recommend this disc with the caveat that it will take some time to get used to.  My only regret is that Sophie didn't work with Stephen Lipson again.  I think that collaboration was pure genius.
