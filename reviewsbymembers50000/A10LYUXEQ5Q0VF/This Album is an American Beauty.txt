 After the final track ended, i said "what?" This album is stunning.  It is probably the most self reflective recording ever made where you as the listener actually feel her sentiments.  I guess some critics have to be negative, but one after I heard Nothing Fails and just got chills or even Nobody Knows Me and realized how much of our personality we hide for the sake of other's judgment, I think this is the best thing she's ever done.  This album has attitude, it has a message, it is cohesive, it is singable, it is emotional, it is fun, it is jaw dropping and eye opening and it is life.  Ask youself what are the most important things in life  and then go listen to this cd....this type of modern life is not for me, this type of modern life is not for free.....
