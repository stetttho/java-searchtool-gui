 Sometimes you wish you could just write a review about the author rather than the book.  R.A. Salvatore is one of those.... With the popularity of Science Fiction and Fantasy books today, the truely "excellent"  authors often get lumped in with the just "good" ones.  If  Salvatore had written these novels 20 years ago, he would probably be  viewed today as one of the masters of the genre -- with the likes of  Tolkien, Zelazny, and Asimov.  The books are THAT good!  Salvatore knows  how to bring detail and life to a story without miring it in wordiness.   His writing is clean, powerful, and evocative.  You find yourself quickly  drawn in to the characters, rejoicing with their successes and having  sorrow for their failures.  You feel what they feel... Oh, and (without  saying too much so as to spoil anything), kudos to an author who is not  afraid to kill-off major characters in an epic-style adventure!  The good  guys don't always wear white, and the heroes don't always win... Read  every Salvatore novel you can get your hands on; I haven't found one yet  that I didn't enjoy!
