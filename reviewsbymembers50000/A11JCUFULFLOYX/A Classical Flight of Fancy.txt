 I also read this series as a child and it sparked my imagination.  Lewis does a masterful job of drawing you in to his world and leaves a lasting impression in your mind.  I read them nearly 20 years ago, and I can still  recall the title of all seven books, and the plots of every adventure.   Simply wonderful!  Now I want to read them all over again....
