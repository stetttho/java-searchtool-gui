 I realize that this product is based on the idea of the "Core Rules" for the AD&D game, but this was supposed to be the "Expansion" on those Core Rules -- hence the inclusion of  the "Complete" series of Class & Race books.  Where they  dropped the ball, in my opinion, was not including the Forgotten Realms  Adventures hardcover material, as well as the Faiths & Avatars and  Powers & Pantheons supplements.  These three books contain loads of  invaluable source info for mages and specialty priests.  Second, the fact  that the program seems to lack the ability to factor in kit bonuses during  PC/NPC creation is, well, annoying at the least, and frustrating at its  worst. That said, the rest of the product is wonderful.  The  hyper-linked, help file version of the books is awesome; I carry my laptop  loaded with this program to every gaming session I go to, whether I'm  playing or GMing.  No longer do I have to carry 4 hardcovers and multiple  softcovers to have the information I need.  I have stats, indexed and  searchable documents, dice rollers, maps, and PC/NPC character sheets all  at my beckon call.  And, in most cases, I can find an item, spell  description, or rule in one of the books in less time than someone else can  whip out their book and look it up. One of the knocks I've heard about  the Expansion is that, since 3rd edition will render it obsolete in less  than a year, it's not worth buying.  Please, people!  Its a small price to pay for the convience of having all these resources at  your finger-tips, even if it is only for the next 9 months.  When I bought  mine, I knew I'd be getting about a year's worth of use out of it, so it  was definitely worth it, but even if I hadn't bought it then, I'd still  find it a deal at this price now...
