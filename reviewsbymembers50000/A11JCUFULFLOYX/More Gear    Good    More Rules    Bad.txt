 The danger of expansion-type supplements to any RPG system is the tendancy to over-burden the system with too many new rules; rules that slow down play and can mire a session in number-crunching and extra dice-rolling.  Unfortunately, the RBB2 does exactly that... Don't get me wrong, the book  is packed with some really good ideas and long-needed rules clarifications  from RBB1, but in some areas the development team clearly missed the mark  (for anyone who has already purchased the book, the new "flux  ratings" in Sensors/ECM/ECCM rules are a prime example of this).   Also, the modifications to the vehicle armor and body rules have really  changed rigger combat, and I don't believe in a good way; we had two  experienced riggers get their banshees turned into scrap-metal by one  missile shot -- hardly a result conducive to enjoyable gameplay. The new  drones and vehicles are nice, and the vehicle creation rules are a  long-overdue addition (though again, seemingly a bit over-complex).  My  advice: get it for the new gear, ignore the majority of the rules, and run  off of rigger combat info from the SR3 hardcover...
