 Gamers (particularly those of us who played D&D, AD&D, or any other related systems) have faced persecution from the time that games like D&D began to gain popularity.  The author continually exposes her  ignorance to gaming (in general) and D&D throughout this  "book."  I use quotations because this truely cannot be  considered a book; this is sheer and simple propaganda from an  unltra-conservative, right-wing POV.  As many other reviews have mentioned,  she uses fautly logical and false premises to build her arguements and  conclusions.  The "truth" about gaming is simple; there are a lot  of us, we come from all walks of life, represent all age groups,  ethnicities, and socio-economic backgrounds.  Some of these people even  have problems -- welcome to STATISTICAL REALITY!   The crux of the matter  is that, even when you consider the author's claims that some 100  documented crimes have been associated with people who played D&D, if  you look at the national (or international) figures for suicide, violent  crime, etc., you find that gamers are far LESS LIKELY (based on straight  comparison on the number of gamers vs. the number of these  "incidents") to do these things than our peers.  The only thing  in her book close to the mark is the generalizations that we are  intelligent and have active imaginations -- these are the things that draw  us to the game.  If you don't fit that profile, then the game probably  doesn't appeal to you; my guess is that is really the author's problem...  ;->
