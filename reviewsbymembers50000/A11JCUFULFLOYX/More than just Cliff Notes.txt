 If you think that the Chronicles of Narnia ought to be required reading for children, then the Companion to Narnia ought to be required reading for us adults that fell in love with Narnia as children.  Yes, I'm sure that if  you had to write a paper or do a report on any of the Chronicles for  school, this book would be invaluable.  But the fact is, it goes far beyond  that to a much broader audience... C.S. Lewis's Chronicles represent some  of the finest high-Fantasy novels ever written, period.  But for most of  us, at least at the first reading, this is all they were.  As we grow  older, and read the Chronicles again and again, we begin to discover more  of the meaning behind the writing; this book guides you further along that  path of discovery.  It is well-organized and very thorough; I have had  little difficulty finding any of the references I wanted to explore. If  you want a person to love the Chronicles, buy the series for them when they  are a child.  If you want them to appreciate it the way you do, buy them  the Companion when they grow a bit older...
