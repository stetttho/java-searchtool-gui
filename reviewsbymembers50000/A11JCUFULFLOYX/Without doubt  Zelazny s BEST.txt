 Okay, so I've got a biased view-point.  I love Zelazny's work.  His "Chronicles of Amber" series was one of the first science fiction/fantasy works on an "adult level" that I read (I was  maybe 12 at the time), and his twisted, convoluted style of writing had me  turning page after page, unable to put the book down. "Unicorn  Variations" represents much of that style.  It examines man's failures  under pressure, (and ironically) man's ability to perform extrodinary feats  under that same pressure.  It uses an oft-humuorous touch to describe a  serious subject.  It draws upon fantasy to explain reality.  Get the  picture?  Rarely does Zelazny ever come right out and say what he means;  it's much more fun to keep the reader guessing the whole way through. The  version I have of the audio tape is read by Star Trek/Deep Space 9's Odo  (Rene something-or-other -- sorry, his last name escapes me at this time);  I enjoyed listening to it almost as much as reading the story for myself...
