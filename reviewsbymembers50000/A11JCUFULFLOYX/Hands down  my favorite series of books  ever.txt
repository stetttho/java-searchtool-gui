 I nearly cried the day I learned that Roger Zelazny had passed; I knew that there could never be another Amber novel again... This compilation is a "must-have" for any serious science fiction/fantasy  enthusiast.  It details the adventures of a family of god-like beings from  the "One True Realm" -- Amber.  Corwin, a Prince of Amber and the  primary character of the first 5 novels (referred to as the  "Chronicles of Amber"), is the quintessential epic hero.  He  fails as often as he succeeds, he often finds himself in far over his head,  and ultimately comes to the realization that he must subjugate his own  personal goals for the "greater good".  The second 5 novels deal  with the antics of Corwin's son, Merlin.  And though his possesses great  powers, much like his father in the first series he finds himself involved  (many times as a pawn) in a struggle of epic proportions that he does not  full understand. I have introduced countless friends to the joys of  Zelazny's work in the 15+ years since I first read the "Chronicles of  Amber"; my copies of those novels still sit on my shelf, battered and  dog-eared, ready to be loaned out to the next friend who says, "Roger  Zelazny?  Who's that?" Don't be afraid of this book's monstrous  size; Zelazny's writing in engaging -- it will suck you in such that you  won't want to put it down.  The plot is convoluted -- not that it is  confusing; quite to the contrary.  It keeps you thinking you know what's  going on, only to find out 2 chapters later you were dead wrong.   Wonderfully suprising! If you can find it, do yourself the favor and buy  "The Visual Guide to Castle Amber" as well.  Don't read it until  after you've read the 10 novels; after you've looked at the "Visual  Guide", then go back and read them all again!
