 Ok this is a really intersting device.  I got this as a gift from a friend and my house is set up with half carpeting and half tile floors.  Obviously you are not going to be stupid enough to use this on carpeting....... So for me this does work pretty well. You have to use your virtual walls to make sure you keep this from going where you dont want it to go.  It really does clean your floors nicely.  My only complaints are that if you have a house made of all tile floors, you will have to reset this and empty the tank.....  It is expensive.......almost 400 dollars........you have to use a special cleaning solution which is not readily available.  Lets face it, it is a unique gimic.........  It really does not work any better then a mop and some spic and span.  Use that.......save your money, spend it on something frivilous for yourself.......   Really how long does it take to mop your floor??   One other thing this is battery operated......if it is anything like my rechargable battery things, it will not be working for long.
