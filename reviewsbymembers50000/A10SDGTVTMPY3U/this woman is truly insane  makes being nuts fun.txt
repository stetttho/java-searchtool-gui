 I really have to say that this was a very unique book.  This woman is funny, she has a lot to give,  she does not sugar coat things in the least.  She gives a realistic discription of life with bulimia, and does not try to wrap things up in a nice perfect package.  There is no sugar coating.  This woman is plain and simple crazy, but at least she admits it, is not ashamed of it , and does not make excuses.  She is like the typical eating disorder patient.  They really do to an extent enjoy the disease.  I loved the fact that she slammed the insurance companies. This should be required reading for anyone who wants to understand more about the disease.
