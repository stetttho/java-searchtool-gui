 I have a lot of experience with hooking up vcr's , dvd's , and pal ntsc converters.  I have never in my life experienced the difficulties associated with this dvd recorder.  It absolutely will not interface with my tv [I have a panasonic tv}  The only way I could get this to even interface at all was by hooking it through the vcr which it says you are not supposed to do .  you have to program the channels into it.  What if you just want to use it to convert your vcr tapes on to dvd?  I was not able to do this at all.  It is a worthless piece of equiptment, and unfortunately since I have spent about 3 months trying to hook it up [without benefit of their technical service which is non existent}  and now it is too late to return it.  I am so disappointed, do not buy this piece of pooh.
