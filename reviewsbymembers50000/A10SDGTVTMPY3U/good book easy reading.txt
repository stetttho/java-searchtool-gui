 This is a nice book. There are no secret cures, it is all done with a lot of hard work.  The book is written simplistically , and is a very quick read.  If you are looking for ways to make your self a better anorexic this is not going to do it,  it was an effective book that showed there is a life outside of anorexia.  The only complaint is that she was lucky and she did not have to deal with the insurance companies [this is not her fault of course}.  I think that she is a role model for people who want to know that there is a life outside of anorexia.
