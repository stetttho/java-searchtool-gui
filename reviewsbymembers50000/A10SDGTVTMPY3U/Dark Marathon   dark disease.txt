 I really thought that this was a fantastic book that never really got the critical praise it deserved.  I serioulsy doubt that anyone will even read this review because the book has been off the market for some time.  I had to special order it, but that was well worth it.  This book starts out telling about a world class runner, she develops anorexia, and everything else in her life fell apart.  She could not read, go to school, etc.  she could not even find dffective medical care.  She becomes so depressed, she throws herself off a bridge.  There were legal issues involved with her poor medical care. On top of all of this , Mary has managed to rebound and have a pretty productive life.  I have to say actually that this was one of the best books I have ever read.  It is one of the most depressing books as well.  I highly recommend this book.
