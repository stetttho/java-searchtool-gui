 I actually bought two of these for my two year old twins.  It is a great toy.  I had them hidden and planned to wait for Christmas, but then my twins [who are two years old} found them.  The toy is for ages three and over because it says that small parts could be generated.....  I guess if something breaks.......  I would find this hard to believe, it is very well constructed, and I let the kids play with this { I did not know that it was for three and over when I bought it }.  It is a very safe toy.  When you touch her forehead, her hair grows.  my twins love this doll and love the hair.  They usually get bored with toys almost immediately, but they have been playing with this toy non stop for almost two weeks.  I have never seen a toy that they liked like this.  It has the other features of Dora with the two different languages.  This doll plays several cute tunes.  One other thing.........  My twins fight over this doll........  each one of them wants two of them..... they are not satisified with their own toy, they want to have their sisters toy as well.  Maybe I will have to buy a third one of these.
