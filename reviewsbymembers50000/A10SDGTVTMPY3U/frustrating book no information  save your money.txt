 This book is very well done you will be totally frustrated by the choices that she makes and the justifications that she has for them.  It is obvious half way through the book that the author is just flying through life on the seat of her pants.  One of the most interesting things is that she has basically accepted the desease and her condition.  She totally blames many of her episodes on her thyroid..........why this author has not gotten this condition straightened out is beyond me.  Fixing hyperthyroidism is one of the easier problems to fix.  She gives us an insite into her life by telling us about her tubal ligation at age 24 as well as her battles with an abusive spouse which she totally defends and goes back to...........  i think that this book would be best for someone who really has a parent who totally does not understand why their kid does not want to get well.........lauren is obviously one of those patients.  She advertises the fact that she is a respiratory tech and is in the medical field and can not seem to find anyone that is qualified to treat her hyperthroidism...........obviously she is totally not interested in getting well.......it is obvious that she has not figured out how to get well in fact , there are some passages that make me thing that she is grasping to embrase the disease.  I applaud her for being truthful and not wrapping the book together as one happy textbook ending.
