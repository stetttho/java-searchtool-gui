 Ok well I have to justify this by saying that I do like watching ice skating.  If you are reading this book to find out the facts about top top skaters like scott hamilton you will not find them there.  What you will find is a riviting story about a skater who was good enough to make it into two ice shows but was not good enough to make it to the olympics.  This was a great story because I always thought that life in the ice shows was all glamour...............  clearly it is not.   She tells about how unfair some of the selection processes were, she tells about the weight issues, and she tells about how skaters were chosen based on their visas.  She went to two different ice shows and neither of them was very good.   {as an aside I found out that one of my casual friends from highschool was in  one of the shows that katherine was in, and she was dropped..........she had an eating disorder too!......her life did not turn out as successfully as katherines so I believe it}  There is quite a bit about eating disorders here in this book.  She does not give tips though but she does tell about her depth and dispair associated with it.  There was a lot of info in this book that made it extra interesting.......  when katherine left the show clearly anorexic, her mother was thrilled at how wonderful she she looked!!!!!  She tells a lot about her life at colgate university.  She did skating exhibitions during the half time at hockey games.  For me another interesting thing was how katherine managed to change her eating disorder around.  She had therapy and found a sport where she had to eat healthy to do well.....triathalons.     Overall I have to say that this is one of the best books I have ever read. My write up just does not do it justice. The girl is real normal person with struggles we all have faced. She is more then just a skater.
