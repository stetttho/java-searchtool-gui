 I saw this book and bought it to figure out what all of the fuss was about......  I figured that directions were not meant for me so I just jumped in and did a puzzle.......a medium difficulty one.........well I did not get it so I went to the beginning and read their tips..........  it really helped a lot.  After about an hour, I finally figured out what the deal with sudoku was.  It is addicting. I really like this book because it has a lot of different puzzles, lots of different difficulty.......  I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who wants to start sudoku.
