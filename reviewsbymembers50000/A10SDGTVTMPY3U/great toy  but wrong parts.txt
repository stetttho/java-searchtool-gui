 This is a great toy,  after I finally put it together , the babies love it.  However, the rocker came with out the right type of screws.  I was amazed by this, and almost broke the thing trying to put the right screws in place.   Even the pictures in the instructions have different types of screws.  The company has received a copy of my letter, but they never wrote back.  It was just lucky that I was able to buy the correct screws.
