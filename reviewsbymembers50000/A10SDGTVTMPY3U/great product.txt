 These were a luxury item which I treated myself to.  I love these.  The lobster meat and rolls come packaged on ice and there is no worry about spoilage.  The lobster meat is pure lobster.  They list mayonaise as an ingredient {I hate mayo} fortunatley I did not see any on the meat...if there was any it was minimal. The rolls were very fresh.  You can easily grill them and have a meal in 3 minutes or less.  I actually ate about three of these for lunch..........it ended up being about a 45 dollar lunch worth every dime!
