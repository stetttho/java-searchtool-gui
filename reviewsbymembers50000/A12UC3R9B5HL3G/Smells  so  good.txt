 Reincarnate can be a hard shampoo to get used to, especially if you're not already using LUSH products. It doesn't 'sud up' much, and feels a little bit muddy and grainy. Don't fret though! It will certainly clean your hair, and will also leave it smelling like wonderful spices (almost as good as "Arabian Bright"). The highlights are not something that come with one or two washings, but with many many washings, and they are /very/ subtle but there. The only reason I don't give this product five stars is that it was not as conditioning as it states it is, and I needed to use another conditioning product with it.
