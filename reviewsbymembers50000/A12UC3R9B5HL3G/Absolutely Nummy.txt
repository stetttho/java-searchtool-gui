 American Cream is one of the most delightfully scented conditioners you can buy anywhere. Yes, it's vanilla and strawberry, but not that icky, thick, overly sweet chemical versions of those scents. It's warmer, and there's a bit of floral to it too.  It doesn't feel as slick in the shower as most conditioners. This is in large part because it doesn't use synthetic silicones to coat your hair. Don't let that fool you though, as your hair will still be soft and manageable when it dries. It takes a little while for your hair to get used to not having that synthetic coating of goo, so stay with it for a week or two.  I find that just a drop or two (about the size of a pencil eraser) rubbed together in my hands makes a lovely leave-in conditioner too, cutting down static and helping to detangle my hair better than the regular apply and rinse usage.
