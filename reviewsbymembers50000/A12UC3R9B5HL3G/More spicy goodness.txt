 If you haven't used a massage bar before, this takes a little getting used to. It's solid at room temperature, but melts right away in contact with skin. This bar has cinnamon and other lovely things to really 'sink in' and warm up muscles. Not as much as medicated creams like Ben Gey and such, but enough to add to a good massage. And it smells so much better. The aduki beans are a nice addition, as they definately help with the massage around the neck and upper shoulder areas, as well as the bottom of your feet. A little goes a very, very long way. I give my husband weekly back and foot rubs with this and we've had the same bar for about three-four months and its still going strong.
