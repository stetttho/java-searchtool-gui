 I recently bought the 12" iBook G4, and had an Airport Extreme card installed at the Apple Store. We didn't purchase a base since frankly, being able to be online from any room in my house would probably be dangerous for my marriage! (we're both such geeks) However, my university and local library system both have WiFi installed and it has been a godsend.  Set up was incredibly easy. My university requests that before any wireless connection is made to their system that you take your laptop in for them to set it up. They warned me how fussy and difficult the process could be, especially since they were a PC based system. But we literally turned it on and. it. worked. It's been the same when using it in the library.
