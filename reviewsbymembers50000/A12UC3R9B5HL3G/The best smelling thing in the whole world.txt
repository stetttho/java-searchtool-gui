 No, really, it is. Not too girly, not too spicy. You almost want to eat it. I don't just use it as a massage bar, but also as a perfume and general moisturizer because the scent is truly intoxicating. Lingers just enough all day that you get little 'hints' of it from time to time when you turn your head just right.  Don't worry about the chocolate and honey. It doesn't come out all at once (at least not on my bar) and the little brown streaks rub right in. Seriously, I'm not joking about that.  My second favorite LUSH product ever.
