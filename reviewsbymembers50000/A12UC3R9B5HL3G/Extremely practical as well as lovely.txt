 This big green block kind of looks like a stubby candle without a wick. But don't let the looks fool you. It's really a great conditioner in a very practical form! Some people find it hard to use, but I've never had problems, and it's easy to get used to as long as you keep a few things in mind: 1. Use hot water. It's imperative that the water be above body temperature to let the oils and butters in this conditioning bar melt on contact with hair and then rinse off cleanly. 2. With a large piece, rub the /whole thing/ down your hair slowly. Concentrate especially on the ends. Your hair will not feel like it is covered in goopy slickness like with silicone based conditioners. Don't think that this means it's not working. It really is. Enjoy the way the scent releases in the steamy shower. Mmmm. 3. Don't work this into your hair. Massaging is not necessary, and will cause you to snarl your hair up. Just stroke the bar down the length. Not side to side, not up. Just down. 4. Let it stay in for a minute or two. I step out of the water and shave while I let it sink in. 5. Again, under /hot/ water, rinse it out. Your hair will feel as though it's going to dry too clean and unconditioned. This is just because you are too used to silicones.  It's really hard to tell what's best about this conditioner. How well it works, how great the scent is, or how perfect it is for travel.
