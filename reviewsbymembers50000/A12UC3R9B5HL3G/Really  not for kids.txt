 I'm a big fan of RPG's, and I tend to like them the darker the better. And boy, this is one of the darkest RPG's I've ever seen. It's one of the best written books I've seen, next to Nobilis. It's /truly/ creepy to read and the fiction that starts the book literally made me cry. Not a book to read at night on your lonesome.  The basic theme of the game is that as we age we forget that the things that scared us as children were actually real. The Bogeyman, monsters in the closet, things under the bed. They were all real and all vicious and murderous. Children dissappear every day and sometimes they go to Closetland, where the monsters are to become slaves of the monsters or worse. You play a child, and you have to fight back against those monsers and what they want to do to you and your friends.  The authors pull no punches. One of the monsters is a pedophile. Another keeps her immortal beauty by bathing in the blood of children. There's definately glimpses of humor and cuteness in the game, but only to play up the depths of horror.  I have to admit I haven't actually played the game, mostly because other people who read the book are too weirded out to try. But from what I've seen of the game mechanics they look pretty viable if simplistic. It's more a game about atmosphere than hack and slash.
