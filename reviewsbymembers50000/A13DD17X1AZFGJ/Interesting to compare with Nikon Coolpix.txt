 I normally use a Nikon Coolpix 990, but I recently had a chance to try this Canon for a few days. It's a very different machine to handle. I think it's actually smaller than the Nikon, but the Nikon falls more easily into my hands. The screen on the Nikon is fixed on the camera body, but the lens swivels around the body. The screen on the Canon can be swivelled in any direction. So the Canon's would appear to be more flexible, yet I found that I was constantly fiddling with the screen to get it to an angle that I liked. That may just be a matter of familiarity. The screen is very bright and shows up much better in sunlight than the Nikon's. But I think the Nikon's is better quality. They are both bristling with manual controls that make them exceptionaly flexible. They could be dauntingly complicated for the novice. The Canon has the advantage of a hot shoe in case you want to use an external flashgun. Quite a big advantage since the on camera flash on both is nothing special. You will probably want to be able to get the same high quality results with flash as in natural light - if you buy the Nikon, you will have to buy their expensive external flash and the adapter. Results-wise, in natural light, I can't really say one is better than the other. They are both superb.
