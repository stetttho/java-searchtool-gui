 I think Don tried pretty hard with this one. It's a decent album, naturally paired with Chain Lightning with which it shares a similar feel and mix of songs. Don does a nice job here of some of the standards, like Love Hurts and Love Letters, and invents one or two of his own: I particularly like Crazy Eyes. Songs like Isn't It Strange, and the title track, are a little overblown though; the subtlety of his previous work is lost in these, but Don's tunes and lyrics are nonetheless catchy throughout. The remake of Castles in the Air is welcome too, but merely different from, not better than the original.
