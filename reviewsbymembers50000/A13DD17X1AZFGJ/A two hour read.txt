 A strange little book, this reminded me (in tone if nothing else) of Alain-Fournier's "Le Grand Meaulnes". But it is even slighter than the French classic. I read it straight through in a couple of hours, gripped only by the creepy section in the ruined house in the woods. The first part that deals with the way Nathan and Roy get together is pure fantasy - schoolboy dreams. The child-abuse subtext is peculiar, cheaply handled perhaps. The ending is surreal and disconnected. Grimsley writes in a dreamy cloud, but skims the surface. I started to wonder about the meaning of Nathan's return at the end (was it really him or his ghost that came back...) but decided it was like trying to psychoanalyze a soap opera. Ultimately, a flimsy, rather pointless novella.
