 . This CD is mostly tracks from Bish's first two albums, plus a couple of themes from movies. Nothing wrong with that I guess. You can't argue with the quality of the music. Many of us grew up on those first two albums and hold them in great affection. They are, justifiably, classics. The theme from Animal House is hardly recognizable as Bish, and really just a novelty on here, while the theme from "Tootsie" fits in nicely, even if Bish didn't write it himself. Trouble is, this collection offers nothing new, so perhaps you'd be better sticking with the original albums while they're still available, or grabbing Bish's excellent new stuff from his website.
