 I bought this while waiting for my first ever Mac to arrive, so I suppose it's a credit to Levitus that I felt relatively confident about using it pretty much straight away. The book covers relatively basic topics like the Finder, saving files, navigation, file management etc. As a lifelong Windows user, it all seems pretty familiar stuff. What it doesn't cover, except in passing, is stuff like how to use the Superdrive, or standard OSX Applications. Oh, they get a half-page mention, but this isn't the book that tells you everything in great detail. Think of it more as a starting point. But at least it isn't daunting and over-technical. I found the endlessly jokey tone of the writing a little irritating, like being with a used-car salesman. It's a little bit "loud" if you know what I mean. I also wasn't that impressed by the illustrations which often seem to be on a different page to the one they're described on, needlessly. Anyway: it's pretty cheap, a quick read, easy to understand, but don't expect in-depth information.
