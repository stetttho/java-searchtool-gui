 This is not an easy one to get into but you will come back for more - and then much more. A very "dense" recording, full of surprises and intriguing moments, both lyrically and musically. There's nothing obvious  here. And yet there are songs here that have been covered by the likes of  Tina turner (Steel Claw), Bonnie Raitt (Not the Only One) and David Crosby  (Helpless Heart - also chosen by Phil Collins as the one song he would take  to his desert island). Let it Happen is another stand-out track full of  bounce and soul. This is a must have for any Brady Fan.
