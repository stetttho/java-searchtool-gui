 C20th Architecture, C20th Design, C20th Photography etc. make a nice series of books, each one, despite its size, containing a surprising amount of detail and being very readable. The format and quality of printing is very attractive. C20th Cars is a worthy addition, but I wondered about some of the included models, and some of those left out. I suppose everybody has different ideas about 'significance', but for instance, TWO Ford Sierras, but no Focus? I couldn't help notice, just on first glance, one or two obvious errors in the technical details too. Even so, I would still recommend it, especially as part of an interesting series of handy reference books.
