 This is one of my very favourite albums. I bought it back in 1978 and have been playing it regularly ever since. I've never tired of it. It's a very  "complete" album, with no dud songs you'll want to skip past.  Stephen Bishop's lyrics are memorable and unusual as always; songs like  Vagabond from Heaven take quite a while to lodge in your brain but once  they do...  you just wish Stephen had been a little more prolific. This  album is very nearly as good as his Careless album.
