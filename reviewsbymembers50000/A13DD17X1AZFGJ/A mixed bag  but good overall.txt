 . The album starts badly with Buddy and Julie Miller proving they can't get close to the electrifying original of 'Paper Thin'. The title track is another let down, and Buddy Guy's 'Feels Like Rain' fails to live up to Hiatt's own version. Can't blame them all for trying though. Bonnie Raitt's stonking remake of 'Thing Called Love' is so good you can forgive its inclusion while wishing that more of the album was Hiatt's obscurer songs like Patty Griffin's lovely 'Take it Down' and Roseanne Cash's 'This is the Way We Make a Broken Heart'. Hiatt's well-known songs are well-known because he did such a great version. Trying to improve on them is a waste of time, though Rodney Crowell has a good stab at it on 'She Loves the Jerk'. It's an interesting album for Hiatt fans, but one that will probably have them backtracking to the originals to hear the songs done properly, for the most part.
