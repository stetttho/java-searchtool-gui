 I remember listening to this for the first time and being puzzled because there weren't any "tunes". Well, I was wrong about that of course, but you do need to listen a few times before you hear them. Some songs like the title track, sound a bit clunky at first, and to be honest, never quite lose it. And Man in the Mirror/Below the surface is just a throw away - two half-songs strung together to no great effect. BUT the rest is fine. Old Tnnessee is a classic DF track, Crow is pleasingly spooky and The Last Nail the best song on the album, and a good place to finish.
