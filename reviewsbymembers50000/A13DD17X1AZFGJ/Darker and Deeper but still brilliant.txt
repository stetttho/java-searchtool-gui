 Star rating should be 5/5. I can't edit it. I hated this when I first got it. I thought it was depressing. But KJP, more than just about anyone else, needs an awful lot of listening to. I'd come to it after getting into the remarkable blues style of 'Shine eyed Mister Zen' and this was very different. Here we have a full band and a less extreme guitar style. It's earthier, darker, louder. but not really loud, of course. You'll get used to it! The right elements are there: 'hard' poetry, subtle melodies, weird imagery, and that voice. What I realise, after listening to him for a couple of years, and seeing him perform on stage, is that he has an unerringly tuneful voice. Gravelly, smoky, yes, but never a bum note. His voice is superbly musical. It took me ages to see this album properly, separate out the elements. There are definitely some classics in here, like 'Beggar's Oil', 'Tommy' and the wonderful 'Fleashine'. The band works pretty well with Kelly Joe, producing some nice gritty blues as well as more gentle sounds. But they leave the master guitarist to accompany himself alone for the final track, a whimsical tune for a change. If you buy this, and I think you should, you'll just have to put the work in. But Kelly Joe Phelps remains one of the most important artists around with this album.
