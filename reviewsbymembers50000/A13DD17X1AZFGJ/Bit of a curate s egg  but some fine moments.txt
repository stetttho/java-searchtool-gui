 There are three Nanci Griffiths on A CLOCK WITHOUT HANDS. There's the smooth, wise, mature professional on the title track with its laid back groove and clever lyric. A good, classic Nanci song. She's there on the superb cover of Paul Carrack's "Where Would I Be", my favourite track. Just love the bass on this one, and Nanci's vocals are just perfect. A class act. That Nanci is there on a couple more too. Then there's the good old Nanci we know and kind of love, belting out the chorus on "Lost Him in the Sun", which is catchy, but perhaps a bit unsubtle and JUST MAYBE a song you would grow tired of in the future. "Pearl's Eye View (the Life of Dickey Chapelle)" falls into this category too. This is also the Nanci whose sincerity can grate a bit. I guess we might be calling this the "Vietnam" album. Still, it could be worse. At least the Crickets are nowhere to be seen. And then of course there's the Nanci who suddenly turns into Kermit the Frog, singing "Halfway up the Stairs". So for that, I retract my 4 star rating and make it three and a half instead. This is the worst Nanci, and the one I'd like to banish forever. There she is on "Truly something Fine" which is truly something toe curling, and on "Cotton". I wonder too, how long I'll be able to take that strangely tortured delivery on "Shaking Out the Snow". Especialy when the final track is beckoning: a lovely version of "In the Wee Small Hours" which makes me long for a whole album of songs just like that. I'm thinking that here is a Nanci Griffith album with the usual disappointments, but there are moments when I like her voice more than I ever have, and there's a sound she's getting at that could turn into something amazing, if she could just be the first Nanci for a whole CD.
