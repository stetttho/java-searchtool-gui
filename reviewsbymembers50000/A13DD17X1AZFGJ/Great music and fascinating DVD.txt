 Living as I do in the UK, I've never had the chance to see Greg Brown 'live', so I was keen to get this DVD and CD combination. The DVD is very interesting. Greg, who comes across as very warm and intelligent, is interviewed throughout, and there are 'live' performances and nice scenes with Greg's folks back in his home town of Hacklebarney. You really get a feel for where 'Greg Brown' came from, and where he still is in a way, something that must be the key to his success and longevity as an artist. He's unspoiled. The CD is crammed full of some of Greg's greatest songs from the past few years. They need a bit of listening to before you realise just how good they are, but instantly obvious is Greg's unique style and the humour in his unique voice. What's interesting, seeing the background in the DVD, is how he has kept to his roots while at the same time creating music that's universal and whose themes go beyond the 'down home'. This is really well worth getting.
