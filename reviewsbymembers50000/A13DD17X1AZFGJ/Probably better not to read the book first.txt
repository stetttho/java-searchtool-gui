 Well, this is a very enjoyable film, but when you get home you'll start picking holes in it. The biggest hole by far is Michael Douglas. Having read the book, to me he plays the character of Grady all wrong. He's too "Michael Douglas" for a start, overdoes the cute comedy act, looks just too unappealing for us to believe that the Chancellor could be interested in him. And there are clumsy moments, like when the book falls out of the car, and scenes that are electrifying in the novel and thrown away in the film. They even missed out one of the best sequences... Robert Downey Jr is excellent though, and the interplay between him and the James Leer character is very well done. And the Pittsburgh backdrop is atmospheric and a bit different. Just about worth it.
