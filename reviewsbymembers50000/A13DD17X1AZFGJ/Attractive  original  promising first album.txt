 Garrin has a really great voice: strong and clear and extremely appealing. That much is obvious right from the first listen. I wasn't sure how much I liked it beyond that, but now I can hardly prise the CD from my player. I thought at first maybe some of the melodies were a little unresolved, but now I think they're just subtle. It's surprising how they start to go around your head, especially a song like "Walking" that turns out to be a very strong and affecting track. And now that I'm starting to make something of the words as well as the music, the whole album is coming into focus nicely. So, if you get it, take the time because it's worth it. Appreciate how cleverly put together and beautifully produced the whole album is; there's real care taken here. This guy is something new and good and original and exciting; I think he could be destined for great things.
