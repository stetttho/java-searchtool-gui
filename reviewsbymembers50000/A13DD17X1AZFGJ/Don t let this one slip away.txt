 This is one of the best albums I own. It's truly bizarre that Jimmie Spheeris, despite the fact that he's, well, dead, is so obscure. Nobody's ever heard of him. And yet he's a great songwriter and a great singer, standing comparison with any of his peers in the mid 1970s, like Jackson Browne (who sings backing vocals on this CD) or Joni Mitchell. The combination of Jimmie's voice and his incredible ear for melody makes this one of the few albums that can actually make my hair stand on end when I listen to it. His voice really is unique: effortlessly musical, whether soft edged and gentle, or extended with the trademark `edge' that makes him so compelling to listen to. Most songs here are originals, with `Bayou Eyes' and `The Whirlpool' particularly good, but no track less than excellent. Some of these songs stop you in your tracks. I'm a great fan too of his versions of the 1950s song `It's All in the Game', which is far better than anybody else's. And he does a memorable version of Hank Williams' classic `I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry' to round of an album you'll want to listen to again immediately when it's over. It's criminal this is so obscure and hard to get. But at least you can still just about get it. I'd be quick though if I were you. At least a certain online music download service has most of his albums if you can't stomach the cost of the CDs here. You know which one!
