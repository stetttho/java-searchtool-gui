 This was not only one of Dan's most commercially successful albums, spawning a couple of hit singles ("Longer" reached No.2) , it also happens to be one of his best albums. "Longer" I suspect must be regarded as one of the weaker songs on the album, despite its fame as Dan's highest charting single ever. I prefer the gentle, lilting "Gypsy Wind" and the catchy "Last to Know". Interesting melodies abound on the album, the hallmark of Dan's early work, and his soaring vocals and close harmonies are used to excellent effect. From simple songs like "Along the Road" to the more ambitious "Wishing on the Moon", the songs on "Phoenix" gel together into a fine whole, with perhaps only the rather forced conscience of "Face the Fire" grating. If you were to get only one Fogelberg album you could do much worse than this one.
