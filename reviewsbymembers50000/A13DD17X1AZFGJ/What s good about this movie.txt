 That's a hard one to answer. I did smile once or twice, but even Barbra's most ardent fans will struggle to like this lame effort. The trouble is that there's nothing clever about it. So anybody who likes 'What's Up, Doc?' and thinks, Great, another Streisand/O'Neal movie I will enjoy, well, think again. Ryan O'Neal tries to be cute, but it looks like it's hard for him. Barbra's character is confusing: she starts as a high-powered business woman, but later in the film slips into 'vulnerable silly woman' character half the time. What's going on? And do we need another movie with endless scenes of boxing? No doubt they needed something to fill up the empty spaces in the plot, between the embarrassing 'that would NEVER happen' bits that spoil so much comedy. So what's good about this movie? Well, if you like Barbra Streisand, you get to see her, albeit with probably her worst ever hairdo. If it was anybody else, I'd give this one star, and grudgingly.
