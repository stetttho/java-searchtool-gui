 . I didn't think I'd be giving a new Dan Fogelberg album five stars again. But I've got to hand it to him - this is a really good album whichever way you look at it. I'm sure all his fans will love it just because it exists, but I think it's a bit better than that and deserves attention from a wider audience. First, it's the best produced Fogelberg album of all. It is full of lovely acoustic guitars, intricate embellishments and manages to sound crisp and new while harking back to happier Fogelberg times too.  It's more than thirty years since the first DF album, and Dan's voice has changed quite a lot. The surprise is that he sounds perhaps sweeter and more appealing now than he ever has. On `Full Circle' the thing that strikes you is the beauty of his phrasing and the simplicity of his vocal delivery. His previous tendency to `over-sing' a song has gone, and it's refreshing. There are several very good songs on `Full Circle' and really none that make you want to hit the skip button. The title track is an excellent cover of The Byrds' song from thirty years ago, a strong song that fits in here perfectly, it seems like Dan wrote it himself. All but two songs are DF originals, from the haunting and beautiful `Whispers in the Wind' to the perfectly-formed `Reach Haven Postcard', and all are good or better than good, with strong melodies and wise, poetic lyrics. It's the softer songs that sound best, complete with Dan's trademark harmonies, and fans of Dan's earlier work will be ecstatic when they hear these. This is by far the best Dan Fogelberg album for many years, and it might even stand comparison with his very best. Time will tell, but highly recommended for here and now.
