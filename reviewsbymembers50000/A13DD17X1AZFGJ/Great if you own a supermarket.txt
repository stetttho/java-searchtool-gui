 One for Fogelberg ompletists only, I think. The instrumental stuff really is just muzak, and pretty pointless. Dan does quite a nice job of some of the sixties songs - if he got rid of the flute and the electronic drums,  there could be quite a nice album of covers in it for him. No resemblance  whatsoever to a great album. Sorry.
