 Really, this is two stories made into one novel. I would like to be able to say that you can hardly see the join, but well, you can. One story will be strangely familiar to those who have already read Fry's delightful MOAB IS MY WASHPOT: cleverclogs schoolboy outwits teachers, falls into his own bad company but saves himself from the mire in the end to become a great success. It's the Stephen Fry story. The other is a spy story, or so it appears, which presumably has nothing to do with the real Stephen Fry. Fry teases us throughout with the spy story, inserting bits of it here and there in between the schoolboy stuff. He further tests us by jumbling the order of the schoolboy story, which is on the whole cleverly done. It means that you're constantly trying to guess why this or that is significant. It works. But I found the transition from schoolboy to spy an awkward and tenuous one. It depends on a big lie to the reader (or at least a big omission) that seems unfair, and not at all satisfying. The quality of the writing fades too in the second part. Adrian changes from the impossibly witty to something quite dull; he is puzzlingly upstaged and it doesn't quite add up. And yet, and yet... The novel overcomes its difficulties and you more or less forgive it. Because it really is laugh-out-loud funny, and a true page-turner. The main character may be disgustingly clever, but there's enough humility and vulnerability for you to fall for him hook line and sinker. And even the spy story has twists enough to guarantee you'll get right to the slightly obvious ending in no time at all.
