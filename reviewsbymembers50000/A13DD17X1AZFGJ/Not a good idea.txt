 As others have commented, teaming up the musicians responsible for John Hiatt's 1987 masterpiece, "Bring the Family" must have seemed like a good idea, but it wasn't. The difference is that this time the others get to write and sing. Seems pretty obvious to me that it wouldn't work; "Bring the Family" is so good because it's a JOHN HIATT album. This album doesn't even work when the song is obviously Hiatt penned, because he's trying to be Little Village, not John Hiatt. I don't think a single song on here is memorable, except for its dullness. When Hiatt is singing, it's just about worth the effort of putting it in the player, but otherwise... not a good idea.
