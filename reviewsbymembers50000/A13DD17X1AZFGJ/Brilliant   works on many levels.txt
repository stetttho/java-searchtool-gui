 I've been through several stages with this album, which if nothing else reveals that it's possible to interpret many of its songs in different ways. Least comfortable for me was the suspicion that this was a sneaky attempt to force a religious message on me, by dressing up spiritual thoughts as love songs. And then I heard an interview with Darden that put a different slant on things. He revealed that "Shadow" is about the darker side of himself that he's found a way to accept, and when you know this, it makes sense. If there's a message in "Sunflower", it's that you can see the beauty in things if you put your mind to it, and that this has the potential to change your life. If that sounds trite, it's not the way it comes over in the songs, and "Easier Said Than Done" explicitly explores the difficulties of living out the message very neatly. "New Gospel" on the other hand, perhaps the most curious song on the album, uses all the language of religion, in an almost irreverent way, to "preach" the idea. Novel. None of this would be any good though if "Sunflower" was musically substandard, and I'm happy to report that it is anything but. In fact, it is nothing short of miraculous. Take a song like "Stronger". It's a defiant song about getting over a relationship, with an almost gleeful background of distorted guitars, very subtle, but rising like a cry of freedom rises in the throat. That's typical of the way these songs are punctuated musically. There's evidence of it all over the album, like the playful piano "full-stop" that marks the end of "Stronger" and the geometric rhythms of the beautiful "Perfect Moment", one of my favourite tracks. As always, Darden's lyrics are faultless, and his vocals softer and more seductive than ever. It's a distinctive, beautifully produced album that can stop you in your tracks. I haven't heard a better album this century...
