 Paul Thorn's subsequent CDs have made me see this in a different light. There's no doubt he's talented, and very entertaining, but in a kind of home grown way, not a polished, produced to the hilt way. So it's weird when you go back to Hammer and Nail and hear Paul acting so serious, with high, yet not particularly nice, production values. It doesn't seem right. It seems artificial. And yet, there are some great songs here that I can't imagine Paul Thorn could've done justice to without the upscale production on this album. So it's a bit of a conundrum. It's not that it sounds phoney, but... there's just some quality about this that I can't put my finger on that stops me being totally involved. Best song on the album though is the stripped down 'Temporarily Forever Mine', which rises above the production. 'Sure Sign' is pretty distinctive too, and 'I Bet He Knows' is darn catchy. Nice gravelly/smoky quality to Paul's vocals too.
