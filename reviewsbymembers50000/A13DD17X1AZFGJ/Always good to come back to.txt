 Ten real songs. Not one of them a let down, not one substandard. Each one different, unique, full of its own particular pleasures. Whether it's the delicate harmonies of Darden and Nanci Griffith's voices on the moving "Love Me Like a Soldier", the catchy, upbeat "Want You By My Side", or the curious dance hall feel of "Little Maggie", each is strong on melody and has a lyric that will catch your ear too. This is the most "country" of all of Darden's albums and if you haven't yet experienced his music, this is a great place to start. He has a uniquely appealing voice and turn of phrase, and writes some of the subtlest, most memorable tunes around.
