 It's been a while since we've had new songs from David Gates. There are four new songs on this album, and a newly recorded (and inferior I think) version of "Love is Always Seventeen". The new songs are okay, but don't come close to the classic songs. Probably too much of the rest is made up of the Bread classics that any Bread and David Gates fan will already own. And for a "definitive" collection, it's a major surprise that there's not a single track from the "Falling in Love Again" album, a much better album than "Take Me Now", from which there is a solitary track. So it's an album of great music, undeniably (new songs excepted if we're being honest) but an album that seems to me to be out of balance. If you really want to hear those new songs, I guess you'll be buying it, but considering the price, you may be better off buying a couple of other Bread/Gates CDs, and you'll get most of what's on here.
