 Kate Campbell doesn't have a particularly rich or mellow voice, but it's an interesting one, and I liked her turn of phrase. She writes about odd things too: witness "Bowl-O-Rama", and "Jesus and Tomatoes". Not the only song about food, this reminded me momentarily of Guy Clark and his Homegrown Tomatoes. But, oddball as these subjects are, and humorous in their own way, they're not out and out humorous songs. This is, on the whole, a more serious album. We see it in the political comment she makes in the powerful "Crazy in Alabama" and the sharp memories of "Bus 109". I find I play this CD when I'm in a "serious listening" mood, because it does demand your atention somewhat. It isn't background music. I was a little surprised at that. I think I expected something more laid back, but much of the album is uptempo and demands to be played loud. It's saying "listen to me properly." If you do, I think you'll grow to like it. And if you're a fan of Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt, you're almost certain to like it.
