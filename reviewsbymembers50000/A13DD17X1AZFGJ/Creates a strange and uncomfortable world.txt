 Like all Rupert Thomson's settings, the (almost) inescapable village in this novel is strange not because it is alien but precisely because it is so familiar. And yet, things aren't quite right. This village is run by the tyrannical Inspector Peach with his macabre little police museum and his cardboard policemen to scare would-be leavers. As so often in Thomson's novels, this is a story in two parts. Moses, the child, does escape, to an equally familiar and unfamiliar city where he finds his place at a triangular pink night club... All very weird, but compelling, and only a bit first-novel-ish. Recommended if you like to be made uncomfortable by a slight twisting of normality.
