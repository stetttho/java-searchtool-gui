 I love the title track of this album with its fantastic guitar prelude. This is another rather "electronic" sounding Fogelberg album and a rather belated jump onto the world rythms bandwagon. It's not a bad album but there are no really great songs on here and it leaves you wishing that Dan would use his 2 great strengths - his voice and his acoustic guitar - to come up with something a little more natural. Dan Fogelberg doesn't need a drum machine and he's not ttrying to go platinum these days.
