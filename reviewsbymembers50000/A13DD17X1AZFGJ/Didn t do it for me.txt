 . I liked Rodney Crowell's last album very much and bought this on the strength of it. Sadly, Fate's Right Hand doesn't have the clever, complex, folky feel of The Houston Kid. Navel-gazing is the theme of the album, and it's all the worse for it. Crowell takes self-deprecation to a new and disturbing level; I cringed at some of the lyrics in these songs. The lyrics and the themes behind them seemed to me to be weakly conceived, half-hearted even. I didn't buy the cloying sincerity. Musically it is straightforward and I thought, rather monotonous: repetive choruses, endless lists of things half-cleverly put together, and the kind of noisy country rhythm that drives you mad after half a CD. It was quite shocking to find not one song that I liked - in total contrast to Crowell's previous effort. I'm puzzled by the change. And disappointed.
