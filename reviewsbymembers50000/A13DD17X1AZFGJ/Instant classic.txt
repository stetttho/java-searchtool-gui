 While Josh Ritter's newest album is a little more polished perhaps (on the surface), this one is every bit as good. JR's songs are like paintings, full of detail and atmosphere; they're fabulous from across the room, but you see all kinds of things when you get up close and intimate. And he makes it seem so ridiculously easy: a stroke here and there and he's conjured up a whole scene. How does he do that? I think he writes some of the best lyrics in contemporary folk music; he's right up there with the established greats, I reckon - a natural; he makes you feel so at home with his good-natured vocals, always underplayed and subtle. There's an infectious warmth to his music that makes you listen over and over. I can't be the only person waiting with baited breath for the next album.
