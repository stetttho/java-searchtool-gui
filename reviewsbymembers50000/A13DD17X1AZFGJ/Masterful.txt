 This is deep, subtle, intelligent stuff. You'll need to listen over and over again, but you'll want to; it just gets better and better. This album really is a case of less is more. I love the fact that there doesn't have  to be a selection of up-tempo tracks, doesn't have to be drums, doesn't  have to be anything but great songs and the sparest - yet solid and  rhythmic - musical setting. Greg Brown's voice is the icing on the cake.  You need to buy this.
