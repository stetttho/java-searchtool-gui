 If every song had been of the quality of In the Bleak Midwinter, I would have given this 5 stars. That song is done beautifully, no argument. In fact it has an almost eerie quality to it, creating an atmosphere all it's  own. I've never heard it done so well. One other track is almost as good,  but then there's the rest. There are too many of those bland instrumental  pieces that we're all too familiar with from No Resemblance Whatsoever.  There's no life in them. One of the major disappointments for me is the  "formality" with which Dan sings and plays much of this music.  He's started to do funny things with vowels, like an English choir boy and  it just doesn't sound right.  Time's running out for Dan. I despair of  getting another nicely recorded acoustic album that shows off his two great  talents: his voice and his guitar. This album is a comparitive waste of  time.
