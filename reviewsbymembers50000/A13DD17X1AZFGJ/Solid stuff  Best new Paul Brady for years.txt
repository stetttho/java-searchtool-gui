 . What surprises me about this album is that there isn't a 'skip past' track. That's pretty rare. It starts off well with "Smile" - not 'though your heart is breaking', but a catchy new song that sets the nicely laid back, organic pace this new album maintains. It's good to see Paul Brady realising, like many of his contemporaries, that songs work better when you don't try quite so hard. So we have his distinctive edgy acoustic guitar, and some nice laid back grooves to back him up. What surprised me even more, since I didn't notice until the fourth spin, is that it is crammed full of melodies and phrases that I can't stop humming to myself. This is good stuff. Much better than the previous couple of albums. And different enough from the likes of 'Hard Station' so we don't need to decide if it's better or not. Bonnie Raitt makes a not unexpected apearance on backing vocals in the lively "Doin' it in the Dark". I guess my preference for music from her side of the Atlantic, and the fact that this was recorded in Nashville and is obviously influenced by the Bonnie Raitt set explains why I like it so much. It's not just the music and the sound though: I like the grown up ideas in the songs. They 'resonate' with me, if I'm being pretentious. These are songs for a thirty- or forty-something generation. One that likes really good music.
