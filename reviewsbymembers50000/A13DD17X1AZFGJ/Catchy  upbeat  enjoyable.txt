 Okay, so this will never achieve classic status like "All This and  Heaven Too", but it's well worth having if you're an Andrew Gold  fan. The surprise is just how good he still sounds after all these years.  The "country" twist suits him just fine too, though this is  hardly a country album. Standout tracks are "Sorry to Let You  Down", a Stephen Bishop-esque tune that I've been humming to myself  for days. "Can't Help Forgiving You" is another standout track  with a great guitar sound. There are a couple of duds, but with 15 songs  and a witty secret track too, who's complaining?
