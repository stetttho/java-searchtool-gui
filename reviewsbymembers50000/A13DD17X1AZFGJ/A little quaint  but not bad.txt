 I bought this out of curiosity after hearing Don McLean's very good new album of songs by Marty Robbins. I think Don McLean's versions are improvements on these, but that's not fair since many of the tracks on this album were recorded in mono in the 1950s, and are very much period pieces. Plenty of well known songs here, many penned by Robbins, like the classic "El Paso". The spinoff songs from that are pretty weak though. Songs by others include "Singing the Blues" and Hal David and Burt Bacharach's cute "The Story of My Life". Hank Williams' "Kaw Liga" is another amusing but catchy song that stands out. Disc one is the best, and really quite a jolly listen. The later years are less good, less original, less fun.
