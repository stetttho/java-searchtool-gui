 I see this as one of McEwan's lesser novels. The story is fairly slender, and the ending rather unsatisfying. The characters, mainly politicians and journalists, are rather lifeless too. Whenever I see the grey cover of my UK hardback edition, it seems to echo the contents... But only relatively speaking. After "Enduring Love", what can we expect? In truth, "Amsterdam" is neat and enjoyable, but doesn't have the deliciously shocking moments we've come to expect from McEwan. "Black Dogs" was similarly low key. I'm glad I bought it, but I wouldn't like to think that this is what we can expect from Ian McEwan from from now on. I'm sure it isn't!
