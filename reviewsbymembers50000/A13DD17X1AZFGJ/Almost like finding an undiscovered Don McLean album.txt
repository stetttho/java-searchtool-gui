 The FAVOURITES disc is as you'd expect, so treat it like any other BEST OF. Except, that the sound quality, particularly on the American Pie tracks, is better than I've ever heard before. The RARITIES disc is well worth having. There are quite a few excellent tracks that never made it to the albums, but were pretty good anyway. You can have fun spotting which session they came from. There are other bits too, live bits, and tiny clips. I'd almost say, though, that it's worth getting the whole thing for just one track: Good Old Wagon. Why this track has been gathering dust for all these years is a mystery. I love it! This is a great double CD. The bonus is the extensive notes about each track.
