 There's a kind of polished metal feel to this one which comes from the playing and production. It's a bit too clean and sharp for me, not at all like Slow Turning for instance. Solid songs, great vocals... but still it  just misses the mark and is overshadowed by the great Hiatt albums starting  with Riding With the King. A good one to test how loud your hi-fi will go!
