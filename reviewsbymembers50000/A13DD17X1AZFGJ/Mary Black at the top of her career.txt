 As it turns out, when Mary left behind the talents of Noel Brazil (the songwriter) and Declan Sinnot (the guitarist and producer) things went downhill somewhat. But here they are on this album, so it's the most likeable form Mary Black comes in, if not entirely satisfying. Brazil's songs are certainly unique, like Jimmy McCarthy's contribution on the CD, but don't always hit the mark. Golden Mile, though, is excellent, with great atmosphere and timing. Suits Mary's voice perfectly. Likewise Bright Blue Rose, which has a similar ethereal quality. Nice subtle arrangements and haunting harmonies. The title track is a curious Brazil song: it has the feel of a number from a stage musical that gives it a falsely dramatic effect. Adam At TheWindow (MacCarthy) is similarly overblown and ultimately meaningless. These are the sort of songs that have weakened Mary Black's albums through the years. But it's worth getting the album for Kieran Goss's catchy Brand New Star, the classic Thorn Upon the Rose, and an excellent cover of Richard Thompson's Dimming of the Day. Often used by hi-fi reviewers, the CD has a lovely deep, pure quality of sound. Only a few weak songs let it down a bit.
