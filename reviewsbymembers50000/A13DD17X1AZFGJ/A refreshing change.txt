 Mark Weigle deserves 5 stars just for doing this album. Male singers in this genre just haven't represented the gay audience; this album is such a pleasant surprise. It's also a pleasant surprise that it's so well produced  with a nice sensitive sound that highlights the acoustic guitars and Mark's  very appealing voice. I reserve the fifth star, I hope, for his next album.  This time around, I can;t help but feel that the album lacks just a little  bit, lyrically, is a little too obvious in places. But ignore that. Just  put Two Cowboy Waltz on and imagine the good things to come.
