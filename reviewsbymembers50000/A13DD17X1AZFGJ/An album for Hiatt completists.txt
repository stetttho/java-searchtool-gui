 This is the one that nearly got away. One can't help feeling that there are some good songs here; they're just hidden by the production which comes over brash and overdone. The album seems to rush itself somehow with only  My Edge of the Razor as a change of pace. Still, it has a certain charm but  is probably for serious Hiatt fans only.
