 I felt like I was watching an amateur production of a minor, and long-forgotten play. I couldn't quite make up my mind if the cast were just incompetent, or the script was letting them down very badly. Probably both. Some of Helen Hunt's lines fell so flat I cringed for her. The interaction between her and Woody was possibly the least convincing bit of acting I've seen in a long time. I'm amazed he dare release it. Worse, the plot is utterly peurile and full of holes you could drive a truck through. And it isn't funny, except for a couple of minor gags. It makes "Small Time Crooks" look like a masterpiece.
