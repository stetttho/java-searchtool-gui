 ... and don't we get to hear about it. Gorka takes his subjects a bit too literally for those who don't want to know too much about the man himself. But there are some decent songs on this album - January Floor for instance  is light and catchy, just right. Poduction on this album is noticably more  in your face than usual and none the better for it. It's also a bit too  obvious that some of the percusion was put on afterwards. Not a bad effort,  but the last one was better and the one before better still. Careful now Mr  Gorka.
