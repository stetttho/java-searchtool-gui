 I've had my iMac for about 10 months now, after switching from PC land. Panther didn't take any geting used to at all to be honest. The reason is that it's so well laid out in the first place. Unlike Windows, you never seem to have to be burrowing down into the depths of the system to change some little thing. Everything's right there, and once you set it, stays set! Microsoft please note.  The system has crashed just once so far, when I tried a game CD frm a magazine cover. Apart from that, it's remarkably stable, and I've grown used to having lots of apps open at the same time and not worrying, even if I'm burning a CD or something.  At first my thought was that there isn't much to play with, not much to set, and that's pretty much the way it seems. There isn't. You just get on with it.  I love the way the finder works (especially in column view), with the left hand column for often used apps or folders that makes it so easy to move things around or burn disks.  I like the delayable voice reminders that shout me in from the kitchen when the next stage of a download needs attending to or something.  I love the razor sharp graphics, the way everything slides so smoothly around the screen. Expose, for instance, is amazing, especially if you have loads of windows open, which you get into the habit of doing.
