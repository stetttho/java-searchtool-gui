 Not really my kind of book this, but I won't get snobby about it. There are times when something light and fluffy is all your mind can take. And for those times, you can't do much better than this. It has the air of an extended magazine article, but thankfully, one that's very well done, very sharp, really quite appealing. I think it helps to be able to identify with the main character, so if you're one of those serious "my finances are all in order thank you" kind of people, you probably won't find this funny. But if you are occasionally, or often, overtaken by the desire to shop, and if you're a specialist in justifying it to yourself, you'll find it hilarious.
