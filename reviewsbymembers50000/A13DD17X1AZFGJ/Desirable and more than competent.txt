 I spent a while looking for the right P&S camera. Most on the market today have horrible delayed-action shutter releases. This one reacts instantly. So on that score alone it's worth the money for me. No more missed action shots! Plus, it's extremely stylish and well made, with an aluminium front casing and stainless steel lens surround. And it feels "chunkier" than other cameras of this type. The "Best shot" dial is by far the best system of changing modes I've used , and I like the ability to customize one of the modes. The spot metering mode is useful to have. The pictures I've got from the camera so far have been uniformly well-exposed and in focus. Even shots taken at full zoom in low light were crisp. Colours seem to be particularly good, and the red-eye reduction works much better than my previous camera.
