 Dan Fogelberg deals with all the phases of life in his epic `song cycle', and is perhaps being a little `worthy' in the process. But don't let that put you off. It also contains some of Dan's best songs. Some of them were big hits, like `Leader of the Band', `Hard to Say' and `Run For the Roses' - all memorable. Some of them are just great songs, like `The Sand and the Foam' and `Only the Heart May Know' (with Emmylou Harris in a haunting duet). It's the usual late seventies sound from Dan, which means lush arrangements, Dan playing lots of different instruments, but with an emphasis on acoustic guitar, and Dan's high-reaching harmonies. Songs range from the gentle ballads to out and out rockers, but with much in between. Always very musical, Dan's perfect pitch stands out on the quieter tracks - `Leader of the Band' in particular. It's a bit of a sentimental journey through life. Stories of dead fathers and young horses growing up abound. The uniqueness of the songs mean that Dan managed to turn these unlikely subjects into his biggest hits ever. So it's an album that's better than you might think from the telling. And an essential one for Dan Fogelberg fans. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
