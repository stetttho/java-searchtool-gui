 It's almost impossible to imagine how Bonnie could go this low and then spring back with something so perfect (or apt) as Nick of Time. One can only assume that it wasn't her fault. There's not much to recommend this  album; it's so bland, flat and anonymous it could be by anybody. Bonnie's  worst by a mile.
