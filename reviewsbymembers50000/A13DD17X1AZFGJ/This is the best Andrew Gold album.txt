 I was so glad to find this album on CD at last. Along with my Stephen Bishop and David Gates albums, this was one of the records I played non-stop for years in the 1970's. Songs like HOW CAN THIS BE LOVE, NEVER LET HER SLIP AWAY and THANK YOU FOR BEING A FRIEND are rightly famous now, and the rest of the album, happily, stands comparison with those songs. Some are better. Andrew Gold is great at writing catchy tunes with catchy lyrics, and never more successful than here, I reckon. These songs will stay with you for a long time. If you were lucky enough to hear them back when the album came out, prepare yourself for a delightful nostalgia trip. If not, you may be impressed at how solid these songs still sound. This album is a true classic.
