 I don't know if you would "get" this if you weren't interested in graphic design in some way. It's a novel of ideas, about graphic design. Perhaps the story comes off second best here, but it's engaging enough. The teacher is the main character, and it's the chapters that deal with his teaching that make this novel worth reading. Anyone who's been in higher education will thrill at the challenges he sets his students and the ways they overcome them. Those chapters are superb, the sort of writing that you rip through in no time, the sort of writing that keeps you up till the early hours of the morning if you're not careful. Delicious in places. Get the hardback edition and you can spend a happy half hour just looking at it too. Well worth accepting the minor limitations of this novel for the pleasure it gives.
