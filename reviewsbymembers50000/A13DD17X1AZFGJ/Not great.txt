 Really quite liked Mark's first and second albums, but this one doesn't do it for me. Why? It's the songs I think. They're either depressing, a little embarrassing, or just boring. It isn't enough, on the third album, to still be working out all those past hurts so explicitly. It comes over as whining, not confession. It's not universal. And when Mark does attempt to be upbeat, he borders on the trite. I found it really hard to pick out much of a melody in most of the songs on this album - they just kind of drift along aimlessly. I'm sure he's a fun guy to see live. It's not so much fun to sit and listen to this CD.
