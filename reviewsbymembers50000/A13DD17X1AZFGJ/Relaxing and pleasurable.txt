 Accept first that this is an album of covers from someone who's a singer and no more. Then enjoy. Some of the songs here are a little obscure, but you'll know most of 'em, and Cam has chosen pretty well. He hasn't gone overboard with the gender-swapping, so thankfully it doesn't seem like it was the whole point of the project. But it's there, and it's nice to hear him sing "Something in the way he moves", and others, where the object of the song is a man. I have to say that you soon get used to that though, and happily, this remains an attractive album when you do. Cam's voice is central to this, and he's got a warm, smoky, deep voice and a nice sense of phrasing that's very masculine, and soothing at the same time. One or two of the songs (like "Jesse") sound cloying and too sentimental, but in general there's a good mixture. If "I Will Survive" seems like it's far too corny to be on here, have a listen, because it's not the version you'll be used to. In many ways, it's my favourite track because he's had to do something entirely different with it. Okay, it's not the greatest work of art, but there will be times when it fits the bill. Play it to your unsuspecting straight friends and watch their faces!
