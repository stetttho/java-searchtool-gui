 This is Garrin's second album. It's a much stronger, more cohesive effort than his first, though that was pretty good. But he's learned a lot since then, clearly. "Nowhere Is Brighter" shows a breadth of ability that "Living a Dream" just hinted at. Key to this is a faultless foundation, courtesy of Bonnie Raitt's rhythm section - much has been made of this. But don't get the impression that they do all the work. The songs are Garrin's, he's a great singer, and a terrific guitarist. Lots of styles: from the understated pop of "What to Listen For", through the bouncy near reggae of "To Know", rock'n'roll ("Crazy Love"), blues ("The Sense That I Get") and folky tunes like "Leg". All are handled with equal confidence. Garrin has a strong, clear, steady voice that reminds me most perhaps of Jackson Browne. And he's good at writing tunes with hooks that have you humming them in the shower within a couple of listens. What's clever is the way that he includes gay themes without making an issue out of them, without them really becoming "gay themes". So I don't class him as a "gay songwriter" like Mark Weigle, for instance. The appeal of this album is much more universal, and subtle. You can take from these songs what you need. Sound quality, by the way, is first class all through. This is no budget production - look at the star cast! Roll on the third album.
