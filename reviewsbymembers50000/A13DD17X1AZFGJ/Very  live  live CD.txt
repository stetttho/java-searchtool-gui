 Other reviewers comment on the renditions of classic songs being a little different. Well, that's the whole point of a "live" record, surely. If you want to hear the original studio versions, buy the studio  albums. This, on the other hand, gives you a moment in time, a snapshot  of Don McLean at his best. And there are several songs you won't find on  his studio albums. There's also a great performer-audience thing going on  that's better than on his other live cut. Babylon, when he divides up the  audience and gets them to sing in parts, is quite something.
