 This has a crisp jaunty feel to it with nice production. My favourite Brady album, it sits nicely between his earlier,  slightly less approachable efforts and his later, blander (ie. mainstream) albums. Deep  in Your Heart is one of the stand out songs with Eric Clapton on electric  guitar. Paul Brady's voice is strong and unique and he has an interesting  turn of phrase. Once described as 1987's "most  attractive"  album.
