 Instead of looking for reasons why this latest offering from Bonnie isn't as good as "Nick of Time" or whatever other album from Bonnie's illustrious career, better to appreciate it for what it is. What it is, is a thoroughly enjoyable album with the familiar mix of styles we've come to expect, Bonnie's great vocals, and a band that's so good you could hardly imagine bettering them. The only comparison I'm going to make with earlier albums is that it takes a bit of listening to; you have to do some work. If you do, the songs (most of 'em) blossom into the kind you can listen to many times and not get tired of. There's no defining track on this album, true, but perhaps, a bit like a movie without a major star, it helps the balance of the thing, makes you appreciate the whole, rather than this part or that part. It seems to me, as it grows on me, that it's a good, rounded album with no glaring weaknesses or filler tracks that you'd skip if you could be bothered. Even my least favourites are still okay. I'm impressed particularly by songs like "I Can't Help You Now" which is a clever, understated, well done song. And the blues tracks (we get two this time around) are always a treat, just like when Bonnie gets soulful on the closing track, a terrific version of Jude Johnson's "Wounded Heart". After all these years, we still get something this good from Bonnie... That's pretty amazing. It's not "Nick of Time", but it's still a must-have for any Bonnie fan.
