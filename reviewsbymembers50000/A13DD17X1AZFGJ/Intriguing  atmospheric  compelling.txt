 This is a fairly straightforward story: an elderly couple are brutally murdered, and through sheer determination, and a bit of good luck, the police, headed by the central character Kurt Wallander, solve the crime. As you'd expect. It's well done though, in a Scandinavian sort of way. It's not just that the action takes place in and around Ystad in Sweden. There's a definite feeling of Scandinavian calm about the novel, despite the subject matter. And also a suggestion of the often supposed, though rarely true in my experience, Scandinavian seriousness, graveness, literalness, whatever. Some of that may be down to the translation. At times the writing has an almost childlike quality to it; or perhaps it's just a "matter-of-fact-ness". It's not unappealing. What Mankell is good at is making you feel the chilly Swedish landscape. Ever-threatening is the weather, closing around the police as they close around the killers. It's like the elements are in league with the criminals sometimes, and it gives the book quite a creepy feeling. Mankell doesn't pay much attention to the other characters in the book; Wallander is the main man. But Wallander's crumbling personal life is described quite well, and threatens to derail his life constantly. The way he pulls through the problems of the murders, the weather and his personal life, to succeed, is perhaps the central attraction and theme of Faceless Killers. A good read. And quite an easy read. But nonetheless satisfying.
