 Anyone who, like me, treasures DonMcLean's earlier albums will be disappointed with this one. The songs here range from the humdrum title track to the cutesy Little Cowboy, an indulgent ditty from a songwriter who  seems to have lost all his edge. McLean seems to have forgotten how to  write poetry - lyrically this album borders too often on the trite and  musically it is devoid of originality.
