 I bought this record when it was released and thought at first that it was a bit lightweight (especially after Walk On). BUT, a few years down the road and I now rate it as one of his very best. There really isn't a bad  song on here, and there are several great ones. Sure Pinnocchio is superb,  and, well, so are the rest. Buy it.
