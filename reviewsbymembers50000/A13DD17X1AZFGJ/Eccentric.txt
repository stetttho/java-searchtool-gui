 Thin pickings from this increasingly eccentric artist. This is a ramshackle collection of songs, connected by leftover Vietnam themes that could usefully have ended on Nanci's last album. What's this obsession with the word Indochine? I haven't detected any particularly strong songs unfortunately, though 'I Love This Town' is catchy, and even though 'Love Conquers All' is more peculiar than most, I like its eccentricity. 'Big Blue Ball of War' though is an example of Nanci Griffith at her worst: there are several good ways to write songs about war, and this isn't one of them. I can't help feeling when I listen to this that Nanci is fading away. I hope she doesn't continue to knock albums out just for the sake of it.
