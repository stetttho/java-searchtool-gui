 There are some great songs on this album, whether it's the clever title track, the reflective When Love Begins or the manic Jump. Plenty of variety too. It's only in songs like When a Good Thing Goes Bad (prophetic perhaps)  that we see signs of McLean's impending slide into Drivelsville. Highly  recommended.
