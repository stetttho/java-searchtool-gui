 One thing you can say about John Gorka is that he's consistent. So if you liked all his previous albums you will definitely like this one. There's a typical mix of catchy tunes and slow, serious songs that I somehow never quite connected with. John's sound is what you'd expect: largely acoustic. But nonetheless distinctive. He has quite a "deliberate" style, that, along with his deep baritone, lends some of the songs a very slightly "plodding" feel. On "Edgar the Party Man" he just about manages to escape this, with a nice jauntiness. "Lighning's Blues" on the other hand, is more earthbound, the melody a little forced. In fact it's melody that is the main downfall of this album. As I sit here and look at the track listing, I realise that I just can't remember the tunes to most of these songs, and I've listened to the album many times. His previous album, "Out of the Valley", was notable for its strong melodies, but on "Between Five and Seven", he seems to have traded the previous album's appealing simplicity for something harder to get to. On the whole, not a change for the better.
