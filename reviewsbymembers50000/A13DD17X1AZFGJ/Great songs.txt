 Darden's previous album - "Little Victories" - is so close to perfection that its follow up inevitably had much to live up to. They are quite different albums in texture. the former closer to pop (smooth and cultured), the latter harder edged, less polished. If there's a problem with DFB, I don't think it's the songs. You only have to hear Darden perform the songs on stage to realise that, or check out the new versions on "Extra, Extra" which I think are so much better. Comparing them, the DFB versions sound a little "thin" and underdeveloped, while the new versions have real depth - both musically and vocally. The difference is marked. So it's the production at fault, I guess. Indeed, there are one or two songs that would benefit from a  revamp, like the raucous "Different Train", or "Skin" which would benefit from a more seductive vocal delivery. I'd love to hear both of those done again, since Darden has more recently developed his softer, more inviting style. On the other hand, one can't ignore standout tracks, and in particular, "Drowning Man" which is really quite special. It's also the only time Darden slows things down on the album, and it makes you realise that there's a lack of light and shade in general. But "Drowning Man" is a terrific song that deals, I guess, with one of Darden's recurring spiritual themes in a very moving way. "First Day of the Sun" is another superb song (again, done much better on "Extra, Extra") with a memorable lyric and a great transition into the chorus. Classic Darden Smith. On the whole, it's an album I wouldn't be without, but I do listen to it slightly frustrated that the whole package doesn't quite live up to the underlying quality of the songs.
