 There are some really good songs on this one in the Rarities section, and some of those fascinating little banjo bits that McLean likes.  It's  interesting to hear the tracks that didn't make it onto the original albums  and it looks like it wasn't necessarily because they weren't as good as the  rest.  Good Old Wagon has to be my favourite. Oddly, this track is  mentioned on the Tapestry Album cover but the track isn't on the album. It  should've been. In the favourites section, it's pretty much what you'd  expect but the sound quality is better, especially the tracks from the  American Pie album. Well worth buying if you're a fan.
