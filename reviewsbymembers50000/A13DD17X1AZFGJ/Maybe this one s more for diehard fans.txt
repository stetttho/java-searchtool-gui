 You probably already have to be a fan to appreciate this. If you're new to Lyle Lovett, start somewhere else. Then come back to this. It's a little weird in places. Some of the songs are just plain surreal, like Fat Babies, and Penguins. Others are witty, if odd, like Hello Grandma, and Creeps Like Me. Songs range from the sketch like, to the complete. They Don't Like Me, I've Got the Blues and Good-bye to Carolina are three that stand out. What this is like, is a collection of short stories by a novellist who's normally a bit more serious and wants to have a bit of fun. So if you bear that in mind when you buy it, you'll not be disappointed. The bonus is the simplicity and clarity of the recording; Lyle uses a minimum of instruments to create a very spare and focussed sound.
