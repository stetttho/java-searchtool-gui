 If a book was a moment in time, this would be an idyllic summer evening in the English countryside of bygone days. If you read Enid Blyton's Famous Five books when you were a child, you might get a little of that feeling back reading this book. The castle, the eccentric family, the exotic American interlopers, the "bear", the steam trains, the thrilling moments of luxury and indulgence, tea with the vicar, fulfilment... it all reminds me of those times. It's simply enchanting.
