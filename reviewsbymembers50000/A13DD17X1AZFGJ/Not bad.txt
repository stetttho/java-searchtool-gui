 Dan tries some very mainstream rock and pop on "Exiles" and on the whole doesn't do too bad a job of it. Whether or not this album will stand comparison with earlier work over time is another matter. The production dates this album, in both senses of the word. Just listen to the drums on "Seeing You Again". And the drum program on "Beyond the Edge" (an extra on the CD, and soundtrack to the well-known film of the same name...) shows why nobody does it like that any more. Oh well, there are better tracks. "Lonely in Love" has an interesting saxophone duo and is a really strong pop song, one of the best on the album. "What You're Doing" is a raunchy bluesy track with, for a change, some especially good percussion and a ragged edge to the voice that works quite well. "Hearts in Decline" slows things down, and is just vocal and piano, nicely executed, while "The Way It Must Be" softens the tone with a slow-rock rhythm and a catchy tune. He goes over the top sometimes on this album, gets pompous and horribly unsubtle, all the usual Fogelberg failings, but it could be worse. A period-piece more than a classic, it's not the Fogelberg album to start your collection with, but there are worse.
