 Finally travellers to Reykjavik get to buy a book that doesn't cover the whole of Iceland. As a result, it's much more compact (pocket-sized) and relevant to people who are going to stay in the capital most of the time. This will apply to most first-time visitors to Iceland. The book does mention some of the more obvious trips you might make from the capital, but concentrates on the city itself. It's a bit like a mini Rough Guide. Not stuffy, seems to know about the 'in' places to eat and be seen, the cool places to go, and yet has all the basic, sensible stuff you'll want to know about a city before you go there. I'd say it's just about on the money.
