 I've just been to Helsinki for a few days, and although I didn't get the chance to test this book's usefulness in other parts of the country, it certainly proved worth having just for Helsinki. It tells you all the basic stuff, and some of the interesting stuff. I was able to get from the airport by bus and walk to my hotel from the bus station simply by glancing at the book on the flight to Helsinki. Everything is very clear and nicely laid out, and it's a handy size too. I hope I'll return to Finland; this is the first thing I'll pack.
