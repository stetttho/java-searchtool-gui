 "I hate fashion, I hate it with a passion..." McLean thumps out in this clumsy admission that he really doesn't have anything to offer us in these modern times.  Headroom is neither fashionable nor passionate -  it's just plain awful. On this album Don McLean seems to have forgotten how  to write and how to sing. The title track is a tuneless list of modern  maladies - the only thing he misses out is this record. It can only prepare  you for worse to come on an album I guarantee you will play only once.
