 It's difficult to know how to pick out one of Bread's "proper" albums from the others. This isn't my favourite (that accolade goes to their eponymously titled debut offering), but it stands up well to the rest. "Guitar Man", the song, is an absolute classic, of course. But if all you wanted were the classics, you'd buy a BEST OF compilation. So what do you get here? "Welcome to the Music" is a bit of a curiosity; more like something they'd do live, for a laugh. Funny lyrics. "Make it By Yourself" is an excellent song that should be more famous. Classic stuff. "Yours For Life" is a bouncy, sing-a-long number with a particularly awful line in it that always makes me wince, but it's certainly catchy. "Tecelote" is a bit of dreamy seventies nonsense. The fact that there are really only three big hits on GUITAR MAN mean that it could be a good album to get if you already have a BEST OF and don't want to do too much duplicating.
