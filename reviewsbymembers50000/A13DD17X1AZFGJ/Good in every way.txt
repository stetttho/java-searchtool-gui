 I like Josh Ritter's voice, I like the tunes he crafts, I like the intelligence and poetry of his lyrics, I like the way he assembles the sounds on this album. I like the delicate yet robust production. There are jangly songs and sparse, quiet songs; there's the thought provoking and the humorous. There's everything you could want from a record. Little wonder that everybody's giving it five stars.
