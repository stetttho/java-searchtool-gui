 I've just had one of these for a few days to play with. It's a nice looking, nicely made little camera. A little thicker than some other miniature cameras though, and the square shape wasn't particularly easy to hold on to. Still, it's pretty nice looking. I liked the speed it starts up: the lens really romps out of the body. It has a good sized screen too, but it's not so great in sunlight, and very dim and grainy in poor light. Focussing in poor light was nothing special either; there's no assist lamp. It's simple to use, despite the lack of the more usual (and better) four-way controller. You access up and down menu items with the oddly (and badly) positioned zoom controller, which has an unpleasantly short travel and `clicky' feel to it. In playback mode, you use it to zoom in to your photo, which it does extremely slowly, then enter a different mode to scroll. Rather clumsy. Anyway, I managed to master all its functions without looking at the instruction book, so it must be quite intuitive. I was distinctly underwhelmed by the photos the Fuji took though. They were okay for snapshots but looking closely revealed lots of noise and rather fuzzy edges to things. My 4MP Canon Ixus takes much better, sharper photos. I don't think the Fuji makes much use of that extra megapixel. Even so, it's not a bad little camera. It's cheap, looks nice, is a doddle to use despite the awkward controls, has a reasonably large and colourful screen and starts up quickly. I wasn't too impressed by its primary function though: taking good photos. If you just take snapshots and print at small sizes it'll be fine. But then you wouldn't need 5 megapixels...
