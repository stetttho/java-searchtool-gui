 Mark Weigle largely builds on the strengths of his very good first album. I guess this is more of the same to some extent (no bad thing) but growing confidence in his subject matter shows through songs like Good Day, a  bouncy, sexy, uplifting pop number that's great to sing along to. The rest  is a nice mix of slow romantic stuff, a bit of country, and the upfront  queerness that makes Weigle that bit more interesting.
