 . This is a very small dictionary with just one column of large type on each page. There are 177 pages in the Icelandic-English section, so you can guess that there are in truth, not many words. When you're doing a simple translation from English to Icelandic, this isn't too much of a problem, because if you're a native English speaker, you can always find a substitute word if you can't find the one you really wanted in this little dictionary. But when it's the other way around, it's a big, big problem. To test it, I downloaded the daily free newspaper in Icelandic from the Morgunblai website, and attempted to translate some simple articles using this dictionary. Barely one in ten of the words used in the newspaper were in the dictionary. So for that, it was useless. You may find it more useful if you're good at recognising the irregular declensions, or at splitting compound words into their components, but even then, I think you will find that this dictionary simply doesn't have the vocabulary. In fact, it barely meets the definition of a dictionary. Think of it as an expanded phrase book and you'll be nearer the mark but then, it doesn't contain any phrases. Unfortunately, there isn't much else on the market unless you can get something from Iceland itself which would be expensive. If you really need to translate even the simplest of texts, this book won't do.
