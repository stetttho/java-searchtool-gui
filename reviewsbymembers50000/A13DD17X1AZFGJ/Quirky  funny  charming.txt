 Somehow, even the spaced out layabouts of Iceland are appealing in this film, set in the dark months of Reykjavik's winter. The main character, Hlynur, lives with his mother, provides the hash, does nothing. "What kind of nothing?" Hlynur's mother's girlfriend asks,and he replies, "The nothing kind." Nothing much happens in the film either, but it's an interesting nothing, with a good soundtrack and curious images of the bleak winter streets and the bohemian cafes and bars of 101 Reykjavik. If you've been there, it's also fun to spot the places you know. Mostly it's subtitles, but quite a bit of the film is in English. The sound quality seemed particularly good to me.
