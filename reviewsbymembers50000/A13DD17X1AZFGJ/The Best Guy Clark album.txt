 Well, it's my favourite anyway. First thing that struck me was the sound: sharp as a knife, right in the room, yet rich and comfortable. The band are as tight as anything, and the whole record feels like it was was put together by somebody who knew how to get exactly what they had in their mind. Good songs too, all by Guy Clark of course. The title track is probably my favourite, and one of Guy's best ever songs. A very appealing combination of a great lyric, good chorus and neatly woven acoustic guitars. I like the blues songs on this album too. Like How'd You Get This Number and Picasso's Mandolin - the latter an interesting combination of off-the-wall lyrics and crystalline guitar work. The duet with Emmylou (I Don't Love You Much Do I) tops off a great album.
