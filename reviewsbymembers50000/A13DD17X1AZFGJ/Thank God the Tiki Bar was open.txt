 Much will be made of the return of The Goners on this album, but it isn't a second SLOW TURNING. In fact, I was reminded of several stages in John Hiatt's development when I listened to THE TIKI BAR IS OPEN, from SLUG LINE and TWO BIT MONSTERS through RIDING WITHT THE KING and, indeed, SLOW TURNING. This album is pure, unmistakable Hiatt; it couldn't be anybody else. Hiatt throws his usual variety into the pot, so you won't get bored. Standout track for me is the title track which has a great bouncy, spooky feel to it; skeletons in haunted houses would dance to this... "I know a Place" deals with a child who murders its father (dark stuff, with Hiatt howling like you've never heard); "Hanging Round Here" is a wry look at the way things turn out with great guitar from Sonny Landreth (applies throughout the album); "Something Broken" slows things down to "Lipstick Sunset" pace, and is moving and affecting; "I'll Never Get Over You" is a superior re-recording of a song that appeared on PERFECTLY GOOD GUITAR and now sounds like a standard. The final song is Hiatt at his most psychedelic, nearly nine minutes worth of Beatles-esque (I'm thinking Strawberry Fields) vocals and wailing guitars. There isn't a "throwaway" track on the album, which gives it a very satisfying feel. Quite an achievement.
