 All these five-star reviews mean that everybody likes this CD a lot, so you will too, right? Well, you'll be impressed by the brilliant liquid mandolin. The rest of the playing is hard to fault too, I guess; they make a very sweet sound together. The lead male vocal is quite appealing too, but the lead female a bit too flute-like for my tastes. They both sound young and innocent - maybe a little too much so. Drawn in by the song "When You Come Back Down", I'm a bit disappointed to find that none of the other songs are much like this, and certainly none are as instantly appealing. There's a lot of instrumental stuff that is very good, very well played, but just a tad dull. Some of the songs they've chosen to sing are a bit dull too. If it was all as good as that song they keep playing on the radio, I'd like it a whole lot better. As it is, I think it'll be going in for early retirement on my shelves quite soon.
