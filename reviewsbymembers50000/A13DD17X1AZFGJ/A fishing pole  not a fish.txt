 There are two types of graphic design book. One is the coffee-table type that looks very nice but is of little use to designers looking for guidance or inspiration. In fact the contents are often so glamorous, that they are disheartening, especially for the beginner. This book belongs to the other type, the one without the gorgeous layouts, but with the power to inspire. It gives you the tools to make you a better designer. I've had no formal training as a graphic designer, and though I (luckily) found from this book that I was doing a lot right, my eyes were opened to some other things I'd never thought of, even some quite basic rules about typography. After I read the book (it's the sort of book that you read quickly, with excitement) I wanted to go back and re-design all those things I was disappointed with but didn't know how to fix. It all seems so obvious now! This is so good, I've also ordered Robin Williams' more advanced book.
