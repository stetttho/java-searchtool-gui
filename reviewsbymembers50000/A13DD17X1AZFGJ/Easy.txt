 Greg Brown kind of takes care of you when you put on one of his records. You know he's going to get it right and make you feel the way you want to feel: contented. And so it is with this one, a collection (an odd collection in many ways) of mostly old tunes. The one I love most is 'Foggy Foggy Dew' which is a perfect, rather sad, but lilting folk song, beautifully arranged. Like all the tracks on the album, the sound quality is, as we've come to expect from Greg Brown, to audiophile standards. If you've got a decent hi fi, it's like having him right there in the room with you. Every song on this album is carefully, but simply crafted, and I suspect it's something I'll want to listen to for many years yet.
