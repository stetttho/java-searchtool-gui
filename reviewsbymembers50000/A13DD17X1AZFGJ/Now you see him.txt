 Living in the UK, where Dan never sets foot, it seems, this was my first chance to see him in action. The songs are familiar, if reduced in number, from the "Greetings From the West" CD. The best ones are the purely acoustic versions. "Make Love Stay" is exceptional. Best bit about the DVD is that there are between-song snatches of a Dan interview. Sound quality is pretty much as the CD as far as I could tell. Picture quality is okay, but nothing special.
