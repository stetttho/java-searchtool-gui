 I took this back to the shop after a weekend with it, before even having the photos developed. Reasons: 1. the zoom control has a kind of "delayed-action" effect to it that makes it extremely annoying and difficult to frame your shot quickly. 2. The shutter release has even more of a delay. Forget action shots unless you photograph sloths and tortoises... 3. The case it comes with is huge. I can't see the point of making a camera so small then supplying a case so large. Having said all this, the results from the one film I put through it were fine. So if you take pictures of things that don't move and you don't mind lugging the enormous case around, you may be happy. PS. I swapped it for a Canon Sure Shot 120 Classic which is everything this isn't.
