 If you found Oh Susanna's previous album a bit of an acquired taste but like the voice and the quality of the sound, perhaps wished for something a little easier to get into, then this is for you. It will grab you right from the opening song which is so delicious, you might have to play it a couple of times before you move on to the rest. The arrangement is so subtle and simple and quiet, but the effect is captivating. Suzie's voice can be soft and intimate - playful and arch, like on the first track, or upbeat and even pop-tinged, like on the second, but it is always right for the song. She sounds young, yet wise, sings about the sea, and strange relationships, knows how to put together the catchiest pop tune, then slows it down to pure folk. Sound quality is excellent too and perfectly suits the spare arrangement and Suzie's electric guitar highlights. It's a very intimate, appealing sound. Suzie sounds like she's in your living room at times. Highly recommended. Four and a half stars really.
