 Ni Albini is the story of a young man out of place in his small town life. He's a genius, but the type that everybody thinks is really an idiot. He's just under stimulated. The film is a series of incidents and scenes, often amusing, usually quirky. For instance, I like the scene where Ni's schoolfriend brings a tape recorder and places it on Ni's desk. When the teacher asks, the friend explains that Ni couldn't make it that day. Or the part when Ni discovers his grandmother playing the violin in the wardrobe to avoid disturbing her dead husband. This is the sort of thing you can expect. There isn't much of a story as such. But the ending is unexpected and unsettling. Fans of Icelandic culture will be happy (although as the director explains, this is in no way meant to be a realistic portrayal of life in Iceland), and you'll see some nice snowy landscapes. But the star of the film by a big margin is Ni himself, brilliantly played with great understatement. An albino he is not, but he looks different enough for this detail not to matter. The film is paced slow, but not boringly so. It is full of detail and undercurrents of meaning. I liked it a lot. It leaves an impression. The DVD has plenty of extras, like interviews with a very nervous seeming director, and scenes that he cut out.
