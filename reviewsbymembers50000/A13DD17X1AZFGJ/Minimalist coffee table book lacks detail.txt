 This is an attractively designed book, although I can't help thinking its minimalist layout and arty typefaces would look more at home if the subject matter was more modern. I suppose the cars themselves are minimalist, in a way, and definitely `arty'. Even so, the book looks like it would be about cutting-edge Italian kitchenware, not ancient oily cars. To some extent, the book is a triumph of form over function, certainly if you thought its function was to provide information in detail about microcars. No, it doesn't do that. There's barely any text, and most pages have no more than one or two photographs, so it really just gives you a fleeting impression of things. There's a section about people and their microcars, a brief section about the history of the little devices, and an A-Z of the main manufacturers. So, it's nicely produced, would look nice on your Ikea coffee table, but won't tell you all that much about the subject.
