 It makes a pleasant change to hear something fresh these days, and Ben Taylor is just that. This is pop music, with hints of rock, and folk. But somehow it's different to all the jangly me-too stuff you hear on the radio. Musically it's ambitious, and strives hard to be unique in its arrangements and melodies. And there's Ben's familiar (to anyone who knows his father's music) voice as the icing on the cake. Okay, so he sounds like his father, but honestly I prefer Ben's velvety tones. The songs are pretty much all very catchy, with good hooks, nice harmonies. I wouldn't call any of them great in the true sense, but this is nice, upbeat music that puts you in a good mood, and there's too little of that around.
