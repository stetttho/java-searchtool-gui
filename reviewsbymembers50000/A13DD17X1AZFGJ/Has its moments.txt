 This one's a little different. In many ways, I like it, and it's certainly far superior to River of Souls. But... there's a brash quality to the production that's a bit hard on the ears, and Fogelberg's (creditable, don't get me wrong) "thing" about the native people and the environment and all that... well, does it make the best material for music? You don't always want to be that serious and worthy. But if you do want to be serious, this album has some good tunes (as always) and Dan's vocals are nicely matured. Oddly, my favourite track is probably "Rhythm of the Rain", simply because he sings it so wonderfully. Bones in the Sky is good too, and Anastasia's eyes... though he sings them in a very slightly tortured way that I could do without.
