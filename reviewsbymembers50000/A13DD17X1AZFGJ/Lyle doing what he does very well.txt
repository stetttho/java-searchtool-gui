 . One thing about Lyle: whaen he does other people's songs, he does make them sound just like they're his own. Just as well, you might say, judging from recent releases. But for now, forget the fact that Lyle hasn't put out anything truly new for years and consider "Smile". Is it something to smile about? On the whole, yes it certainly is. The tracks on this album may well have been heard already in their respective movies, but do you know any of them? I doubt it. Except for the obvious ones like "Blue Skies" and "Mac the Knife" of course. There are some great songs, especially "Walking Tall", a song perfectly suited to Lyle's laid-back throaty delivery. But everything in this collection is delivered so nicely, you can't halp but like it, and if you like the cool jazzy sound of Lyle with his big band then you will like this. It contains some of Lyle's most listenable stuff to date. Who can blame him for putting it all on one CD?
