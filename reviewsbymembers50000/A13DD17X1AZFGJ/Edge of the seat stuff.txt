 I think this is just about my favourite science fiction novel. I don't read much in this genre, but this is exceptional. Not because of its "literary" qualities, or its characters - both are unremarkable. Clarke instead reaches into your imagination and implants one of the most alien worlds I can remember reading about. What's clever is how he keeps the sheer size of the giant spacecraft in your mind and uses that to make you constantly marvel. This is a novel full of suspense and pace. The "what's going to happen next" factor is very high, and keeps you flipping the pages. In fact, it probably won't take you long to finish it (because it's not very long), but you'll be very sorry that it ended. So sorry in fact, that you'll be very tempted to go out and buy the sequel, which is, unfortunately, dire.
