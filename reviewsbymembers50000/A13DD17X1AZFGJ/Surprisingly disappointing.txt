 I could pretend that all the songs are as good as "Make Love So Hard", "Turning to You" and "Late Train to London". If only they were! Then we'd have another Sunflower on our hands. "Make Love So Hard" is a simple but perfect pop song. "Turning to You" is a proper Darden Smith song. "Late Train to London" is clever, intricate, atmospheric and moving; I love the way Darden's vocals connect with the bounce of the violin in the bridge part. "Mill Creek" is pretty good too, but I'm not sure how it fits on this album. It feels to be from another place. Truth is that the album starts off weakly with the rather lightweight and unimaginatively arranged "What Are We Gonna Do". It's a bit of a nothing song. "Shooting Star" is in a similar vein. Pleasant enough I suppose. But then it gets scary. "One Hundred Ways" is horrible: uptempo in a Casio keyboard sort of way, a bit too jolly, too worthy, like something you'd sing in a church group. "Hands on the Wheel" has an equally silly arrangement, and the awful line, "So go with God..." Do what? No, no. The next track has a seductive swing to it, but there's more God, and we run straight into "Rise" which is another churchy one. "Circo" sounds okay if you stick it on while you're doing the dishes, but I expect so much more from Darden Smith. It must be middle age, or fatherhood or something that's turned Darden a bit woolly on "Circo". I want the old Darden back please.
