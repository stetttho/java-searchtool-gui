 This album, together with Hangin' Around the Observatory, make a nice little pair. I know Hiatt kind of disowned them but they are interesting, especially for fans. Overcoats is better recorded and more appealing. Some  quiet, reflective songs on here, an some of Hiatt's wackiest stuff. Bring  the Family it is not!
