 John Hiatt's loudest album, you've got to be in the mood for it. When I'm not, I just pick out the exceptional tracks and leave the rest for a loud day. The title track is one of those: a quintessential Hiatt song with howling guitars and sassy, unusual lyrics. "Old Habits" is the best song on the album though, and almost worth the price on its own. Hiatt gets into an unmatched swamp-groove on this track. Perfect. The rest are mostly good, if sometimes uncharacteristically lacking in light and shade. Only "The Wreck of the Barbie Ferrari" makes me want to skip on to the next track. So, if you like the Hiatt style, and can stand the extra noise, you'll probably like this well enough, but it wouldn't be my choice of your first ever Hiatt album.
