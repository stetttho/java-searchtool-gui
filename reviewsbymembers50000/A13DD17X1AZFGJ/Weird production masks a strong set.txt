 The sound on this album is so noticeably awful that John Hiatt either wanted it that way or made some terrible choices in the studio. There's no light and shade, no depth, no colour, and Hiatt sounds like he's shrieking down the phone half the time. The band seem competent at best and Sonny Landreth's famed guitar skills are lost in the mix. But the songs are good, as you'd expect from Hiatt. I particularly like the line, "How bad's the coffee, how good's the pie/If you call me honey, honey I'm gonna cry." I could've lived without the vulgar references in several of the songs though, which don't add much, just stick out for the wrong reasons. Is he trying to shock us, or trying to be "hip". Whatever, it doesn't work. If you like your music to be kind of unrelenting, rough around the edges, and plain old loud, you'll probably be blown away by this, because there's real quality in the writing. If you don't, like me you'll wish he'd done this set of songs properly, or given them to somebody who would've.
