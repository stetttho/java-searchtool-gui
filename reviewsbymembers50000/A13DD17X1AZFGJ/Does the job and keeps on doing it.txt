 I've used mine for a few years and it hasn't lost its edge. I haven't used a can opener that's any better, and I've used many that were worse. The only possible gripe is that it struggles with tiny rectangular tins. POSTSCRIPT: Died in January 2003 after a slow decline! I guess I'd get another the same though it didn't last as long (nearly 4 years) as I hoped.
