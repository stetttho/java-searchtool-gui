 I like Greg Brown when he's being wry and lyrical. This CD is gruffer, less melodic, less intimate and unfortunately, less appealing. Most of the songs are half-spoken instead of sung, and I just wished there were a couple of gentle tracks to break it up. If you like your folk music bluesy and growly with lots of words but not many tunes, this will be for you. It's not bad, but so not my favourite GB album.
