 Kelly Joe Phelps plays blues guitar like nobody else I've ever heard. His guitar playing is a highly unconventional, intense, sometimes furious, lyrical, almost freeform backdrop to his stories. Fascinating to watch him, hunched over the guitar laid on his lap, seemingly lost in his own little world. The voice that tells the stories is smoky, also intense, focused. The songs on this album seem mysterious (like the title of the album) at first because you don't hear the lyrics for a while, just the words - but the words seem interesting and emotive all by themselves, even when you haven't tuned in to the meaning. Tuning in is an essential part of listening to this album. You won't get to know the songs unless you listen a few times. Probably many times. Then the rapid-fire guitar starts to make sense, you begin to hear what he's saying, and you'll start to really enjoy it.
