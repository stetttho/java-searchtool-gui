 ... especially in this case. Rendevous With Rama was a breathless 1 day read, full of tension and amazement. It leaves you desprately trying to picture the thing in your mind. Rama II is simply drivel. Clarke tries to  give us lots of stuff about his "characters" but writes like a  schoolboy. Who cares about the characters? You won't, that's for sure. Then  there are the tedious, naive descriptions of the earth's history since the  first Rama.... skip past them. In fact skip the whole book. Or read  Rendevous again which is a classic. Or go and find something else. Don't  waste your money.
