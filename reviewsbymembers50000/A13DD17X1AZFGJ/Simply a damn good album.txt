 I think this is Darden's best(not that there's anything wrong with he others). More a rock album than his first couple, full of catchy tunes and great ideas - you'll find yourself singing these songs in your head  after a couple of listens. It's one of those albums where every track  gives you a renewed sense of pleasure at having bought it. Why it didn't  make Darden a big name is a mystery.
