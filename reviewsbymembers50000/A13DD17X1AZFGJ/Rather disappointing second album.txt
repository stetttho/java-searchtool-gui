 Hammer and Nail was such a great album that it was almost inevitable this one would be something of an anti-climax. There aren't any really great songs on here, which must be a bit of a worry for Paul Thorn. Worse still,  there are some really pretty weak, throwaway tracks (like What Do You Take  Me For and Mood Ring) that are just padding. Too often he uses the same  kind of verse (witty, quirky, full of references to Oprah Winfrey and stuff  that'll get SO out of date) and just does a different chorus. The lack of a  real live drummer on many of the tracks doesn't help either and while the  production on Hammer and Nail might have been a bit mainstream, it was  certainly better than the uninvolving sound on Ain't Love Strange. Still,  Paul Thorn does have a great voice (though not much of a range, it has to  be said) and this is not a BAD album... But... should've ben better. Much  better.
