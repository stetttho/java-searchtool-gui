 Must confess I haven't listened to this since I ditched my turntable and lost the ability to play the vinyl. This is Andrew Gold's attempt to be a rocker. My problem with it is that, although it's catchy and nicely done (as you'd expect), there's no real change of pace throughout. Thing is, if you're into loud rock music, you probably wouldn't want to listen to Andrew Gold anyway, and if you're into Andrew Gold, you probably wouldn't want to listen to loud rock music. My advice, unless you're  a completist, is to get ALL THIS AND HEAVEN TOO, or THE SPENCE MANOR SUITE first.
