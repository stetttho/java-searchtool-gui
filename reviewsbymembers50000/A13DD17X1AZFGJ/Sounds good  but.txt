 I'm ,always convinced I'm going to grate my knuckles into the cheddar (although I never have) and the fear of it prompted me to buy this.  But the truth is that it doesn't really do such a good job. You have to cut the cheese into quite small blocks to fit into the machine, and I found it tended to clog up. It's also a menace to clean. In the end, I put it away and went back to my old (traditional) grater which does a perfectly good job. And I still haven't lost any skin to it...
