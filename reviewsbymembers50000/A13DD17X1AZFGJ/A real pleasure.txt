 This is the Dan Fogelberg CD you can put on when your friends are around! You needn't be embarrassed. This album shows how Dan's career really does add up to something. Those old songs sound better than ever with a bit of  grit in the throat, and the new song and blues covers are a treat. Playing  with a live band seems to work magic too; Dan sounds to be having FUN, and  that makes all the difference. So what if the recordings were made years  ago? This is well worth getting.
