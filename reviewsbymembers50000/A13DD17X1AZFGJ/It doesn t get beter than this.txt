 This is just great. DonMcLean's best album, full to bursting with perfect, timeless songs you can listen to thousands of times. There's real poetry here, and humour, and simply some of his best ever tunes. And all produced  with an immensly likeable delicacy only Homeless Brother can match. BUY IT!
