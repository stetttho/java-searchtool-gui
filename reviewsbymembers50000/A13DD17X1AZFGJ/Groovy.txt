 Well, that was just one word that came to mind. Of all Bonnie's albums, and there are plenty now, I come back to this one time after time. Songs like "Good Enough" and "Walk Out the Front Door" are definitely groovy enough to make you want to dress up in something from the seventies and dance rather embarrassingly. Just remember to tone it down for some of Bonnie's most aching ballads, like the impossibly perfect "Run Like a Thief", and the sumptuous, almost Streisand-esque "My First Night Alone Without You". "I'm Blowin' Away" is another one. It's hard to choose a favourite, but they all have that ability to tug on you and make you part of the song. I defy anyone not to sing along to just about every track, right up to the simple bar-room singalong of "Sweet and Shiny Eyes", the perfect ending to one of my favourite albums of all time.
