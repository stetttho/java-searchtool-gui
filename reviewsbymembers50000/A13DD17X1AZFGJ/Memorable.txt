 Italian Rain, Bish claims, is his first political song. It's sung from the point of view of an Eastern European victim of war who stares across the sea and longs to feel the rain (and the freedom) in Italy that's so close yet out of reach. it's a very affecting song. But done so deftly that it never sticks out as "The Political One" even though Bish himself draws attention to it. It fits right in with the folk-pop-jazz-rock that Stephen Bishop has been sporadically producing for years. This latest one is pleasingly acoustic in feel unlike the previous "Bowling in Paris". Presumably that was why he felt it was time to include "Separate Lives" (again). The definitive version perhaps. How does Bish still sound so good after all these years? His voice has an incredible purity and he hits some remarkable high notes. It's all beautifully put together, very dense, meticulous. And yet frivolous at times (King of Tonga...) with moments of pure and perfect pop. Tracks like "I Go Numb" and "When You Love Somebody" show that Stephen has lost none of his ability to craft the kind of song most artists would be deeply jealous of. There's nothing quite like a Bish album. This ranks highly with his masterpieces from the seventies.
