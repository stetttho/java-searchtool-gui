 There's a lot to like about this album. Ryan Adams' voice is quite appealing, except when he's doing the rock star thing, though it's not that distinctive. There aren't any bad songs. Some are better than others though: "I See Monsters" is especially unusual and interesting and has one of the more interesting arrangements. The first five songs are quite similar, jangly, mildly raucous affairs, but from track six on, the pace slows and the songs improve, or at least they become more tuneful and varied in construction. "Wonderwall" is a sparse, acoustic track - a standout track. The others are all pretty good too, yet I feel I should like them more than I actually do. Not sure why. There's something about Ryan Adams that I don't get. I think it's the man himself: I've no idea about who he is, and his personality doesn't seem to come through the music. Maybe I need to listen longer. Well, it would be no hardship.
