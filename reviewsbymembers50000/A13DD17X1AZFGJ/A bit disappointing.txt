 I just bought this to add to the collection I built up as a child before sealing it all away for a rainy day. Thought it would add something. Main problem for me is that the illustrations are so grim. I suppose you shouldn't expect too much from such a low-budget affair, but on the other hand, there is no excuse for grainy little images nowadays. So it's 2 stars. If you're strange enough to want to know all this stuff though, I guess you'll have to buy it, because the choice in this field is not exactly wide!
