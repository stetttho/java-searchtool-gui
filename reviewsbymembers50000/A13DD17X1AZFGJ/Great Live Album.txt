 Hiatt does some different things with one or two songs here, just to keep us on our toes, and the album is all the better for it. John is in fine voice too, and although he doesn't say much between songs, there's still  humour and a fantastic atmosphere. For me, Feels Like Rain is the standout  track, but there's a great mixture, and all impeccably recorded. Turn the  volume up, the lights down, lie back and just pretend you're there...
