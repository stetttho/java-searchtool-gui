 With so many artists pushing out endless compilations of their old material, it's refreshing to see that Darden, original as ever, does it a little differently. So this one's worth buying even if you've got all of his other albums. And you get one new song. Okay, some of these versions aren't THAT different from their original versions, but some are - Loving Arms on solo piano for instance... maybe worth the money for that alone. In some ways I prefer the "Deep Fantastic Blue" material on here than on the album, just like I do when I hear him "live". And there is a bit of "live" recording here, with some judiciously edited applause in the background. If you're unfamiliar with Darden's work, what's wrong with you? Start here so you can decide which one to buy next.
