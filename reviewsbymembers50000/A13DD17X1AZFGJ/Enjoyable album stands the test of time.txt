 Years before Nanci Griffith thought of doing Other Voices, Other Rooms, Don McLean came up with this collection (tribute is too strong a word) of  folk songs from bygone days, interspersed with some tunes from the likes of  Buddy Holly (a great version of Everyday). Nicely recorded, subtly done,  one to treasure.
