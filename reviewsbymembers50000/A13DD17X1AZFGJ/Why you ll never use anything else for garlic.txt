 You may have tried garlic presses before. They were probably yhe type where you have to peel the garlic first. Then they're a menace to clean. This is different, mainly, I reckon, because there is NO NEED to peel the clove. Just throw it in, squeeze hard, and that's it. Usually, the skin comes back out cleanly first time. If it doesn't, it comes out easily on your knife. They even give you a little plastic thing to clean out any excess, but I've never needed it -- it's very easy to clean. I think this will become one of those ESSENTIAL gadgets. I might buy another now, because if mine ever broke (it doesn't feel like it ever will) I'd be lost.
