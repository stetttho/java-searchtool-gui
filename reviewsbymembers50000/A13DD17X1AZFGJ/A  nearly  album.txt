 I was reminded of Lucinda Williams most. I prefer Eliza Gilkyson's voice (one of her best features) though. But like Lucinda, I get the feeling that I'm supposed to like it, and it's sometimes stronger than the feeling that I actually do like it. The album opens strongly with 'Highway 9', a little like Kate Campbell with an earthier groove. Yeah, this is a good song. And it gets better! The next three, four, maybe five tracks are very strong, nicely (interestingly) arranged, convincing melodies, good lyrics. At this point I'm thinking, This is really good... But by the time we get to 'Ballad of Yvonne Johnson' it's starting to go downhill. This is too literal for me (we're talking child rape) and this is a fault of some of the lyrics here. They're too 'soap box'. Issues need to be worked into songs more subtly than this. And this ballad seems to go on for ever! I never reconnected with the album after this, and the final song grated on me with its hackneyed and naive 'Peace, peace, peace' lyric and Iris Dement's, er, distinctive vocals. So, this album ultimately fails to live up to its promise. A shame.
