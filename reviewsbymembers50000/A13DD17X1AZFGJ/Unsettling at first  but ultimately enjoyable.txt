 I wasn't very receptive to this film when I first saw it. I was distracted by the foul-mouthed Allen character; made to feel uncomfortable. Which was the point I guess. The film opens with a vicious argument and a strange, repeated image that unsettles. If you were expecting something else, you have to adjust. I adjusted better the second time through and enjoyed it much more, hence this edited review. There are plenty of good jokes (like the out of focus actor, played surprisingly subtly by Robin Williams) and set pieces. The scene when Harry visits his sister is particularly funny - classic Woody Allen. On the whole, I felt the film was treading old ground perhaps a little more than usual. I don't think of it as one of my favourite Woody Allen films, but it does stand repeated viewing.
