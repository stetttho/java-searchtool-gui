 . The first thing you notice about this album is that it's really well produced. Fogelberg's albums often sound synthetic and over-produced but this one sounds organic and attractive. It's quite an unusual "country" album. I don't know another one like it. It's very "Dan Fogelberg". Shame he didn't do more in the same vein. There is a mixture of original songs by Dan, and some by other writers, but they gel really well. The stellar cast of musicians do a fantastic job, showcased especially on the instrumental "Wolf Creek", a rollocking, bluegrass tune that is especially effective and exciting. Dan's vocals were never better than on this album too. The style of the album ranges from ballads to bluegrass to gospel. All of it seems to genuinely suggest the title too. This really does seem like "High Country" music. Very highly recommended.
