 If you like your films to be fast food with extra fries, if you live in a trailer perhaps, or drink lots, perhaps get into fights and have the police around, swear like a trooper, didn't do too well in school, shout to your friends at the other end of the street, buy books at the supermarket, wouldn't know good dialogue from bad/great acting from not so great, think that George Bush is right about gay marriage, or maybe went to an American Idol audition even though you can't sing... well, get this film because YOU ARE IN FOR A TREAT.
