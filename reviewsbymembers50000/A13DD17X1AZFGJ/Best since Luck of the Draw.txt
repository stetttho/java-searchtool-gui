 I always buy Bonnie's new records. The last two or three didn't stay long in my CD player though, even though there was nothing fundamentally wrong with them. They just didn't grab me, didn't get me humming the songs to myself. They were a bit, well, boring. I expected this to be more of the same, but thankfully, it isn't. The longer than usual pause between albums must've given Bonnie time to produce something more interesting. Perhaps producing the album herself for the first time has helped. The good news is that every track is worth listening to. So it's a very strong set. It has a good variety of styles too, from ballads to stonking bluesy rockers. Bonnie sounds great on this album, so anyone worried she might be past it can rest easy! She isn't. No, instead she's worked hard making these songs sound interesting, aside from their already catchy melodies. There are some very interesting things going on that gives the album a rich, vibrant, complex feel, without losing any of that famed bluesy rhythm. The songs are so uniformly good, I'm struggling to find one I like more than the others, but I'm always a sucker for a Bonnie ballad, so `I Don't Want Anything to Change' stands out a little. I like the gentleness of it immediately after the rocking `Unnecessarily Mercenary'. `Deep Water' is one of the more experimental songs on the album, and the great thing is that it really works. That's the surprise for me with Souls Alike: it really does move things on a bit, and yet has all the things we fans need a Bonnie Raitt album to have.
