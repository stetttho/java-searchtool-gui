 I bought this right after seeing Kelly Joe Phelps 'live' in Leeds (UK). He's definitely somebody you should see (he's amazing), and seeing him helps you picture where all this stuff comes from and how he gets into it. This CD captures Kelly Joe's solid, yet intricate and crystalline guitar perfectly. Watching him play is mesmerising. I think this CD also shows him as an artist who is growing, and judging by some of the new songs he played in Leeds, the next studio album will be a treat. But here, I particularly love 'Cardboard Box of Batteries', which is slow and perfect, every pluck of the guitar string perfectly woven into those smoke vocals. Such subtlety. Such restraint. Such complexity too: there's enough to keep you listening for years; each song is like a miniature blues symphony. Just like in real life, KJP doesn't really say anything in between tracks, so don't expect any chat. It's just him and the music. Which is fine by me when the music's this good. Kelly Joe is the real thing. I highly recommend this.
