 The songs on this album sound oh so familiar. In other words, there's not much new going on here; it's a bit of a rehash of Road to Ensenada, and not in a good way. I got bored with it. The only song that stands out is the excellent and moving "You Were Always There". When you hear this track, it makes you realise what's missing from the rest of the album. It's not a bad album, of course, but after such a long wait, I expected more.
