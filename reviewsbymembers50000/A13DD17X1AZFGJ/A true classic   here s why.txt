 After the demise of Bread in 1973, David Gates was quick off the mark with this fine album, and perhaps aiming to prove that he could do even better without the assistance of James Griffin (even though the other Bread members lend their talents on "First".)  I think this is a better album than any of Bread's. Bread were better at singles than albums. David Gates (as a solo artist) the reverse.  Freed from the need to compromise within the group, David came up with an extremely cohesive album (some of the musical themes echo around more than one song) that seems just as good when I play it today (and I often still do) as when I played it back in, well, whenever it was.  Ignore all the rubbish about "soft rock" and "mushy" lyrics. David Gates is unique. His voice is actually incredibly distinctive. The songs are romantic, sure, but mushy? I don't think so. They have a kind of "yearning" quality, sometimes, and come at themes from odd angles, like the best songs always do. And the lyrics are almost always sure and poetic.  Couple this with memorable melodies that will never leave you, and sublime production that seems better than most of today's output, and you get all the makings of a true classic.  Who can blame David for harvesting this album when he put together his semi-compilation "Goodbye Girl" a few years later (which did contain several new songs, despite what another reviewer says)? He probably felt the songs didn't get enough recognition.  A trawl through a certain internet auction site will tell you how popular David Gates still is. It's a shame his fans are risking bootleg CDs of his unreleased albums because Elektra in their wisdom will not release his entire back catalogue on CD. This is misguided.  If you haven't already got this album, please get it now before they pull the plug on it.
