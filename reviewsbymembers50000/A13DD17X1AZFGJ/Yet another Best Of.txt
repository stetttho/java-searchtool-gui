 Well, no it's not just another compilation, since the songs on it are largely not the original recordings we all know so well, and of course because there's a DVD this time. The DVD first: this isn't quite as good as I expected, but it's nice enough. I doubt most will watch it more than once though. Mainly it's Don rehearsing with the Jordannaires. Then there are a couple of music videos that aren't particularly well done. The CD has some stuff even die-hard collectors might not have come across. Like the first track, a really nice version of Gordon Lightfoot's 'If You Could Read My Mind'. 'TB Blues' is another good one. But the rest are largely old ground, even if the versions aren't ones you'll have heard before, they're not that different. Some have been on other CDs. I was looking forward to hearing the newish 'Run Diana Run' but it turns out to be one of the worst on the album - it's done in the 'Headroom' style with a silly rock backing and no tune, just shouty, trite rhymes. There's a long, rambling piece in the booklet from Joel Dorn that doesn't really add much to the story. In terms of value, the DVD lifts this above the usual, but I was on the whole just a little disappointed.
