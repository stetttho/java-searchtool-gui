 I only have 3 Greg Brown albums. The last one, Slant 6 mind, didn't do  that much for me, but I gave this a try anyway. I don't think it's on a par  with the amazing Further In, but very enjoyable. Real Good Friend is the  stand-out track for me. The whole album is good, except perhaps for the  hidden track, and has a superb "live" sound that'll remind you  how good your hi-fi sounds.
