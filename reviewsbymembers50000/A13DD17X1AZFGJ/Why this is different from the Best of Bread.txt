 If you already have one of the many BEST OF Bread albums, and want to hear some more, this is as good a place as any to start. Bread's original studio albums are all equally excellent. The difference from the BEST OF albums is that you get to hear more James Griffin songs, because most of the "hits" were penned (and sung) by David Gates. Songs like "Down on My Knees" and "Just Like Yesterday" have the unmistakable Griffin signature. They're not classics like "Baby I'm a Want You" or "Everything I Own", but very good nonetheless. Lets you see the other side of Bread.
