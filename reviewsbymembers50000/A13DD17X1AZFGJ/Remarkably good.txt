 I liked Ben Taylor's first release as the Ben Taylor Band well enough, but I thought some of the songs were a little weak, and I wondered what Ben's great voice would sound like in a softer, more obviously acoustic setting. I didn't think he'd dare drifting too close to his father's territory though. On this album he's managed to give me what I want and yet be himself. So this is definitely much better than 'Famous among the Barns'. While I'm not convinced any of these songs will become standards, they're all really good. He has an ability to pen a catchy tune, and arrange it in an interesting and distinctive way.  And then sing it beautifully. Because of course it's the voice that's the best bit - one of the most seductive new voices around at the moment. Ben's sound is reminiscent at times of some bands from the sixties, but not overtly so. It also sounds very new and inventive. It's a nicely produced album, bringing the vocals to the fore, with clean harmonies and sparkly acoustic guitars. Mostly a relaxing sound too, with no heavy or loud tracks to upset a late night chill out session, something this album is good for. All in all, well worth getting if you like acoustic melodic stuff and want something fresh and new.
