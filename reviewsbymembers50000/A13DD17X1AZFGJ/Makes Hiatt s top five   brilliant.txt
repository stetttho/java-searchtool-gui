 This is a very atmospheric album with a good variety of styles. It features rythmic, rocky songs, like the infectious and brilliantly delivered "Cry Love", solid country-rock songs like "Dust Down a Country Road", weird-lyric songs like "Ethylene" with unusual arrangements, and stunningly laconic, laid-back songs like "Your Love is My Rest" or the hidden track, which I think is actually called "My High", not what it says on the track listing here. This is an album full of depth and a bit of intrigue, like the second secret track which takes you by surprise (well it won't now, sorry), and that, along with some of the odd guitar-work here and there, and a lyric or two, are like a nod at the Beach Boys, though this sounds nothing like the Beach Boys! All in all, a very satisfying, complete album that shows Hiatt at his best.
