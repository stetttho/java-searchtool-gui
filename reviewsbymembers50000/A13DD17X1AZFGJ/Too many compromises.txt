 When I first got this I was pretty pleased with it. It looks very cool, brings up a cool new display on the screen, has RDS, is dead easy to use, gives you the remote control so you can keep your iPod deep in your pocket, and you get a brand new pair of earbuds, with four new foam pads to add to the millions that have mysteriously vanished into the ether. I was quite impressed with the reception in my house too. But today I detached it from my iPod, and I think it may stay that way unless I really want to listen to the radio. So why? Well, for a start, all the extra wires are a pain in the neck and destroy the simple elegance of the iPod concept. The way the wires dangle from the remote gets annoying, and they seem to tangle up when you wrap the whole thing up and put it away. The radio reception is great in my house, but not so great on buses and trains. Which I guess is no surprise. It wouldn't be so bad if you could select mono to kill the reception problems, but you can't. Worse still, there's some kind of interface problem: I found my iPod (nano) resetting itself all the time. And not only that... but you can't just switch off your iPod and flick the lock. That doesn't lock out the remote. So you've got to power your iPod down from the remote too, and lock that. And make sure you do it in the right order. And it sucks your battery dry faster than usual. But most of all, it makes you think, why on earth didn't they put a radio in the iPod to start with!
