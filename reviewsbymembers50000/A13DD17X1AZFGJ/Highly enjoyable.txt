 You can hear how Darden Smith matured in between "Native Soil" and "Little Victories" when you play this CD. It's a mixture of Darden's slightly curious take on the world (in songs like "All the King's Horses" and "Frankie and Sue", and the more mainstream sound "Little Victories" achieves. But whereas the album "Little Victories" is both more mainstream and brilliant at the same time, "Trouble No More" can sound a little flat and lacking in colour. It's mostly the slightly repetitive choruses from some of the songs that make me say this. On the other hand, there are some cracking songs too - particularly "Fall Apart at the Seams" which contrasts a gentle, lilting melody with a gloomy lyric. "Frankie and Sue" is a curious song, but addictive nonetheless, and Darden also hits the mark with the plaintive ballad "Bottom of a Deep Well". All in all, it's enjoyable, memorable stuff, by no means weak, but not his best.
