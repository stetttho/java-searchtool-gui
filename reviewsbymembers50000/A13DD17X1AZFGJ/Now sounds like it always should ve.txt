 American Pie always sounded worse (technically) than Don's other albums of this period. Now it sounds as good. The remastering sharpens things up just a little without making it sound artificial, though I thought I detected a little 'pumping' on 'Vincent'. Of the two extra tracks, 'Aftermath' fits best and is a worthy addition to the album. I like the new cardboard sleeve and the liner notes (with lyrics). It's a great album of course, end to end, brilliantly performed and utterly memorable. This remastered version just serves to remind you how very good it is. Worth buying, or re-buying, for the improved sound and better liner notes.
