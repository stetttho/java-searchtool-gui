 I have to confess I was a little disappointed when I first played Garrin's new CD. But the best music grows on you, and this does too. I think Garrin puts the music together almost too carefully - I bet he's something of a perfectionist. If you compare his style with say, Josh Ritter, Garrin's music is more... `technical', perhaps even more subtle. Josh Ritter is looser, more earthy. Garrin's last album was a showcase of different styles. This one (which is probably more cohesive, stylistically) alternates between jangly and dreamy pop, the latter richer and more successful, underpinned by attractive acoustic guitars and laid-back percussion. Garrin's voice is, as ever, clear and warm, and it's the title track that best demonstrates all these elements. The final track does too, and is for me the standout on the album. 'Where Joy Kills Sorrow' is a very listenable album and will no doubt grow on me further, just like Garrin's first album did. It lacks a little richness at times perhaps, lacks the lyrical brilliance of someone like Josh Ritter, but counters these things by burrowing quietly into your subconscious and planting melodies in your head that you won't at first be able to identify. .
