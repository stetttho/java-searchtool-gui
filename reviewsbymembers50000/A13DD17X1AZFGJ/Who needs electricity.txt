 Just because this is cheaper than the others doesn't mean it will make inferior ice cream. It's cheap because you wind the handle yourself. It doesn't take too long, and you just have to do a few turns every few minutes - you don't have to twirl the handle non-stop for 30 minutes! What comes out is the same smooth ice cream that the other machines make. And you'll save some money. And it's easier to store because there's no wire trailing. (Great for kids too.)
