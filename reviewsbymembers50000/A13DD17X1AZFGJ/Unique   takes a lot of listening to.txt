 This album is just as good as the tremendous 'Shine Eyed Mister Zen' and quite similar to it. It's striking for the inventive and unusual guitar work, Kelly Joe's distinctive smoky, gravelly voice, and a rare depth. Be prepared to put in some work if you buy this outstanding blues/folk CD, because you need to listen several times before it comes into focus. There are things you'll hear on the tenth spin that you didn't hear before. It gets better and better and better.
