 This one is ageing well, like a fine wine. It's as good an album as you'll find in the Nanci discography. Nanci is writing from the heart here, and it makes for something different than the more obviously "folk" albums she is well known for. There are no stories about strange people. This is more personal stuff, more emotional stuff than we're used to. At times it is enthralling and perfect, like in "Talk to Me When I'm Listening" which has some inexplicably beautiful lines. But it's not all deeply reflective. The bouncy, brilliantly catchy "Going Back to Georgia" (duet with Adam Duritz from Counting Crows) demonstrates this. It's one of my favourite ever Nanci tracks. Almost all the tracks are excellent, inventive, intelligent, beautifully arranged and performed. I'm holding back on the fifth star for two reasons: "Time of Inconvenience" is not to my taste. I don't think it comes up to the high standards of the other Nanci originals. And "Southbound Train" is a Julie Gold song and therefore to me, a bit irritating. Leave those two out and it's an easy five stars.
