 This is mostly just Bish and his guitar, recorded in the most stripped-down way you can. There are several new songs, all of them pretty good and none poor. While it's interesting to hear the stripped-down old songs, it's the new ones that are most interesting. 'Make it Last' is particularly good, and a real classic Bish song.  After nearly thirty years, Bish still sounds pretty good, though you could say he's pushing it with the odd high note! Bish's acoustic/rock guitar style is distinctive and original too. I love the intro to 'My Blue Window' for instance. For Bish fans, a loyal bunch, it's essential listening.
