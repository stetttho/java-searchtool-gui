 It says something for Darden Smith back in his younger days that he could get Nanci Griffith and Lyle Lovett to guest on vocals - on his first album! It's not hard to see why they would though. This is really a first album from a young guy? Darden has such an ear for a distinctive melody and a curious lyric, that each of these songs becomes your friend after just a few listens. "Two Dollar Novels" is an especially fine song. So good in fact, that I'm always surprised Nanci Griffith didn't record it for herself. There's a great maturity to the writing in these songs that sits at odds occasionally with the sparkling production and Darden's youngest voice, but actually it all hangs together pretty well. Darden I think inspires you to want all of his albums, so if you've got others, you just have to have this.
