 Some of the instrumental pieces on this album would sound natural floating through the speakers of a hotel lift. They are rather pretentiously titled, and not much more than pleasant tunes. Tim Weisberg's flute only adds to that impression. But if you're a fan of the flute, you may disagree. To me, it gives this a very `seventies' feel. Quite fun though, if you're in the mood. Dan does put vocals on a few tracks, most notably the rather overdone and fairly unoriginal `Power of Gold'. Best stuff on the album is when Dan covers songs from the sixties and does a nice job. This album is the more appealing twin of the more recent `No Resemblance Whatsoever'.
