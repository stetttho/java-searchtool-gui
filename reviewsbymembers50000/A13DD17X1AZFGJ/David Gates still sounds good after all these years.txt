 While I would be happier if David Gates had finally released the rest of his solo albums on CD (will it EVER happen?), this was a very pleasant surprise in 1994. A typical mix of ballads and catchy, more uptempo tunes, this is a very good album. The first track is especially good. I was amazed how good he still sounded after 13 years without an album. Unusually for Gates, he has recorded one or two songs that he didn't write himself, but they are well chosen. A couple of the ballads are perhaps a little sloppy (there's a grammatical error (to make it fit presumably - something he has done in the past to better effect) in one that gets to me every time. But on the whole, this album is very enjoyable. Production and arrangements, by David as usual, are excellent. The sound is very good, but not "in your face". Well worth adding to your collection, but not as good as those unreleased ones (David, are you listening!).
