 I've been to Iceland a couple of times and been ashamed to find that the language is so alien that barely a single word of it filters through. I'm going again soon and I've decided I want to at least understand a little of what I hear and read, even though "talaru ensku?" (do you speak English) is a question you hardly need ask in Iceland. Learning a little of the language is all part of the fun! Having tried and discarded the impenetrable "Teach Yourself" book, I came across this, and find it much more approachable. I highly recommend getting the tape/CD that goes with this book. It really helps you understand how words sound when they are strung together in phrases and sentences. And it helps you get a handle on the subtleties of pronunciation. Without the tape/CD, it would be much less enjoyable. Thankfully, the book starts out very simply, with greetings, pleasantries, "my name is" etc. The progression is well judged, so you don't quickly feel out of your depth, and it's satisfying to realise that the things you learn early in the book make sense later on. There are exercises to do, here and there, if you want. I'd definitely recommend this to beginners who are more interested in starting to understand day to day Icelandic than studying Icelandic grammar. It doesn't give you lists of conjugations and declensions to learn, but gradually and gently introduces new elements of the language so that you don't feel overwhelmed, and genuinely feels like an aid rather than a hindrance. A warning though: if you're not quite familiar with ENGLISH grammar, you'll reach a point in even this book that could be a stumbling block. Make sure you at least know the difference between the direct and indirect object before you get to the chapter about declensions!
