 Some people worry that they don't know what Kelly Joe's songs are about, but it doesn't worry me. I kind of know what they're about anyway, once I've listened to them a few hundred times. In any case, it doesn't so much matter what they're meant to be about as what you think they're about. Like an abstract painting full of colour and texture, there's plenty to work with to build up your own picture. Listening to `Cardboard Box of Batteries', I see an old man and his memories, childhood trophies hidden away and that feeling you get looking at them again or just remembering. This is the image I get now, but I may well change my mind about it later on! Very few songwriters have the courage, or the poetry, to do this. As a listener, you need a bit of both to appreciate these songs, but they are well worth the effort. In this second outing with a band, KJP is clearly developing a style that's all his own and I'm certain makes up for the absence of his signature slide guitar. It's a seductive sound now, mostly gentle, even for the blues of `Knock Louder', with curious guitar and fiddle highlights creating the atmosphere to back up Kelly Joe's perfect vocals. If there's somebody around who does this sort of thing better, I can't think who they are.
