 This is an odd experience for a British Woody Allen fan: it's set in London and most of the characters are British, but it's not a Britain I know. Granted the characters are part of the landed gentry and a bit posh, but their speech patterns are all wrong. I watched it with a group of friends and we had a good laugh at the unrealistic dialogue that seems to come from Jane Austen's time. Actually it's quite offputting. There are some big question marks about the basic premise: Chris, the lead guy, is supposed to be from Ireland, but has a cut-glass English accent. And he acts like he's never been to London before. Like he's from another planet. The locations are all weird, perhaps partly because of the lack of 'on location' background noise. This is a very quiet London Allen's found. If only it was like that. What all this does is give the movie a very inauthentic feel. It's not helped by the the young lead, whose acting is wooden and unconvincing. It's possible he was floundering with the terrible script, but some of the other actors managed well enough. He though, more than anything else, makes the story hard to believe. You find yourself watching actors instead of getting involved in the story. The bits of opera thrown in at melodramatic moments are rather ridiculous too. But as mentioned, the script is perhaps the worst thing. It really does seem like some terrible Mills and Boon story at times, and you just can't avoid thinking about it, all through the movie. Bravo, I guess, to WA for doing something a little bit different, though as one friend commented, it's really just 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' without the laughs.
