 My first thought, when I heard about this CD was: Marty Robbins...? Who? So, I wasn't sure what the style of this album was going to be. In fact, I was prepared for anything: a syrupy tribute to some deservedly forgotten crooner, or an unfortunate indulgence perhaps - the album was inspired, I'd heard, by Don's son Wyatt getting a Robbins record as a present. Was Don just making this for his kids? This time, I needn't have worried. I don't suppose this record will receive much attention, but Don's name will no longer just be associated with Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison. You'll know at least a couple of these songs, even if you've never heard of Marty Robbins. `Singin' the Blues' is probably the most familiar, but `El Paso' runs it close. You may well know `Devil Woman' too. I can imagine Elvis Presley singing some of these songs, or k d lang perhaps, in one of her more ironic moments. Cowboy ballads mix happily with catchy up-tempo country numbers. Only the last track sticks out a little because of its truly awful lyrics. The best news is that Don performs them all with style and confidence. His voice is the best I've heard it for ages, as though this project has really enthused him. There's a lightness of touch to his performance that has been lacking recently. Must be the `fun factor'. Not only that, but Don has found a band that can really play, and they give these old songs a new lease of life. The sound, and the production, has a pleasingly crisp and contemporary feel. The old fashioned style of albums like `For the Memories' has been replaced with a sound Lyle Lovett wouldn't be too displeased with. That's a compliment, by the way. This, in short, is the best music from Don McLean in many a year, and an absolute MUST for his fans.
