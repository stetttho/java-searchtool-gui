 BACK TO THE CENTRE was a hard act to follow, so it's not surprising that Paul Brady didn't quite come up with goods here. In isolation though, PRIMITIVE DANCE is a fine album, despite its somewhat inappropriate title. This is NOT a dance album. Nor is there anything particularly primitive about it. In fact, it's quite sophisticated. Where BACK TO THE CENTRE was an essentially serious album, this one lets its hair down a bit with a feisty rendition of It's Gonna Work Out Fine (also covered, very differently, by Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor), the curious, inspirational, Eat the Peach, and the rhythmic Don't Start Knocking with its unusual interplay between the various elements of the song. You may not end up dancing, but you'll at least be tapping your foot. The Soul Commotion is a raucous and spontaneous attempt to be primitive, I guess, while Steal Your Heart Away is smooth and enticing. There's quite a decent mixture of the two. The final star is lost because of a very slight blandness that creeps in from time to time, and the song Just in Case of Accidents, which doesn't really work with Paul's voice, in my opinion. Bonnie Raitt covers Steal Your Heart Away on her LONGING IN THEIR HEARTS album, incidentally.
