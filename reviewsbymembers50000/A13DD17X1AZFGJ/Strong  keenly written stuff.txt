 This is my first Rodney Crowell CD. I think I may have been missing out. It fits right into my musical tastes though, and I see elements of the things I appreciate about people like Lyle Lovett and Guy Clark. So we've got that (just slightly) quirky view of things that makes Crowell's lyrics interesting and surprising; a bit of grit and experience that rings true; some damn good playing and some damn good tunes. The opening track (Telephone Road) has real drive and power and atmosphere. You know what he's trying to achieve: it's a kind of list of memories of a place but it's very visual, very strong. It's a good start, and there's not really a falling off, right to the last track. And that last track will have many wiping a tear away, I'll bet, if not now, then in the future. This is a pin-sharp, very attractive recording. Crowell weaves some interesting sounds and rhythms around these songs; it's an entertaining listen. Surprises are tracks like "I Wish it Would Rain" about a hustler with AIDS, and the more affecting "Wandering Boy", about, I guess, realising what matters in life. Johnny Cash's part in "I Walk the Line" made me smile at first too, but actually, it's a great combining of songs that works. I gave it 4 (4 really)stars because I'm not a fan of spoken songs and "Highway 17" sends me diving for the skip button. Guy Clark's " The Randall Knife" falls into the same category, but if you like that sort of thing, this could be a 5 star album for you. Highly recommended either way.
