 Imagine a book, half set in Italy, about a younger man's relationship with a (famous) older man, with a silly mother figure who weeps constantly and finds out her son is gay when she looks under the bed... Sound good so  far? Thought not. It seemed to me that Leavitt thought he'd better write a  book called The Page Turner before anybody else did, then pretended to  himself that any old story would do. Very nearly a waste of time.
