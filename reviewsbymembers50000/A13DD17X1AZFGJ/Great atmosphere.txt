 The best thing about this record has to be the way it's recorded. Anyone with a half decent hi-fi system will love it just for that. The small band Guy has gathered for this recording are as tight as can be and even  Guy himself stays in control of his fingers... Great versions of  Heartbreak, Texas Cookin' and Home Grown Tomatoes. He's at his best when  you can hear the smile on his face. She Ain't Goin' Nowhere is a classic  Guy Clark song too. I'm less enthusiastic about some of the slower  "moody" songs like Desperadoes (I can never understand the  popularity of this one) and he misses out songs from Boats to Build - my  favourite album. All in all though, a fine effort.
