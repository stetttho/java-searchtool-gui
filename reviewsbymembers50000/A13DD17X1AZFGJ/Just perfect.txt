 This is a seamless, beautifully shaped movie that grabs you from the moment it begins and holds you captivated to the end. Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as the repressed butler and Emma Thompson never better as the  housekeeper.  The tension between them is almost unbearable and no matter  how many times you see it, you still believe it's possible they might...  well, you'll have to see it. And if you can't, go one better and read the  book.
