 I've had the same experience with this album as I had with Little Head. I played it a couple of times, put it away when it wasn't speaking to me - and came back to it. So perhaps that's what you should do. When you come back to it, you realise that's it's very enjoyable, full of the usual Hiatt variety, good tunes, those Hiatt lyrics and its own unique sound. I've often hoped for a John Hiatt album with a simpler sound. I don't think I quite got what I wanted but this will do very nicely. On it, he sounds older, but more relaxed. Such a different sound to Perfectly Good Guitar , and the better for it. The standout track has to be the title track. VERY catchy, emotive, infectious - a classic Hiatt song. There isn't what I'd describe as a dud song here, though one or two are a little undercooked, like Only the Song Survives, which sounds like you've heard it before. The rest are well worth hearing though, and if you've a few John Hiatt albums already, this is worth adding to your collection.
