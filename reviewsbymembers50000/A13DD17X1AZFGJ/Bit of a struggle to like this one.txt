 First of all, I'm a big, big fan of John Hiatt. I have all of his albums. This one gets off to a cracking start - Real Fine Love is one of Hiatt's  best ever songs - but failsto live up to that early promise (apart from  Rock Back Billy).  So what's wrong with it? Well, I think it's a  combination of the production and his voice. The production, and the  arrangements, are rather ordinary, mostly. And Hiatt's voice on this sounds  so tight it's almost painful to listen to.  No, I was disappointed from the  start with this and I still am. There are plently of other great Hiatt   albums to spend your money on.
