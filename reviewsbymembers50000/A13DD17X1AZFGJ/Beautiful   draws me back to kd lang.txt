 Initially a big fan of k.d. lang, I grew a little weary of some of her vocal stylings, and hated 'Constant Craving'. It seemed to me she spoiled many songs by using her voice harshly. So after 'Ingenue' I stopped buying. However, I heard some of these songs and decided to give this CD a try. I am so delighted she sings these songs so softly and warmly. There's barely a screech on the whole album, and like Jennifer Warnes on 'The Well' she has been brave enough to sing a whole album of down-tempo songs. It makes a pleasant change. My only disappointment is the inclusion of two of Cohen's most covered songs. Otherwise, the album is one to treasure, and I can stand to hear 'The Valley' and 'A Case of You' over and over. If you want a rock or pop album there are plenty out there. This one is something else, in both senses of the phrase.
