 The surprising thing for me is that I now find it easier to use the pen for everything, and I barely use the mouse at all. Right-clicks with the pen take a bit of practice, but you get there. The lack of a scroll wheel is the only thing that makes me use the mouse for most things. Having said that though, if you hold a pen for hours on end, you do end up with a sore finger. Luckily, the cordless mouse you get with the Wacom is great, just as good as my Microsoft Intellimouse that is now gathering dust. Mind you, if you're the kind of person that likes to use a large area for your mouse, you might find using it on the tablet restrictive, but I don't. The tablet is very compact, yet big enough to feel natural and give you control. You can use it with surprising delicacy, and it feels pretty accurate. At first I was very disappointed that the pressure sensitivity wouldn't work with Corel Photopaint. But then I discovered that making tiny "dabs" in the Photopaint tablet Setup instead of the strokes it suggests make it work perfectly. Otherwise, it's a joy to use. Installation was a doddle, it looks and feels good, and it's very good value too. Main gripe is that I knock the pen out of its holder every time I take a drink of my coffee...
