 In this sweet little self-help book, aspiring royalty will learn the proper way to curtsey, the appropriate way to introduce one's consort to the queen, and which fork to start with at gala affairs. Characters from Cabot's popular series offer their expert advice, with romantic advice from Tina Hakim Baba and beauty tips from Paolo of Chez Paolo.  Lana Turner even makes an appearance to plug extracurricular activities. There is an initial emphasis on makeup, but at least Paola advocates for understated and low maintenance. It seems out of character for Mia to protest chinchilla capes and spout five ways to save the planet but not to mention choosing beauty products not tested on animals.  Phone etiquette is not extended to include cell phone use, although email is mentioned in a chapter separate from correspondence. Health, safety and good judgment are mentioned throughout, and chapters like "Proper Tiara Maintenance" add levity. Overall, good grooming and gracious are stressed, with Mia reminding girls to be kind, assertive, smile, and above all, to thine own self be true.  Not a necessary addition to your library collection, but this might make a nice gift for a young teen who is a fan of the series or film.
