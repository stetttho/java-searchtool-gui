 Lurlene McDaniel meets Bonnie Bryant in this short read about horses, justice and angels. 14-year-old Dusty's life can't seem to get much worse: she suffers from chronic back pain, the result of a driving accident that her drunk of a father was responsible for.  She misses her deceased mother terribly, and the horse she loves is about to euthanised.  Then a handsome and angry boy the color of moonlight appears and leads her suffering horse away to a pain free place.  Dusty realizes the mysterious stranger is Skye Ryder, the boy who was killed in a bizarre accident on her father's property - and he wants revenge.  Can she help Skye turn to healing instead of hating and hurting and thus save his soul? The haunting story progresses at a fast clip.  Springer's writing is showcased in a variety of points of view, and the text is broken up with log reports and diary entries.  The idea that Dusty loves Skye so quickly and completely is a bit implausible, but if readers can believe in angels, why not this too?  The predictable ending is satisfying nonetheless.  The cover blends the genres of the book flawlessly - a horse has a ghostly glow and the font and placement of the title is reminiscent of a sci-fi movie.  A solid choice for reluctant readers, this slim book may fulfill book report assignments as well as satisfy fans of horses, mystery, and the supernatural.
