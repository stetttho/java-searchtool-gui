 I crawled inside James Frey's skin and I could feel the bugs crawling over it. Stomach twisted and churned as he alternated eating and throwing up, eating and throwing up. Pulse raced - would he walk out? or stick it out? Would the girl be his downfall or salvation? I could not put this book down - had to get my fix to the end. This was a roller coaster ride through a subculture I don't need to ever experience firsthand, thanks to this horrific and gripping account - I had to keep checking the book jacket to see if he made it to the end. Glad he lived to tell the tale.
