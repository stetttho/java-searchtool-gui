 Newly endorsed by J.K. Rowling, this third book in the Cirque du Freak series follows the vampires assistant Darren Shan and his Master Mr. Crepsley in an adventure under the streets of a nameless city that turns out to be Mr. Crepsleys old stomping grounds.  An altercation with an old nemesis follows when Darrens friend and traveling companion Evra the snake boy is kidnapped by a vampanese. 	Gorier than the other books, Tunnel of Blood also incorporates a love interest for Darren.  Fans of vampire lore will enjoy the debunking of some traditional myths and the creation of new.  Darren makes an intriguingly sympathetic half vampire; readers will be pleased to discover the saga continues with a fourth title, especially since there are still loose ends from the first two books.  I can't keep these on my library shelves, the entire series is very popular with middle schoolers.
