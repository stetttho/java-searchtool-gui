 Foster child and incest-survivor Sara has a multitude of problems ranging from peer acceptance to sibling rivarly to acting out. When her best buddy Dulcie begins dating a jock, Sara takes a long time to accept him and his clique but Jon's parents are even slower at accepting Dulcie as Jon's Vietnamese-American girlfriend, and when she becomes pregnant, both are disowned. Depressed, desparate and alone, they contemplate a double-suicide. Can Sara save them and herself? Because Sara is an aspiring writer, the novel is delivered through emails, school assignments, journal entries, and news articles.  The unconvetial format was a delight and the English papers modeling famous short stories was a great plot device. As a writer and librarian, I really enjoyed the many allusions and literary styles in <<Love Sara>>.  Smart Lindgren manages to make her teens sound like normal cussing teens without spelling out offending swear words -- the use of chat slang was very clever. I could not put the book down, and in fact, I was so upset by the ending that after I went to sleep, I dreamed about the  characters and devised a happier ending in my dream!  Lundgren has created a American tragedy in the Shakespearean style.   The plot itself is a is a little overwhelmed with its many issues: incest, foster care, multicultural romance, teen pregnancy, depression, and peer approval, and the ending is resolved a bit quickly (I would have liked to see more of Sara's healing process) but the narrator's voice is raw and fresh.   The ending is an unexpected shocker that doesn't take the easy way out.  Perfect for fans of Speak.
