 Kurland takes the universal dream of the white knight and makes it happen for her characters.  Genevieve inherits a castle and is haunted by a handsome ghost who tries to scare her into leaving and giving up her  inheritance.  Somewhere along the way they fall in love. Can a human/spirit  relationship work?  Wonderfully detailed writing shows a love for the  period as well as talent for telling a good romance. (PS - I started out  reading Kathleen Woodiwiss, but I don't like the regency stuff really.)
