 Highlander Jaime MacLaughlin is a talented leathersmith unafraid of hard work or a little dirt.  When he meets his cousin Laird Ewan's half sister Emily, a fragile looking society blossom, the two take such an instant dislike to one another it is obvious they must be star-crossed.  The English lass tames the savage Scot as he develops dining room manners and learns to waltz, and her pretenses and prejudices are replaced by vigor and health. A disaster in the community makes them pull together, while Ewan's wife Anna's gentle meddling gives the lovers a prod in the right direction.  The plot suggests that readers may want to go back and read Ewan and Anna's story, and hints at a romantic adventure between mutual friends as well. Tame, predictable and safe for middle school readers, these short and uncomplicated romances are like chocolates  - some are higher quality than others, occasionally there is a surprise in the middle, and a sweetness lingers when you are finished.  A steady diet is not recommended, but once in awhile, it's ok to splurge on mind candy.
