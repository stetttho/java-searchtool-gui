 Traditional Sharon Creech - the journey theme.  In this case, orphaned Sophie takes off on a sea adventure from Connecticut to England with her 3 uncles and two cousins.  Together the motley crew repairs the Wanderer and sets off to England to see Bumpie, the father of the uncles, and grandfather of the cousins.  Each take a turn not only at each job in the ship, but also at narrating;  Cody, a wisecracker, gives us all the details about Sophie that she purposefully leaves out. Everyone has to teach the others something over the course of the trip.  Cody teaches juggling, Sophie tells stories, Uncle Mo teaches radio code. Typical of Creech, emphasis is placed on teaching and learning for skills and real life application, rather than to pass a test. The art and design is very striking.  Stylized black and white graphics that look almost wood cut head each chapter.  Equal appeal for boys and girls, pair this contemporary sea voyage story with the historical Stowaway by Karen Hesse.
