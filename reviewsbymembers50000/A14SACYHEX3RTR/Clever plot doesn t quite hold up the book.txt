 Sexually curious playwright Jennifer uses her script as an excellent device for playing out her fantasties...however, the fantasies I mean are the unfinished confrontations between the dead sister.  And her curiosity isn't satisfied to this reader's satisfaction. Jennifer's play focuses on her competitive-but-never-quite-measuring-up-relationship with her now-dead sister, and she finds herself in a similar relationship with Kelly, the lead actress of the show.  A love triangle involving the producer is inevitable - who will end up with him?   The plot is clever, and the play is an excellent device for revealing character and allowing the character to play out her fantasties.  Jennifer has the wishy washy voice imparted by new authors, something the editor should have cut to the quick.   As an exploration of sibling rivalry, suicide, competition among women, and the process of scripting to opening night, this is a great story, but wondering about unexperienced sex for pages is not particularly sexy.  The denoument fails to deliver, and in the only other scene, that might be considered sexual, Kelly comes on to Jennifer, something we are almost expecting that would add a delicious shock to the tale... but since Jennifer is really innocent and practically taken advantage of, it is hardly a turn on. The scene flats flat when instead of going with the flow, she calls a halt to the activity. Purchase for the humorous qualities, rather than the erotic potential.
