 A recovering teen heroin addict whose caretaker hosts a national radio call in show gets the scoop of a lifetime when she runs into the prince of a small European country in upheaval. Torn between making a new friend and her duty to her media queen aunt Kit, Kelly has only 24 hours to win over the prince and convince him to appear on her aunt's show. This is a modern day fairy tale with a twist - the characters are neither good NOR evil, simply humanly flawed and must arrive at tough decisions. Qualey pulls the reader in from the first page and provides an engrossing story that allows her protagonist to make profound and believable change.  Midwestern readers may appreciate the setting more than New Englanders, but the topical references don't detract from the story.  Only be revealing her past can Kelly help Tom, the king to be, accept the mission of his future, and in turn, resolve her own conflicts to move toward her future.  This is a finely written and well-paced novel. Highly recommended for fans of Gail Carson Levine.
