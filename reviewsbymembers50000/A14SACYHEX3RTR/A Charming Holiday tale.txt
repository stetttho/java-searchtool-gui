 Cheerful and charming illustrations pair with a simple story about a missing reindeer to create this amusing and touching picture book.  The cadence of the text works well with the humorous dialogue, and the ending has a warm and fuzzy feeling.  The topical references to the City of  Brotherly Love don't limit the audience, although the book may have special  appeal for Philadelphia natives.  Very young children may not get the  humor, but will still enjoy the story and illustrations. Pair with  "Olive, the Other Reindeer" by J. Otto Seibold and Vivian Walsh  for a quirky reindeer storytime for the older preschool set.
