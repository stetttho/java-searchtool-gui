 Mary Elizabeth "Call me Lola" Cep is the new girl atDellwood High in NJ.  A star at her old school in New York, shediscovers the role of drama queen at Dellwood is already taken - by her soon-to-be rival Carla Santini. The two girls vie for the same part at auditions for the school play, and compete for invitations to a party given by THE band of the minute. This is a funny, funny story. Sheldon is dead on with her insights into teen fashion and pop culture, high school social hierarchy, and parent/teen relationships. Lola is a likeable character with a strong voice.  Her melodrama and tendency to twist the truth, even outright lie, make the story a giggle-out-loud riot.  Supporting characters are uneven, some realistically zany, some weak and predictable. There isn't enough humorous fiction published for teens, and they badly need a dose. Pass this one on to someone who needs to laugh
