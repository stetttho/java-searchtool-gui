 Jareth is a neglected teen on the verge of turning into astatistic: a suicide attempt is triggered by his abusive alcoholicmother (in police custody for beating his sickly younger brother nearly to death). A friend's stepfather becomes his salvation. The healing process includes learning trust and responsibility through new friends, a job, turning around the life of a younger teen, and developing his artistic talent.  This was an well done book with a lousy packaging. The title stinks...just Jareth would have been better. The misleading blurb on the back implies that Jareth goes into therapy to change. Although he attends 2 therapy sessions and spends a day in a mental hospital, neither is helpful, and Jareth ultimately is his own catalyst. The cover art, a photo of an attractive, smooth skinned young man, is unappealing. The writing however, is detailed and real. Jareth is a complex and dynamic character, and the supporting cast are well-drawn individuals. Occasionally the author's voice intrudes, especially at the end of each section, and the epilogue appears tacked on and heavy-handed.  Still, teens who can get past the cover will enjoy this survival story.
