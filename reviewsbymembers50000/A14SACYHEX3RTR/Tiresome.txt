 The first book was refreshing and funny, soured only by continous lesbian bashing.  The second book was decidedly less so, and by this third installment, I am personally quite sick of listening to materialistic, shallow and self-centered Brit Georgia Nicholson whine about her parents, friends, and school. Even the subplot - Angus' courting of the neighbors' cat is so out of control Georgia's dad threatens to have him spayed - is not funny. In Knocked Out, Georgia, having recently hooked up with an older Sex God, is abducted by her parents on a family vacation to Scotland, which she refers to as Och Aye land and insults with her usual brand of dramatic sarcasm.  Upon her return, she cheats on her new boyfriend by snogging the guy she used as bait to make the first boyfriend jealous, and debates her decision to date a hot but unavailable older guy versus a funny available boy who obviously likes her IN SPITE of the fact she blatantly used him in the last book.  When Dave the Laugh tells her she has to choose, she is in a quandary for all of a DAY before deciding she will find a way to have both. UGH.  She is a thoroughly despicable character. Still, the Printz award stamp on book one and the fact that the prequels were popular will make this a likely choice for most libraries.
