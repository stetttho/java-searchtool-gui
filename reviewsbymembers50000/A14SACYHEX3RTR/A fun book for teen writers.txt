 In this episilatory novel, 16-year-old Liz, an aspiring writer, begins a correspondence with Julia, a real New York book editor.  Julia encourages Liz's work and sees some of herself in her ambitious young friend, and Liz  imagines Julia living out the glamorous, hassle-free life she hopes to have  one day.  Then an argument threatens their mentor/friendship, and Liz is  forced to examine her life, and Julia's actions, with "fresh  eyes." The novel is nicely put together.  Journal entries and chapters  of Liz's great American novel are interspersed with letters to Julia.  It's  fun to compare the three difference versions of specific events in Liz's  life as they play out in the various formats: diary, letter, fiction.  The  mentorship is wonderful and special  - every teen should be so lucky as to  have a caring and knowledgeable non-familial adult friend - but the idea  isn't completely believable.  Liz's enthusiasm, while refreshing, was  sometimes overzealous.  She acted less mature than 16 or 17.  However, I am  certain that teen writers will relate to her passion and empathize with the  difficulties of family and the craft of writing.  Literary and artistic  allusions may alienate some readers, but may inspire them to seek source  materials.  Cover art is intriguing and appropriate.
