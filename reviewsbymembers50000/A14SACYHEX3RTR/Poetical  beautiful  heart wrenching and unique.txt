 In Stop Pretending, the unconventional topic of mental illness is addressed in a unique way from a new voice: narrator Cookie uses poetry to express her confusion, grief, rage, fear, and hope when the older sister she idolizes checks into a mental hospital. This trauma overshadows and flavors the traditional struggles of being a teen: peer acceptance, family squabbles, first love.  Sones's simple poems reveal raw emotion with immediate honesty and eloquence. Teens will empathize with Cookie and her family's experience.  A brief author's note describes her personal experiences the book grew out of. Organizations that provide and support are listed. A must have.
