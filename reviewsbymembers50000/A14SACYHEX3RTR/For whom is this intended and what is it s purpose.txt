 While it is a nice premise - Emily's sister Lavinia discovers her sister's poems - the book falls a bit flat.  The tone feels a bit condescending and dramatic in its attempt to engage young readers, and the narrative stops abruptly, launching into the poems with no commentary.  The letters to the world theme is hammered into the reader's head, mentioned no less than five times if one includes the subtitle.   The poems are printed in a spidery script to distinguish them from the narrative.  The font may be difficult for the beginning readers the book seems to be intended for.  The selections are a diverse mix of her familiar and lessen known poems, including "I'm Nobody! Who are you?" and "There is no frigate like a book."  The illustrations are lovely, with a smooth solid folk art look to them. Emily appears in each drawing, making it clear that we are seeing the world through her eyes. Although each poem (and therefore illustration) is quite different, a common motif of scattered flowers, leaves and stars and graceful undulating arcs repeat in the forms of branches, waves and earth, tying the volume together. A short note at the end divulges additional biographical information.  Sources are cited. The small size, simple language and bright pictures make this a nice choice for young readers, but it is not as well done as The Mouse of Amherst by Elizabeth Spires (Francis Foster, 1999) or Emily Dickinson: Poetry for Young People by Emily Dickinson (Sterling, 1994).
