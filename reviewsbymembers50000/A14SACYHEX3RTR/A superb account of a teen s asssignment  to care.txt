 Livvie is the new girl in town when she meets David in her biology class. The topic of the semester is sex education: a concerned teacher's campaign to prevent teen pregnancy, and to help young people make more informed and  hopefully safer choices. Through a variety of assignments, she teaches her  students not only the facts and statistics about disease and pregnancy  prevention, but also how to care for someone in a non-sexual way, and how  to express themselves. The teacher's realistic message is "wait as  long as you can."  The main project of the semester is "to care  about another person." David and Livvie choose to work together,  befriending Livvie's new neighbor, a frail and timid pregnant woman who  seems to desperately need someone to care about her The best part about  this book is Davis' sensitive writing. We experience everything through  Livvie's naive eyes, especially the growing affection between her and David  and the joys of first love. By contrast, the  problems in the marriage of  the new neighbors reveal themselves bit by bit. The horrifying climax  reveals the reason Livvie pens her story from an insane asylum. Readers  will feel her shock, grief and anger.  The deep empathy with Livvie shows  strong characterization, and the plot is much more complex than one would  guess from the title. This is a book that made me smile with fond memories  of my own first love, and weep for the characters. Sex Education is a must  have for any young adult library.
