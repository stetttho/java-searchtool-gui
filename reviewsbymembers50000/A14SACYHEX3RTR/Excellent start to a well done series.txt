 Morgan's peaceful plain life becomes a lot more interesting when she becomes friends with new boy Cal, who happens to be a witch.  He introduces Morgan and her friends to the earth-friendly pagan religion of Wicca through simple rituals.  Morgan is stunned and pleased but a little confused and wary of her newfound aptitude. When Cal's interest begins to turn to love, a rift between Morgan and her longtime friend develops. The novel is accurate in its details of witchcraft, promoting the Wiccan credos that everything returns to you threefold, and to "harm none." The novel is told through Morgan's narration; pre-chapter excerpts from a book of shadows are a clever way of conveying the subplot of Morgan's heritage. Hugely popular at my library with teen girls, this is a superior series to Daughters of the Moon, Circle of Three, T*Witches, and Witch's Chillers.
