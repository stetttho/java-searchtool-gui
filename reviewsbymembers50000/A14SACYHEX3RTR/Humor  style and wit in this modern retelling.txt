 Levine relays the story of Sleeping Beauty with humor, styleand wit.  As in her other fairy tale retellings, the heroine has bothbeauty and brains, and attempts to take charge of her own destiny. Further plot twists include a know-it-all princess, a dimwitted suitor, and an explanation for why fairies are no longer invited to naming ceremonies to bestow gifts.  Charming illustrations reminiscent of Lang's fairy books add to the text and extend the story.  The novel is attractively packaged in a non-standard size format with delicate scrollwork, regal gold lettering, and soft colors decorating a book jacket fit for royalty. Although the story isn't as strong as Levine's Newbery-award-winning "Ella Enchanted," fairy tale fans will enjoy both this title and her retelling of the Princess and the Pea, "The Princess Test."
