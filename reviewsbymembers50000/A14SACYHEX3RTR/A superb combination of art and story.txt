 (Note:  This review refers to the graphic novel version by Mojo Press) What a shame this item is no longer available!  This title reinvents Poe through illustration, most strikingly when the artist interprets the narrator of The Tell Tale Heart as a female servant revealing herself through dialogue, and the voice rings eerily true.  Also included in this graphic novel version are favoites such as the Bells and Annabel Lee, illustrated with dark gothic flair.  A must have for any gn collection, and a fine compliment to other Poe collections -- but good luck finding it!
