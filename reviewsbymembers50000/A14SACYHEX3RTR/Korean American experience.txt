 Ellen/Myong-Ok lives a double life: the dutiful obediant daughter of a Korean doctor and immigrant who expects her to go to Harvard as a science major like her bright older sister, and the gynmastics athlete and humanties lover who sneaks out to drink with her friends.  When a blonde blue eyed football hero starts to fall for her, it becomes something else to hide, along with the racism she experiences from students and teachers alike. Lee successfully juxtaposes American and Korean values, and presents a heroine who defines an identity she can remain true to.
