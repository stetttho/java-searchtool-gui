 In the wake of the popularity of the Harry Potter books come many attempts to jump on the fantasy bandwagon, and few manage it with the success and flair of J.K. Rowling. This fantasy tale with an old fashioned flavor is set in England at the turn of the century or start of the Industrial Revolution.  Meddler and inventor-wanna-be Bradford Ellis takes Lucy Beale under his wing, determined to benefit the poor seamstress at his father's school with a classical education during the summer holiday. As part of their education, the two are invited to tour a ship, which takes them on a journey to the Lands lf Legend where imagination, not progress and intellect, rule.  The text is unexciting and the premise weak. Because there is little history or explanation behind the magic, the story has no backbone. Lucy is the only fleshed out character with a history, hopes and dreams, and a skill at sewing that materializes into a real occupation. Brad is immature and frustrating, and it is predictable that he finally "gets it" and realizes that Progress is not the key to everything.  Part of a new series, it is hoped that the first two Voyages of the Basset, penned by award winning fantasy authors, are better than this third volume. Perhaps the attractive cover will lure readers; too bad the story within doesn't measure up.
