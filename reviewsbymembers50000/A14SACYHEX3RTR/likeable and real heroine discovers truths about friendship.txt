 Fans of Moss's series Amelia's Notebook and girls not quite ready for Naylor's later Alice books will find a likeable heroine in Fiona Claire Jardin. Age 11 1/2, she makes a New Year's resolution to find out what makes a good friend. Her discoveries are chronicled in her diary.  Entries  detail softball games, the onset of puberty, crushes, divorce and parental  dating, and middle school gossip. Fiona learns that sometimes it is braver  to admit one is scared, and sometimes, promises have to be broken.  The  writing carries perfect inflection of pre-adolescent worries.  Doodles and  lists break up the pages.  An underlying issue of eating disorders creates  an educational opportunity. It is obvious to this adult reader that one of  Fiona's good friends has a problem. The intended audience (recommended for  ages 8-12) may not already know of the behavioral warning signs of  anorexia, but as intelligent as Fiona comes across, it is easy to forget  how young she is sometimes, and she seems a bit naive.  Still, the  situation is handled gracefully and with hope. Young women have body image  issues younger and younger, and this title may offer not only information,  but reassurance as well. Readers who missed Cruise's first book will want  to go back and read it; the second title is stands on its own.
