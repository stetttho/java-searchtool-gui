 New Englander and college frosh Jenna Blake lands a job as a diener (look it up!) and in between her classes and her social life, assists with autopsies and crime-fighting.  In this fifth title in the series, there are  TWO mysteries: the mayor of Jenna's hometown has been murdered, and local  teens seem to be having breakdowns that result in homicide.  With her  support system home for the holidays, can Jenna crack these cases? Are they  related?   As it turns out, they are not.  The title refers to the second  set of murders, and the first case occasionally becomes a distraction. Had  the only focus of the book been the teens who murdered their families as if  brainwashed or drugged, the book may have been stronger.  The dual plot   does show how well Jenna and her boss work together as a team and how much  they have come to rely on one another as colleagues, not just  teacher/student. Golden makes an important statement through his heroine  in Jenna's passionate soapbox speech about the media's readiness to blame  violent behavior in young people on video games and the internet, when  factors such as environment and biology/genetics play an obviously larger  role (Golden's acknowledgement of Columbine perhaps?)  Yay Jenna! Yay  Chris, for being such a youth advocate!  Body of Evidence is an excellent  mystery series for teens. The cultural and topical references are fun and  up to the minute.  Golden builds suspense with scene shifts that allow the  reader to catch a glimpse into the murderer's psyche -- or the victim's.   Jenna is only a freshman, and has 3 1/2 years of college ahead of her...  plenty of stories left to tell.  How lucky for fans of the series!
