 David Catrow takes a Thanksgiving classic for a wild ride!  The long and stressful holiday road trip to a distant relative's home, with the car  stuffed full of siblings, pets, and food, is a universal experience. In  this whimsical picture book, the baby of the family escapes into a joyful,  snowy Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, where characters, floats and balloons  take on a life of their own.  The lively and imaginative scenes keep the  pace of rhythm of the text, and Catrow's cool midseason tones achieve the  not-quite- fall-but-not-quite-winter effect.  An ideal purchase for the car  trip to Grandma's - or for the sibling whom you used to draw seat boundries  with.
