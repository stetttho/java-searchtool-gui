 When Mom tries to force filthy Fister Farnello into the tub, he rebels and runs off into the woods and lives in his own filth with his new friend Dirt Man.  A fun concept falls flat with text bland enough to be left out  entirely. "Fister Farnello loved dirt" begins this picture book,  and right away, I thought, why didn't Slangerup say he "dug"  dirt?   Although the editor/author attempts to jazz things up by playing  with the text (bold, capitals, etc.) the writing is medicore at best and  the author tells instead of showing.  The descriptions of Dirt Boy at his  worst are redeeming, but the illustration still captures the scene much  more effectively. The pictures, mostly earth-tones, are wonderful, and  stand alone to tell the story.  Perspectives and mood vary greatly;  illustrations show a closeup of a joyful Fister grasping a muddy worm and a  larger than life giant sprawling off the page.  In one sad blue tranquil  scene, Mother languishes in a chair, snoozing and hoping for the return of  her wild child, and a blast from the hose bowls Fister over and shoos the  birds from their nests in his snarled hair. Details like scissors, rubber  gloves, and bottles and bars of soap drive home Slangerup's humorous  itinerary of what is needed to make Fister clean again, and a squeaky clean  Fister admits to the delight of washing the dirt off. If you share this one  in storytime, you may as well skip the text.  Show during a unit on mud or  hygiene, and serve up with gummi worms in chocolate pudding & oreo  dirt.
