  This cheerful and matter-of-fact book for preschoolers and their parents serves as an encouraging introduction to the mystery of potty-training.  A comforting letter to parents sets the tone for the book. A friendly dog acts as a guide and narrator, offering hints, tips, and activities.  The question and answer format is practical and effective.  Much of the content will go over the head of two-year olds, but there are other ways than simply reading the text to share this book and generate of discussion of toilet training.  The illustrations are multicultural and non-threatening.  The bright colors and fluffy dog have immense appeal, and the childlike font is a well-planned design element.  The book doesn't address the fears of flushing, and a bibliography for parents who need more how-to information should have been provided.  Not quite as effective as Once Upon a Potty, but could be used in conjuction with the classic.
