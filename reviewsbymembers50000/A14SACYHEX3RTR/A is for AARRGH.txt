 This wacky caveman story with intrusive authorship will be a hit with fans of Scieszka's TheTime Warp Trio.  Mog, son of the tribe's leader, just happens to invent words one day, starting with the word "sun."  A whole vocabulary ensues from nouns to verbs to adverbs.  Present, past, and  future tenses follow.  Lazy Drog masters the language and twists it to his  own benefit. Then Mog invents the word "if" and unleashes  wonderful stories from their teller, a mysterious and recently adopted  girl. Upstaged and under-appreciated, Mog leaves the tribe.  In his  absence, language leads to government, money, religion and misuse of power  in a television evangelist sort of way.  Mog returns in time to invent  poetry and save the day. A budding relationship between Mog and an adopted  girl serves as a subplot. Humor rules this novel.  In one especially funny  scene, Pog (Mog's mother) suggests that an eclipse is the moon passing  between the earth and the sun, rather than the end of the world, and the  Tribespeople "glare at her for making a joke at such a serious  moment."  While barely historically accurate, this pre-historic  Frindle is a fun speculation of how language developed.
