 When Kelly and her lover Mike have a spat about how to spend their gap year, they nearly break up before Kelly convinces him to take off on the van trip around Europe he planned with his friends before they met.  Kelly accepts an invitation to share an antique farmhouse in Greece with two acquaintance schoolmates so different they almost make up one complete person - while Sexy Jade exudes confidence as a man-hunting party girl who doesn't deign to lift a finger to do the dishes while, sweetly shy Sarah suffers from depression and swings of domesticity.  Poor Kelly struggles to keep the peace between the two old friends while regaining the identity lost in her intense relationship with Mike. Unfortunately, the delicate balance is upset when Jade comes upon Mike and his van full of buddies, and invites them for a visit. Comic trouble ensues. Cann writes with deep honesty about friendship and love, and her portrayal of sex is gut clenchingly real. Highly recommended.
