 Jeds life couldnt be more perfect; he has a cool car, a hot girlfriend, and a small circle of friends.  At the end of junior year he finds himself being stalked and harassed by a pissed-off goth girl who is convinced that Jeds father is having an affair with her mother.  Jed is a nonbeliever until Laura produces photo evidence. Some investigation on Jed's part reveals that Laura isn't all she seems either.  As the two teens begin to meet regularly to discuss what to do about their wayward parents and the impending breakup of their families, they bond, and come to care for one another.  To add to their problems, Lauras troubled thirteen year old sister runs away, and Laura and Jed go after her. Tragedy strikes. This is a heartbreaking book that reminded me of Garret Keizers God of Beer (Harper, 2002).  Weaver pulls the same tricks as Keizer and adult tearjerker writer Nicholas Sparks: everythings fine, everythings fine, everythings fine, WHAM! someone you care about is unexpectedly dead.  An allusion to the popular Sims game helps to drive home the hard-learned lesson that no matter how you plan, and in spite of all the things you can do right, life is unpredictable and unfair, but things work they way they do for a reason.  Recommended for most collections.
