 Lester's interpretation of Moses in the Bulrushes has a prince-and-the-pauper-like twist the pharaoh's daughter invites Mosis's sister and mother to come live at the palace with her and the baby she is taken in. Almah, the sister, is enraptured by the lavish lifestyle of Egyptian royalty and eventually becomes a priestess, while Princess Meryetamun begins to live a more simplified life. Conflict between the Habiru and Khemetian people is the central theme of the book. Lester includes rich details of ancient Egypt such as class distinctions, religion, food and dress; he remains true to the time and culture through his language and carefully selected dialogue. I found the author's notes the best part of this book; although the novel was carefully researched, an interesting idea, and well-written, it just didn't get me excited about ancient Egypt. A glossary and bibliography are appended.
