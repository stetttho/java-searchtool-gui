 This book is an exercise in tedium. Boring and poorly written, this book was produced mainly for Piper's fellow anti-semites who will eat up every  pseudo-revelation of Israel's perfidity.  It comes as no surprise to learn  that Piper is also a Holocaust denier.  Blinded by hate, Piper sees a Jew  in every woodpile.       The main thing I learned from this book was that  apparently it is now possible to prove that ANYBODY killed Kennedy.  Just  pick candidate and then throw around wild and spurious accusations, then  Unfortunately Amazon doesn't allow ratings in the negative numbers.
