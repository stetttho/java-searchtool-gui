 OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it. The pics are great and use is very intuitive. This would have gotten 5 stars, but I've found that indoor flash pics require manual adjustments after they are taken.  The pics are good, but the flash seems to be under powered to do well indoors without out a VERY GOOD light source.
