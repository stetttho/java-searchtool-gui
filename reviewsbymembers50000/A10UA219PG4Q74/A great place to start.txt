 This work does a good job of showing you how to use the major features of MS SQL Server 7.0. It describes how to install and configure SQL Server, indicating along the way platform-specific constraints and limitations, the implications of configuration choices, as well as recommended  settings. It contains many great examples and screen shots, many from a  beta release, but the author is up front about that fact. I disagree with  the preface which says that this book will teach you how to be an SQL  Server Administrator.  What this book will teach you is how to use the  tools and administrator will use which is 50% of what you need to know.   The other 50% will come from on-the-job training as well as other less  tool-oriented texts in database design, security, and programming. The  cover blurb does better job:  Learn the skills and concepts to master SQL  Server 7.0 in just 21 days.
