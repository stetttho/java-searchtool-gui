 It's a shame that these are in such low supply, as your iPAQ is just a toy without an expansion pack. Want to listen to tunes? You'll need addtional storage quickly.  Want to dial in to your ISP to surf or check your e-mail?  You'll need a CF modem to do this, which requires this expansion pack. I'm certain that Compaq made this an optional device to lower the cost of the device. However, this is a mandatory accessory for any iPAQ user.  It should have been included with the iPAQ.
