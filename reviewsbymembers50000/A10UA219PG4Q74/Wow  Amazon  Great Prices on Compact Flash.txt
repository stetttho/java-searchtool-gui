 I bought this Compact Flash Card for my Compaq iPAQ.  I had been trying to decide between this and an IBM Microdrive.  For the most part, Microdrives give you a better deal per meg, but with other costs.  Microdrives, being real hard drives, are sensitive to bumps and drops.  They also consume much more power than a compact flash card.  Microdrives are Type II CF cards, which means that they may not work in many cameras or other devices that only support Type I cards. This 128 meg CF Card holds hours of music or an entire movie.  It will have minimum power draw on my iPAQ, it will survive the tosses and tumbles of my daily iPAQ use, and it will be compatible with my digital camera. Thumbs up for a great value from Amazon.
