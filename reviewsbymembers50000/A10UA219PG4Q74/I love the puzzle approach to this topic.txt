 One of the few puzzle books for IRM types.  Joe's book is based on his columns in the now defunct Database Programming and Design magazine.  Overall this is an excellent book if you work with SQL on a daily basis.  I'd give it a 5 rating, but it's overdue for an update due to the fact that many, including Joe himself, have developed even better answers for the puzzles. This is not an introductory text -- you should have not only a knowlege of SQL but some real world experience developing and deploying SQL based applications. To get the most out of this book, make sure you make an attempt to solve the puzzles before reading the 'answers'.
