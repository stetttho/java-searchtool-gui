 I picked up this title on a whim one day and it has turned out to be one of the most valuable resources I have. Did you ever wonder how to handle those speaking disasters that always seem to come at *THE* worst time?...like your mic failing, or someone becoming ill, or your plane is late, or you have a terrible cold? Walters has collected some excellent advice on what to say, what to do, and most importantly, what *NOT* to say or do when these things happen..  A must buy if you ever have to speak in front of others.
