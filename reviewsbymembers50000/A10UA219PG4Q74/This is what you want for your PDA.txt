 If you own a Pocket PC and are in the market for an Ethernet card, this is the type you want.  Yes, you can use the PC Card from your laptop, but it probably has another type of connector with a dongle that connects to the card.  Fine for a wired laptop that sits in one place while you are connected. A Pocket PC, on the other hand (pun intended) will be moving around as you move your hands around, move around in your seat, etc.  This puts stress on the connection that the PC Card designers never imagined. Like the Pretec Modem, this CF lan card will survive your daily use much better than cards designed for PCs.
