 This website is my favourit spot for learning about Service Oriented Architectures and other emerging web services topics.  This site is more like a portal, with links to external sites that include:  - SOA related terms and glossaries - Introductory information about SOAs - Links to site on adopting, designing, and implementing SOA practices - Question and Answers (FAQs) about SOAs - SOA Whitepapers and webcasts  ..and more.  The SOA Learning center is my number one recommended spot for those wanting to learn more about this new topic.
