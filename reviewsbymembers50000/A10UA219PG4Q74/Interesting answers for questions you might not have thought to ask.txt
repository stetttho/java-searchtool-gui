 After reading the first chapter here on Amazon, I was hooked on reading this because I'd never thought to ask WHY to these tough questions.  This wasn't because I wasn't interested in the answers, but because I didn't think anyone would answer them.  It turns out that the authors sometimes answered these questions by ruling out other possible answers (as is the case with their assertion that women's choice to terminate pregnancies has caused a steady decrease in crime).  Sometimes the authors said that there was no provable cause, but that there were correlations that may be the answer (as in the case the causes for some children to be more successful that others).  While I found this a really orginal and interesting read, I couldn't stop myself from re-reading many sections to see where I missed the great leap from cause to effect.  As others have posted here, I think this work would have been much better with more content.  I don't mind the mis-mash of topics, but I do mind the rush to judgement that didn't take me along for the ride.  I do still recommend this as the topics make great debates with friends.
