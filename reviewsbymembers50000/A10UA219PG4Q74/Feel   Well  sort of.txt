 I was in the market for a new mouse and picked this one on a lark.  I travel a great deal and always seemed to pick up a lot of dust, dirt, and ...well... who nows what in the mouse, so this time I knew that I wanted to try an optical mouse.  While I was looking throught the offerings, I came across the iFeel mouse for just a few dollars more.  Hmmm...could this help me navigate windows, buttons, links, and other stuff?   During my first attempt at installing the software (regular drivers plus something called Immersion Desktop), the mouse worked, but no 'feel'.  A call to tech support went great (friendly, knowledgable, didn't try to rush me off the phone) but still no feel. I kept the mouse.  Months later, a hard drive crash required me to start all over again and... it worked!  Suddenly, as I moved the mouse over anything that was clickable (Window edges, Buttons, Hyperlinks, Menu Bars, Task Bar Items, Icons, etc.) there was a slight buzzing sound and feel to the mouse.  Sort of a vibration, but not what I expected.  I fiddled with the Immersion settings and found a set that seemed to work for me (less sound, less buzz). So know I have a mouse that sort of reacts to clickable things... Does it help?  No, not really.  Is is distracting?  Sometimes.  Does it really freak others out when they use it? Definitely.  Would I buy it again?  No, but I would pick out the non-feeling optical version of this product line again. So the product gets 3 stars.  As a general purpose mouse, I love it.  As an iFeel mouse, I don't think it does anything for me.  I give the overall product 4 stars, though, because good, helpful, friendly tech support means a great deal to me.
