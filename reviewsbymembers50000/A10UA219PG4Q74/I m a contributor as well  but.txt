 I have to say that I learned a great deal from the SHAPE forum, the discussion group from which these gems were selected. As a volunteer contributor to this work, I received no compensation for my efforts, which is why I feel justified in offering a review here. You can read how industry experts have handled difficult situations in project work: - Getting Started - How Big is It? - Estimating - What will it Cost? - Planning for Success - Management Focus - Knowing a Project is in Trouble: Project Indicators - Knowing a Project is in Trouble: People Indicators - People and Project Change - Being a Cassandra - Dealing with Impending Disaster - Doing Something Different - Dignified Project Death - Project Lessons - Personal Lessons My contributions, Sometimes It's Timing and Be Careful with Unsolicted Advice, tell my short stories that I wish I'd read about before they happened. Each contribution can be a learning (and laughing...and crying) experience for the reader. Jerry, Marie, and James have done a great job of boiling down the stories and insights that were shared with the SHAPE group over several years. This is a short work, but includes a great deal of free advice that's already been paid for.
