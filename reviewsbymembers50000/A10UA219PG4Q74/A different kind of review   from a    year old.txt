 As I axiously awaited the date for release, I tried desparately not read about plot rumors, false downloads, and spoilers. The latter was the most difficult, as many reviewers love to print spoilers, as if that is some sort of proof of intelligence.  There will be no spoilers here in this review.  Book 6 has definitely changed in tone, plot structure, and character development.  I found the tone not dark, as many have said, but more sad, perhaps to better reflect the age of puberty and angst through which the characters are passing.    This book is much more about feelings, emotions, and introspection than the first five.  Characters are much more likely to doubt themselves than in the past and are less likely to feel successful in their endeavors.  Even the antagonists are left with weaker confidence.  Could this his turn towards self-doubt and lack of strength be a reflection of Rowlings' own feelings?  These sad feelings affect all the characters, so how could the author be feeling anything but saddness in her life?  After finishing, my mind wandered to: why this type of story, why leave characters in this state?  My only guess is that this book was more of a transition to the book 7, setting the scene to wrap up our beloved Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  I felt slightly disappointed in the finish of this work, but it did leave me eager for more, which I guess is a good thing.  I can only give this 4 stars due to this disappointment and sadness.  However, I do recommend it, as I do the entire series, to everyone.  Here's hoping that J.K. Rowlings' next 12 months are happy and successful, as I want the final installment to reflect the good in Hogwarts.
