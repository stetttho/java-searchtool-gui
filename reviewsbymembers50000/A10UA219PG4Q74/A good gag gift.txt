 I received this as a gag gift since I'm not a big fan of the hunting games.  In Deer Avenger, you play the first person in the form of a deer, going after stereotypical hunters.  Along the way, though, you have to make sure you don't shoot any friends like the hiker or environmentalist. There are several weapons to be used as you progress in the game, both attacking ones and attracting ones (pizza, beer, etc.)  There are also 'attractive' sounds used to lure the unsuspecting hunter. I found the graphics in this game to be a bit behind the technology although the sound is appropriate for the scenario. Playing the game only stays interesting for the first few hunts as a typical gamer will find that this game is too easy and offeres very few twists and turns. Installation was quick and without glitches. So buy it as a fun gift, but don't think that it will keep the recipient busy for any lenght of time.
