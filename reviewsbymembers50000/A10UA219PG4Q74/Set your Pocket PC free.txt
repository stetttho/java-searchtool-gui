 Without a modem or ethernet card, your Pocket PC is just a PC companion product -- it must have a PC to get mail, surf, or message.   With a modem, your Pocket PC becomes a truly stand alone device. The Pretec modem is the sturdiest design I've seen for dialing through a regular analog phone line.  No frail parts to snap off, no weird connections that require you to purchase a different cable to connect.  You'll be able to take this right out of the box, plug it in and get connected. Your Pocket PC is just a toy until you have this modem.
