 Wow, does it again by offering twice the capacity of my 64MB Viking card without doubling the price of it. Moore's law, but faster. This card works great in my iPAQ and camera. I remember thinking foolishly when I got my 64MB card that I'd never have enough stuff to fill it. Was I wrong.... This card is large enough to fit several mp3 (songs), full feature film, and some audible and e-books with ease...not to mention extra applications. Plus, Viking offers toll-free tech support, something that not all vendors do. A very important thing to note from the technical details: (Note: Check the maximum memory capacity of your portable device before ordering.) Some devices, usually cameras, are limited in the amount of extra storage they can see. Don't buy more than you can use in your device. You may have to check the website or call the device vendor to clarify: some device documentation only mentions compatibility with smaller cards because these larger cards didn't exist then. My camera docs don't mention this size card, but it does work with it.
