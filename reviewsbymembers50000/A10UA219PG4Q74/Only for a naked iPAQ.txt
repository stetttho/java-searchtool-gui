 This case for the iPAQ 36xx Pocket PC will be suitable only for those that carry their iPAQ completely naked -- no CF expansion pack, no PC Card exapansion pack. There have been reports of some iPAQ owners managing to stretch the leather enough to use it with the CF expansion pack, but others have reported that the increased pressure on the iPAQ itself has resulted in problems with the screen. If you do decide to use this with a CF pack, be sure you use something other than your iPAQ to stretch it. Of course, once you've done this, you can't use it to hold a pack-less device. Overall quality of the case is pretty good, but not nealy as good as the Vaja cases. This gets a lower rating because it doesn't work with most iPAQ accessories - cradle, expansion packs, etc.
