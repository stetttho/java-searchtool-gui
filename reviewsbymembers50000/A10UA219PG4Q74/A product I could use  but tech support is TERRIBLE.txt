 Since I'm a Lotus Organizer user, I need a third party application to sync my calendar information.  Intellisync seemed to fit the bill. However, I couldn't get the software to install and all the Puma tech support would say is that if I was running any software (at all) other than Windows, they would not provide tech support.  She recommended that I UNINSTALL ALL SOFTWARE and call back!  What a terrible policy. Of course, I wasn't about to do that, so I installed it on another machine, which worked with just a few glitches.  That's when I found out that Intellisync will only synce timed calendar entries, BUT NOT ALL DAY APPOINTMENTS.  Since I rely on using ALL DAY appointments, it was useless to me. So if all you have is short appointments and no other software on your PC, you may be OK. Otherwise, try another product.
