 When this come out, I just had to have it.  I grew up reading White's works and it's funny how they were so illogical yet greatly entertaining. This film does a good job of helping even adults make that  leap of logic that allow one to suspend one's belief in how things work in  the adult world.  Adopt a mouse instead of a baby?  Sure! The DVD also  has a nifty game, some background "How'd they do that" feature,  as well as early tests of the animators. Overall a pleasant way to spend  some time, with kids or without.
