 While I've enjoyed almost every Grisham work, I've always hoped that he would stick to the legal thriller genre that I wanted.   Even with only a small focus on legal issues, I couldn't put _The Last Juror_ down.   The main players were at most caricatures of stereotypical people - the extraordinarily educated and well-spoken 1970s Southern Black Woman, the Loser College Grad turned Small Town Millionaire, the corrupt Southern Sheriff, the drinking, gossiping local Southern Lawyer, etc.  However, this use of caricatures managed to make an engaging read due to Grisham's knack at good storytelling.  My only negative about this work is that the ending twist is entirely predictable due to what seems to be an odd storyline in the midst of the book.    This 'giveaway' didn't spoil my enjoyment of the work.  I do recommend this to people who enjoy Grisham's legal works.
