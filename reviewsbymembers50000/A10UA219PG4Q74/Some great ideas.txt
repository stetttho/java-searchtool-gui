 This text offered some great insight in to how real millionaires (based on net worth, not bank accounts) lead their lives.  The assumption is that the millionaire lifestyle is the cause, not the effect, of their riches. I agree, for the most part, with Stanley's premise -- that the right spouse  is a good thing, that integrity will take you farther than deceit, that  reduce, reuse, recycle is a good thing, etc. -- but I'm not sure he's made  his case that these things lead to riches. I also was chagrined to find  that he equates money with success, often refering to those that chose to  work for the social good (teachers, librarians, social workers) as  "less successful".  Not everyone considers money to be the only  criteria for success.  However, the value of the types of lifestyle choices  he recommends are still considerable, regardless of one's need to generate  wealth.  I will be giving this as gifts to the young folks in my life.
