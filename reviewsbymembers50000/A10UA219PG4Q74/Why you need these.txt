 Even if you prefer other stylus features, you'll want to have spare offical Compaq ones that fit into the stylus slot on your iPAQ.  Depending on the time your iPAQ was manufactured, your unit will allow dust to get into the stylus hole and embed itself on your display.  Due to the side and backlight features of the iPAQ, these dust particles will GLOW brightly, obscuring portions of the screen. The trick to keeping dust intrusion to a minimum is to KEEP YOUR STYLUS IN THE SLOT AT ALL TIMES. If you loose you stylus, you'll be wishing you had a spare to plug up that slot again.
