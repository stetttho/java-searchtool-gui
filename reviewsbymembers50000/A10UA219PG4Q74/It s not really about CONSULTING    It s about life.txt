 This title by Weinberg is *THE* book to have if you fill any type of consulting role. Don't worry if you aren't a full time consultant - you'll find plenty of good rules on giving and receiving advice in this work. I have personally purchased 5 copies of this over the years because my copies seem to "disappear" as soon as I tell anyone about it.    Every single person who picks up this book on my recommendation takes the time to let me know how much they liked it - and that says something about Jerry's work. Because Jerry gets his points across by telling stories, this book is the perfect read for a flight, a few minutes between meetings, or when you can't take another seventeen noun, passive voice sentence that most IT texts use.   A must buy for anyone who works in teams, gives advice, or ....well, it's for anyone.
