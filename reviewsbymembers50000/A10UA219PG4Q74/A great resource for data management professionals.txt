 I've been a DAMA member since the late 80's.  I remember when the the only method a DAMA member had for communicating with their chapter and their national association was via fax and postal mail.  I even remember being part of dicussions about whether or not DAMA, I, needed a website.  It's ood to think now that this was ever a question.  The current DAMA.org website is chock full of resources for a professional data analyst, including:  - A career center with data-specific job postings - Postings about upcoming conferences and events - Links to local DAMA chapters, including chapters just forming - Links to DAMA's "professional groups". - Information on DAMA's newly formed Educational Foundation - A speaker listing for those arranging Educational programs (although it currently appears to include only speakers whose last name begins with 'G' or earlier in the alphabet). - A Listing of discounts available to DAMA members. - An archive of national newsletters  ...and more.  I really appreciate all the work that has gone into the current version of the website.   If you are working in the data management space, you should be bookmarking this site.
