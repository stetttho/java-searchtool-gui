 I was delighted to finally pick up this DVD after having seen this film several years ago.  What I remembered most about this work was that it put me into a reflective mood for several weeks. This film is likely to have  you thinking about what things and people are most important in your life,  what priorities do you put on them, and how living for what you truly want  is the best way to live. Ada arrives with her daughter on the beach in  New Zealand.  She has brought all kinds of things that are grossly  impractical in the jungle like environment...one thing is her piano.  Even  though Ada is mute, we hear her thoughts via voice over and via her playing  of the piano. Ada is forced through the cirucumstances of her life to  question what sort of relationship will make her happy -- that of her new  spouse, a perfectly polite and supportive gentleman, and that of a rogue  Harvey Keitel, one who goes to great lengths to prostitute Ada's need to  express herself via her piano. A strong performance by all, including  Ada's daughter. Eventually Ada makes her choice and leaves the audience  wandering if they have made their choices appropriately. This is a DVD  worth owning, not one to rent.  I would characterize this as a chick flick,  but not one full of relationship talk -- after all, the main character is  mute.
