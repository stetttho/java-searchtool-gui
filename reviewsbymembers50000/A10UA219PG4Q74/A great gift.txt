 This cookbook was written by Karolyn Grimes who played Zuzu Bailey in Capra's favourite film, _It's a Wonderful Life_.  This book would be a great stocking stuffer for the Lifer (person who loves the IAWL film) you love. While these recipes aren't actually used or referenced in the film, Karolyn has drawn together servings of love, laughter, and thoughfulness, much as this classic film has done for so many over the years. "No Man is a Failure who has Friends", so show your family and friends how they are truly the richest ones in town. ListMistress, IAWL Discussion Group.
