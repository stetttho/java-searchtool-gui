 I never thought I'd write a review of a dictionary, at least not as it related to data management.   However, when I'm working on definitions for a data model, I believe having an authoritative source nearby is a good thing.  Writing definitions isn't the most exciting modeler activity, but at least you can have a great head start with the proper reference.  This dictionary contains common acronyms, synonyms and abbreviations found in the retail sector.  It starts with "AAMA" [See American Apparel Manufacturers Association] and ends with "zoning price" [A geographic pricing policy in which the seller divides a geographic area into zones and charges each buyer in a given zone the base price plus the standard freight rate for that zone. See "market segmentation".  Synonymous with "zone delivered pricing"; "zone pricing."]  This work is definitely focused on US terminology, but does have entries for VAT and some other international concepts.    While I won't be sitting down and reading this work from cover to cover, I have used it when working with data and process models for retail clients and it has been a valuable source of definitions and knowledge for my teams.  I did find it odd that a key retailing term, "household" was not included, but it is referenced in a related term, "geodemography" [A retailer's tool that links households with geographic locations to identify regional lifestyles that impact directly on consumer attributes, behavior, and buying patterns.]  At just over 250 pages, it isn't a comprehensive guide to retailing, but it could be a great start for further research.  This book also contains an appendix of approximately 200 acronyms from the retail sector.  Overall this is a valuable resource for data management professionals working in retail-related sectors.
