 I lept right to _Family Matters_ after finishing _A Fine Balance_.  I had so enjoyed meeting Mistry's characters in the latter work that I need more.   _Family Matters_ delivered for me.   Mistry is able to expose his characters without direct description - we find the heart and soul of Jal, Coomy, Roxana and Chenoy just via their interactions. It's been a long time since I marked passages in a book in order to read them aloud to others;  in this work, I marked 5.  My favourite is the description of Roxana watching her son feed his grandfather.  I believe that some of the most memorable moments in our lives are the simple, quiet moments of beauty, much as Roxana felt while hanging her laundry. Unlike Balance, Family Matters left me with a feeling of peace.  That doesn't mean this work is better or worse; just sufficiently different from A Fine Balance. I suggest that readers tackle A Fine Balance first, then delve into Family Matters.
