 It is really sad that most people get their fitness knowledge from ads and product brochures.  This lack of unbiased information has led to all kinds of myths and misunderstandings about excercise and diet.  In the first chapter, Kolata asks some good questions - can you lose weight just by walking? Do any of those gadgets work? How well are studies about excercise an health run?  All great starts to a book that answers those and similar questions.  The author, in this half reference/half fitness biography, only answers some of them.  And it turns out that the number one answer is that Spinning is the best excercise.  Ok, maybe that isn't entirely fair, but I personally detest spinning.  Running, on the other hand, is a better fit for my life style and interests.  My point is that Kolata doesn't really leave any room in her recommendation for personal preference.  The most important myth busted is the whole "train between 60% and 80% of your max heart rate to lose the most weight"  You can see those programs on treadmills and steppers -- you know, the settings you could sleep through?  All due to a misunderstanding of the basic math of maximizing returns.  While all excercise is good, I'm telling you, working out at sleeping pace is not going to cause you to lose weight faster.   As the author is a science writer for the New York Times, the book does have the feel of more of a collection of articles than a cohesive look at fitness as a whole.  However, this collection approach does is not a major weakness.   I still recommend this read because so few books cover these topics in such a critical manner.  I leave it to the reader to decide how to interpret the findings.
