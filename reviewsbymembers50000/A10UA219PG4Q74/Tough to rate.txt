 PROS:  Kerzner's work is a great REFERENCE for those preparing for the PMP exam.  Kerzner is one of the driving forces behind those exams, so this work is one of the most recommended references for this sort of preparation.   CONS: I've never liked the extreme amount of repetition in this work.  Several times I had to set it down for a while because the repetition became difficult to ignore or just skip over.  I believe that repetition in learning is good; however, the repetition should be up to the student, not the author. The layout of this book, in my opinon, is distracting.  For someone who reads quickly, it can be distracting to have to stop on almost every page and do a quick scan of what was missed as one reads.  At times, the sidebars and callouts seem to emphasize the items of lesser importance.   OVERALL:  Treat this work like you would any other REFERENCE guide.  Don't try to read it from start to finish.  Use another exam resource, such as the PMP publications if you are preparing for the PMI exams.  Use another how-to book if you are trying to apply PM techniques to improve your project office or your own projects. It's odd; as a text, this book rates poorly.  But as a reference guide, it does better -- hence, the 3 star rating.  I recommend this as an item to own, just don't try to curl up for a good night's reading with it.
