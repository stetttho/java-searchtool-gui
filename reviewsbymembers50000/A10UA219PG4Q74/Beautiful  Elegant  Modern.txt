 I've owned my Movado Moderno watch for decades. It is incredibly thin - its a shame that thinness isn't a data point listed in the product description. My watch has stood up to daily wearing and still works great.  Who would want a watch like this? Someone who enjoys wearing crisp, elegant, and design-savvy clothes. Someone who decorates their home in sleek but beautiful furnishings. Someone who always wears black. Someone who loves great watches.  ...or someone who just enjoys a simple and perfect design.  Someone who really needs to see numbers on the face, or someone who likes to have highly specific times won't be happy with this watch, as there are no numerals and exact timing is impossible.   I love my Movado and you will love yours.
