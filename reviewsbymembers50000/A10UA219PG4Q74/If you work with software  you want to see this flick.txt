 I'm a real fan of classic movies as you can tell from some of my other reviews.  Mr. Blandings Build His Dream House makes a great analogy for systems and software development.  Even though this film hit the street in 1948, the situations in which the Blandings find themselves is relevant for any project today.  This story of a man who wishs to fulfill his life dream of ruling his estate in the country contains almost every gotcha ever seen on a project:  - Scope changes - Conflicting executive sponsorship - Changes, Changes control, and the cost of change - Conflicting goals - Users who want it all for almost nothing - Poor project planning  My favourite scene is when Mr. and Mrs. Blandings grab some pencils and start 'tweaking' the architect's drawings.    This film was remade as 'The Money Pit', but I wouldn't recommend that version.  This film will be remade again in 2005 and I doubt it could live up to the tempered choas shown by Cary Grant nor the calm, straigt faced comedy of Myrna Loy.  If you see this film you won't regret it.  If you buy it you will watch it often
