 Every iPAQ user I know either goes naked with the iPAQ (no sleeve at all) or used one of the *functioning* expansion packs like the phone, PC Card, or CF packs. While these style packs come in funky (sort of funky) colours, they don't do anything, not even protect the screen.  If you really, really want one, I suggest that you either spray paint the black one that came with your iPAQ, or, for less expense, glue some dollar bills to your old case.  Now that would be funky. At one tenth the price that these go for I probably won't buy one.  At full price, there's just no value.
