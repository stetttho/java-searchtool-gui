 How things work, hosted by the University of Virginia Physica department, is part course material and part Q&A about the nature of things and how they work.  I found this website a fun read, just in my spare time, about real world physics -- meaning how physics impacts my day to day life.    Question answered inlude:  - Why must you "shake down" a mercury fever thermometer? I was told by one manufacturer that mercury expands but does not contract. Also, is it true that the rounded glass acts as a magnifier because the bore is so small?  - Why are physicists so skeptical about peoples' claims to have invented motors that provide mechanical power without consuming electric power or generators that produce electric power without consuming mechanical power from the systems that turns them?  -Why is it easy to stay on a bike while moving, but impossible once it stops?  -Which is more economical: operating our air conditioner at 75 F or operating it at 78 F and putting fans in front of the vents?  The answers are provided in an easy to understand manner, which is especially important to me, as I've never take a physics class.  This site would be a great resource for teachers and students.
