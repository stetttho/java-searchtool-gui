 So you got the cradle with your iPAQ...great. Now pack that cradle and its cords in your briefcase....see what I mean? The cradle takes up more room than the iPAQ. I grabbed one of these cables after my first trip with the cradle. I was worried that the cradle would be damaged enroute. The cable is very sturdy and takes up a fraction of the space of the cradle.  The whole theory of the Pocket PC is ultra portability; this items keeps it that way. Do you have Windows NT?  You'll want this connector over the USB connnector since Windows NT does not support USB. Want to connect your cell phone to your iPAQ via a cable?  Most cell phone manufactures provide cables that will only hook up via a serial connnection.  You'll need some other items such as a null adapter and a gender bender, but if you have those and this cable, you'll be set to surf, check e-mail, instant message, etc. with your iPAQ.
