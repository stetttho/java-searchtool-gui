 Grab this expansion pack and the largest Compact Flash card you can afford and turn your iPAQ into your dream PDA. With all the new software, movies, music, and toys available for the Pocket PC, you'll soon find that the 32 megs that comes with the iPAQ is inadequate.  Heck, just a couple of songs encoded at a high bitrate can fill your base memory. I purchased this along with a 128 meg Compact Flash card and now I can fit music, whole films, tech manuals, all kinds of good stuff that I would never have been able to do without it.
