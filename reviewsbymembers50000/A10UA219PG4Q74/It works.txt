 This The Plantronics PLX-400 Hands-free headset is a stand-alone telephone.  It's not just something that you have to hook up to another phone.  Just plug it into your phone jack and dial away. It has a volume adjuster, but it must always be set to 9 (the highest setting) and even then it is difficult to hear callers unless I'm in a quiet room. There's a redial button, but no memory or phone book features, so each call must be dialed manually.  This device also includes a flash button for using call waiting or other phone company features that require a quick tap on the 'hook'.  A mute button rounds out all the features of this item. The headset is funtional, but it squeaks a lot if you move around any. The microphone, on a short (~4 inch) boom, works well. This item has the bare minimum of features, lacking many that even the cheapes phones sets offer. Next time, I'll look for phone number memory, call display, etc. before purchasing a handsfree phone.
