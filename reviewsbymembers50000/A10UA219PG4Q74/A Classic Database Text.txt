 Whether or not you support or practice IDEF 1X as your data modelling  religion (after all, it WAS developed for the military), Tom Bruce's 1991  edition can increase the effectiveness of your data modelling by giving you  the opportunity to examine your beliefs and standards.  This text covers  topics from introductory information modelling concepts , normalization,  and reverse engineering, to more advanced data modelling issues. Mr.  Bruce's text also includes chapters on conducting modelling sessions, John  Zachman's Framework, setting up Data Administration functions within your  organization, CASE tools and the IBM Repository (this section is obsolete,  of course), a case study, and review exercises with answers.  Best suited  for those who have participated in IRM activities and wish to build on that  experience. Seasoned IRM practictioners will probably skip the introductory  material and head right to the sections on abstractions, resolution of  typical data modelling issues, and other advanced topics. Even though  "Design" is used in the title, this text is weak on database  design topics.  This text is a good one to have on hand when you're  looking for justification of following a specific data modelling approach  or technique.
