 Some folks here have posted about quality control problems with the iPAQ 36xx series.  There were some problems with units that shipped early after the release of this product.  However, Compaq has been doing a great job of addressing the concerns.  They have also been replacing units that suffer the worst problems (screen flipping, power button issues). They have also been offering refunds to those who are not satisfied. I've had mine for 6 months and haven't had these problems. I'm happy with my device. It's a lot easier to use on a plane than my laptop, I can check my e-mail in just a couple of minutes, I can browse full websites (not clips) wirelessly. Can your Palm do that?
