 Unlike many Hollywood works, this sequel to the Practical SQL Handbook (that I have also reviewed here) manages to improve upon the previous title. The title of this work, with its pun (SQL/Sequel), is a great indicator that Bowman can write about a potentially dry topic while interjecting many grins throughout.  I really appreciated that touch. One feature of this work that I especially liked is that it is organized by problem type (Managing Multiples) rather than by syntax (SELECT).  This, in my opinion, is key to a book with the word 'Practical' in the title.  Overall the presentation (layout, font, figures, etc.) is somewhat mundane; however, this does not take away from quality of the work. The sequel also includes a CD with an evaluation copy of Sybase Adaptive Server Anware and a working database, ready for you to use in working through the problems and solutions presented.  Unlike many technical works, I found no errors in the problems or solutions presented.  The sequel includes chapters on: - Handling Dirty Data - Translating Values - Managing Multiples - Navigating Numbers - Tuning Queries - Using SQL to Write SQL - Understanding the Sample Database - Comparing Data Type and Functions - Using Resources. Another feature that I enjoy is the fact that while the work presents standard SQL information, Bowman includes DBMS-specific variations (Sybase Adaptive Server, Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise, MS SQL Server, Oracle, and Informix), albeit without includin one major DBMS, DB2.  The missing DBMS is the reason I rate this work a 4 instead of a 5. I recommend this work to those that work with SQL or databases in general.
