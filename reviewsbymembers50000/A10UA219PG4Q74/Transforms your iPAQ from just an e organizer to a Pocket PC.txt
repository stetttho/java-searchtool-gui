 Until I received my iPAQ Compact Flash Expansion Pack, my iPAQ was just another pretty electronic organizer. I had to carefully choose each and every program and move data on and off the iPAQ just as I needed it. Now I have the CF Expansion Pack and several Viking CF cards, a couple of at least 128 megs.  I can install whole films on one of these cards, plus carry around songs, documents, games...well, just about anything. Since CF cards draw minimal energy from the battery, they can be used for hours.  Since they don't have any moving parts, they can survive the usually bumps and grinds of my day.  Also, since this supports any CF card, I can share these incredible cards with my digital camera.  That means I get double duty out of every card. The one drawback for this pack is that it does not have a second battery like the PC Card Expansion pack.  However, it's this configuration that allows the CF pack to be half as thick as the PC Card pack. I also use this expansion pack with a CF modem that allows me to dial in to get e-mail, surf, and do remote support where ever there's a phone. Vendors are coming with additional CF devices like wireless network cards and projector interfaces, so there will be more things to easily add to your iPAQ with this pack.
