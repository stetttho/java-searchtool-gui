 This book reflects the input of hundreds of other consultants and contractors around the world.  If you use just one of any of the recommendations in this book you will earn back many times it's cost. If  you work through brokers or other agents, it's very likely that this book  will save you thousands of dollars on your next contract. Ever wonder  what all those contract clauses mean to your bottom line?  Janet will show  you.  Ever wonder if you really need a formal contract?  Ever question your  broker's motives?  Ever worry that you might be reclassified as an employee  by the IRS? Janet will help you with just about every curveball they can  throw. This work also includes a good sample contract that protects your  interest.  You still need a lawyer for each instance, but you can now go to  the negotiating table much more informed, in a much more powerful  position. It's worth it to pick up Janet's other works, too.
