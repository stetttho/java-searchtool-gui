 While the title may sound a little flat, it describes prefectly the content between the covers, often a rare treat in the hyped-up technical book sector. This work is a wonderful introduction to standard SQL, presented in a platform-independent method that is appropriate for  introductory texts. The section on DBMS-specific syntax makes the generic  descriptions usable in the real world, so even though you will be learning  basic SQL, you will be able to use this knowledge from day one. I highly  recommend this to new SQLers.
