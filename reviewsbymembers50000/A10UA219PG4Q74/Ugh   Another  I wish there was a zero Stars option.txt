 Compaq does not recommend using adhesive protectors like these on the iPAQ.  The adhesive can ruin the touch sensitive layer on the screen.  Using these may cost you hundreds of dollars to have the screen replaced as Compaq does not repair screens -- they just replace them. Also, these protectors really don't look or feel good on the iPAQ.  It would take most people 10-15 applications for them to get it so that there are no bubbles or streaks. By that time, your screen may be ruined. You are much better off using transparencies cut to size or another brand of protector that does not use adhesive. Beware.
