 Please read my full review below.  This review answers questions posted in other reviews here. CF cards don't really impact battery life any more than using the regular memory of the iPAQ. That's because they don't have any moving parts to put extra stress on the battery. One exception is the IBM Microdrive. This is a tiny hard drive in a CF format. Because it spins just like the hard drive on your PC, it does eat battery life. I recommend that if you want to use the IBM Microdrive, use a PC card expansion pack with a CF adaptor because the expansion pack has an extra batter.
