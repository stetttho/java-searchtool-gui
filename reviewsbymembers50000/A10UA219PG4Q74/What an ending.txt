 As I eagerly awaited this release, I worried that my expectations would  exceed what Tom Harris would deliver.  I was not disappointed. As the  title indicates, this work is much more focused on Hannibal Lector than  Harris's previous works. I found the imagry engaging and beautiful. The  ending will definitly surprise, shock, and dismay you, but it was much more  interesting than the traditional Hollywood ending.  It makes one question  what really motivates us and how one's belief system is impacted by those  around us. Ever think you'd see Hannibal as the protaganist?  You just  may do so here, if only for the fact that you will have to choose him over  greater evils.
