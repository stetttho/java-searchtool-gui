 Previously I owned a 4-port hub that I used to share a Cable modem with 3 computers.  This meant mucking with configuration changes to each machine and also waiting on my ISP to set up multiple IP addresses for these extra machines to use.  Even then my ISP consistently managed to forget to provide those IP addresses (sort of like 'keys' to connect to the internet) and my other computers would be down for couple of days while my ISP got around to fixing the problem. I was concerned that setting up a router would be much more difficult than just plugging in a hub.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the installation instructions were easy to follow and worked well. The software provided to configure this product is HTML-based, which means that if you know how to surf, you know this software. In addition to allowing you to share one internet connection amongst many computers, this router also offers features to make is work like a firewall (something that helps keep hackers out of your computers). On other benefit that isn't emphasized enough is that via Windows, you will be able to set up your new network to share printers, scanners, hard drives, etc. I use this product with desktops, laptops, and my Pocket PC and all worked well. Be sure that you check with your ISP to see if using a router to share your connection is covered by your agreement.  Also, if you ever need to get techical support from your ISP, you'll need to first bypass this router as most ISPs will want to ensure that the problem isn't with your new network.
