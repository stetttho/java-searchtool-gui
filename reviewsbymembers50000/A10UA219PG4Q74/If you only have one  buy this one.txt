 I have a very eclectic ear when it comes to music an am currently on an Asian Chillout collecting binge.  I'm sometimes asked by friends who hear my tunes, what would be a good CD to buy just to hear some good Indian/Asian music.  I always recommend Asian Groove.  I find the songs on this CD the closest to 'crossover' music for those more comfortable with North American music tastes.  Perhaps previous reviewers that have panned this work due to its closeness to an American style aren't looking that type of CD.  But I'm guessing that most Amazon surfers are.  I highly recommend this CD for those who want to buy their first (and sometimes, only) Hindi CD.  Personally, I love the Destiny's Child samples, as well as Noorie, by Bally Sagoo.
