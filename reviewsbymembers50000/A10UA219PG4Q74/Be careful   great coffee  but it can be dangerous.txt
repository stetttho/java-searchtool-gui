 I've used a Bodum French Press coffee maker for over 10 years. I love the taste of the coffee these beautiful devices make.   However, after years of successfully making coffee, I had a bad experience. I filled the beaker with boiling water, waited for the coffee to brew, then I began to push down on the strainer, it caught a bit, then plunged down rapidly. Because the pour spout was pointed toward me, boiling coffee spewed over the front of my body. I had second degree burns. It was a painful and entirely avoidable incident. Everything healed fine, though  Be careful while pushing down the plunger. Make certain that the spout is pointed away from you or anyone else. If the plunger gets to the point where it is tougher to push down, replace it. Don't push down the plunger until the coffee has cooled enough to make it safe. Don't let children push the plunger.   I would love to have another one of these, but I'm a bit afraid. Just be careful and pay attention.
