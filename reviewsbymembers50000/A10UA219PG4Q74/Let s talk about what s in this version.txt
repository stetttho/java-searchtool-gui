 This DVD is the one that is going to get you to buy a DVD player. The film is a wonderful work.  I wouldn't have thought that I would be calling a 'horror' flick beautiful, but it is. The DVD contains a wealth of  additional material that will make you want to go back and watch the film  again as soon as you see it.  The multiple commentaries allowed me to see  the the things I had missed or not fully appreciated the first time  around. Most DVDs contain sparse extras -- this one has the extras that  justify the additional cost of a DVD over VHS.
