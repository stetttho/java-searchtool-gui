 I have used both Outlook and Organizer for several years.  Organizer far outpaces MS Outlook if you are a very organized person (or dream of being so).  I especially like Organizer's use of colour and icons to help you  scan entries.  I can't believe that MS is still stuck in a black and white  world with Outlook. I also make extensive use of Organizer's ability to  cross link different types of entries. For instance: I can create a To Do  for making a phone call next week.  I can have Organizer create a calendar  entry for that call automatically and have it linked to a contact in my  address book.  No searching for a phone number at the last minute. The  ability to publish both calendar and address book information to a website  is very helpful as I travel. The one disappointing drawback is that  Calendar web publishing does not include full day events (planner entries),  making calendar publishing useless unless I want to create duplicate  all-day appointments.  As soon as Lotus realizes and corrects this bug, I  will have to manually list events on the same website.
