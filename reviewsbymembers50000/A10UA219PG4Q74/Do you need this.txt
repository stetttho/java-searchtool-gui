 This expansion pack for the Compaq iPAQ Pocket PC will extend the features of your iPAQ -- taking it from the toy catetory to a productivity tool.   You will need this accessory if you want to: - Use the PC Cards you currently own, such as a modem, ethernet card, wireless card, cell phone modem, barcode scanner, etc. - Have the only device currently available that includes additional battery power. The iPAQ has a non-removable battery. This is the only way to add battery to the iPAQ, short of building your own batter extender and lugging it around.  The extra battery is required to support the power needs of a PC Card. This expansion pack is bigger than the compact flash expansion pack -- it adds 3.5cm thickness and 132 grams of weight to your iPAQ, more than doubling its thickness. You want this if you currently have PC cards that you'd like to use with or iPAQ or if there is a card that you want to use (such as a wireless one) that is not available in Compact Flash format.
