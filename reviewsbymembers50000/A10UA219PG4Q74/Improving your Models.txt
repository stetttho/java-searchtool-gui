 This book is not a database book, nor does it try to be that. For anyone  who understands the role of logical data modelling, this book will prove to  be a valuable addition to your professional bookshelf. It is filled with  detailed examples of good & bad models, along with analyses that list  the pros & cons of each approach. I'd recommend this to any intelligent  professional who is moving into the data architect role, along with  experienced modellers who are looking for analyses of data modelling  implications.
