 A Fine Balance was my first experience reading Mistry's works.  From the very beginning I found myself tied to the characters - I wanted to know more about them, even though I felt I had little in common with them. The only other work set in India that I had read was _Life of Pi_.  While I enjoyed that read, it didn't do much to expose me to the day-to-day struggles of Balance's characters from different castes. I have to say, though, that what affected me most about this work was how it was drawn to a close.  The ending will stick with me for a long time.  Now, when I use the phrase "It's a fine balance", I know that our lives are precariously balanced, much like the circus child depicted on the cover. My recommendation is to read this work, then immediately read Mistry's _Family Matters_ to get a different view into Mistry's view of Indian culture. I also recommend that you take the time to look up the various Hindi words and names sprinkled throughout this work.   Karen
