 So you got the cradle with your iPAQ...great. Now pack that cradle and its cords in your briefcase....see what I mean? The cradle takes up more room than the iPAQ. I grabbed one of these cables after my first trip with the cradle. I was worried that the cradle would be damaged enroute. The cable is very sturdy and takes up a fraction of the space of the cradle. This cable is about 3.5 feet long, plenty of length to go from a CPU under your desk to the desktop. You will need to carry this cable and the charger for your trips, but it's easier than carrying the bulky USB cradle. The whole theory of the Pocket PC is ultra portability; this items keeps it that way.
