 I'm a huge Bryson fan, expecially given my total lack of talent when writing.  So I was completely disappointed to read so may mistakes in the first 10 pages of  _The Mother Tongue_.  How did this get past an editor?    I'm certain that there must be some really great stuff in the middle of the book, but since there were so many errors in the beginning, I had to take ever single fact with a grain of salt.  For the record:  - The French language can indeed make a distinction between "I wrote" and "I have written" (page 13 - the book starts on page 11, BTW)  - There are not 50 (or any other huge number) for snow in Inuit languages -- and why did he use the word "Eskimo"? (Page 14)   The chapter on swearing was interesting, but failed to tie in well with the rest of the book.  Take anything your read in the book with suspicion.
