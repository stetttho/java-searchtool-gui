 The iPAQ will not work with Cardbus PC Cards. They will fit in the expansion pack, but they will not work. The battery in the expansion pack has been reviewed on several sites in great detail. Check out Brighthand and PocketPCPassion for in depth battery tests as well as reviews. This pack doesn't really work well as an additional battery for your iPAQ. However, it will keep your iPAQ alive if they main battery is low. That means that you should have your iPAQ turned OFF, letting this battery keep your content alive.
