 I recently purchased this product to use with my office wireless LAN.  It works, technically, however, its range is vastly inferior to other Wireless LAN cards I own.  Connection speeds drop off a great deal within 5 meters of the access point. Connection quality drops to Poor in just 10 meters with only one standard wall. If this product were half the price, it might be worth it for computers that are permanently located withing a meter or two of an access point. I don't recommend this product for moving Ad Hoc (computer-to-computer) connections.
