 A re-pub of a previous work, the adventure that Arch Carroll takes us on is thrilling and fast, but not nearly has engaging as Alex Cross's feats.  I wasn't sure who I wanted to success here because I didn't have a good understanding of what motivated the characters.  I attribute the lack of  character development to very short chapters (some fewer than 3 pages) and  the need to focus on getting everyone into the sack as soon as possible.   If you are a Patterson fan, then by all means purchase this book.  If not,  then you would be better off choosing one of his later works.
