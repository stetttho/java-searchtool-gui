 The description of this product here is not clear and has led to folks purchasing this for the newer Windows CE devices and being disappointed, which I can see would be easy to do. This software works with older Windows CE products, but not newer ones such as Pocket PC or Windows CE 3.0 for Handhelds such as the HP 720. Windows CE products must be compiled (built) separately for each processor used by a device.  For instance, software for Pocket PCs must come in three flavours (ARM, MIPS, SH3) today...However, ARM and StrongARM processors did not exist when this product was made, so there is no installation in ARM devices (such as the Compaq iPAQ). When you purchase Windows CE software, you must verify that it includes a version for the processor and operating system of your device. I wish Amazon would list this type of information in their catalog.
