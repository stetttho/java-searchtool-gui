 We iPAQ users have been waiting a while for this keyboard and now that it's here, I can imagine how I worked without it. My first impression of it was how it stores (folded).  The folded keyboard is rock solid -- it doesn't need a case unless you are concerned with scratches to the finish. It is about the same size at the iPAQ. The package comes with an 'L' shaped adaptor so that you can charge your iPAQ while it sits on the keyboard.  It also comes with a small instruction booklet and a CD.  You install the CD on your desktop or laptop, then sync your PDA to to install the software. Unfolded, the keyboard is much more 'real' feeling than I thought is was going to be.  There are dedicated keys for Pocket PC specific apps like Word, Inbox, Excel, Contacts, etc.  The keyboard is about the same size as my laptop keyboard, with nearly the same feel. On problem I did notice was that there is a sharp edge where my wrists rest, but I will try to sand or cover it in the near future. Some things that keep this from getting 5 starts (but I really wanted to give it 5 five stars): - The connection REQUIRES the iPAQ to be in portrait mode, so no using a landscape utility to work with (unless you are really good reading sideways) - The keyboard requires a solid flat surface.  If they had included some sort of bar or other device that would lock the center hinge, it would work much better on a softer or uneven surface (like your lap or a bed). - You still have to use the stylus quite a bit on menus and dialog boxes.  For a touch typist, this is a pain. Being a touch typist, my input speeds are probably 3-5 times what they were with transcriber and about 7 times faster than the virtual keyboard. I use this mainly in places where my laptop won't fit such as an airplane seat or in meetings where I want to be a bit more discreet (although it gets a lot of attention). As I said, I can't imagine going without this device.  A real engineering feat.
