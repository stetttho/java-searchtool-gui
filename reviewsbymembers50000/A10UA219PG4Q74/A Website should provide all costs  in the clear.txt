 We signed up for Vonage as a trial to see if VOIP services fit our needs.  Sign up was easy and our modem arrived quickly.  We signed up for the unlimited plan, as we thought we'd be using our second line quite a bit.  However, as it turned out, we didn't use very many minutes, so we decided to switch to the limited calling plan, as well as, since the trial had gone well, to have our second land line number used on our Vonage line, then cancell the second land line with Bell Canada.  I was happy to find out that I could switch our number and the Vonage would 'take care of the paperwork' to get our number over to the Vonaga line.  I was also happy that we could change plans online, without having to speak to a customer service rep.  As I logged in and made these two changes, I found out the true cost of doing my own data maintenance on this service -- A nearly tenner charge for each change we made.  So two tenners down the drain in the first month, just for changing plans and using number portability.  Digging deeper, I find out that if we decided to cancel our service, it will be 5 of those tenners just to stop being a customer.  Of course, these Vonage folks can charge whatever they want - it's a free market.  But the website people could do a much better job of highlight the true cost of this service.  A tenner just to change a code in the database.  That's half a month's service charge.
