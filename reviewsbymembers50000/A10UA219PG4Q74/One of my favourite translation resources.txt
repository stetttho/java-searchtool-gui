 Ocassionally our discussion groups receive posts in foreign languages.  We actually do OK on our own with those in Spanish, French, and a bit of Hindi.  However, when we have to moderate messages in Dutch or Russian, we can't read them.    So I usually head over to World Lingo to get a reliable translation.  Of course, no machine translation can match the wits and skills of a seasoned human translator, but World Lingo fits our needs, perfectly -- well, nearly perfectly.  Translations on World Lingo do a good job of allowing us to understand the nature of the post and whether it meets our posting guidelines.  Only 4 stars here because I'd love to see more languages supported.  Overall, though, a wonderful free resource for those of us working in an international IT sector.
