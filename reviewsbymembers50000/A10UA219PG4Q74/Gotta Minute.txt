 The One Minute Methodology is a very brief tale of a young man's search for the ultimate systems development methodology. He hooks up with the One Minute Methodology Man who shows him the miracles he performs with his One Minute Methodology - making management happy with its 60-second idea-to-implementation scheme. Ten second requirements, 10 second implementation, and other methods that you, too, can use and get the same results.   ...or do you want them?  Ken Orr tells his story in parable form, which should only take you 15 to 30 minutes to read. Although this text is brief, he hits the nail on the head with this statement from a more realistic methodman:   "...there is a kind of game that goes on to convince top management that they can really have anything they want, if only we replace thinking and planning with hardware and software and radical new management techniques."    Target Audience: The real audience for this should be top management; however, it will be owned by project leaders, data architects, and quality assurance analysts.   Pros: It's a quick read    Cons: It's a quick read    Final Rating: 7 out of 10
