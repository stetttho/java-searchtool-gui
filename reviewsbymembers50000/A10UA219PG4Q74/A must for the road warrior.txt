 So you got the cradle with your iPAQ...great.  Now pack that cradle and its cords in your briefcase....see what I mean?  The cradle takes up more room than the iPAQ. I grabbed one of these cables after my first trip with the cradle.  I was worried that the cradle would be damaged enroute.  The cable is very sturdy and takes up a fraction of the space of the cradle.   The whole theory of the Pocket PC is ultra portability; this items keeps it that way.
