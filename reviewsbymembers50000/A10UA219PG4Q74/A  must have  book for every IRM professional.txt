 The chapters on estimating your organization's cost of having non-quality data make this book a requirement for every Information Resource Management  professional's book shelf. Larry English is one of the few authors in the  industry to show you how to work the numbers when it comes to data quality.   While others drop hints at why quality is good, Mr. English tells us how  to collect the data and how to calculate the true costs of sub-standard  data management practices. As our profession matures we will be called  upon to make more explicit business cases for what we recommend to senior  management -- Larry has some great methods for us to use.  This will save  us months of having to figure it out for ourselves.
