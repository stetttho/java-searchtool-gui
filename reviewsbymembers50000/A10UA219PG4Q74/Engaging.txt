 It's always a treat to read a truly engaging work that leaves me wanting an even longer glimpse at the characters.  I didn't know how Irving was going to take me into the lives of these characters without depressing me.  Yet he did, and did so in a way that left me feeling calm.  This book has  been a great change of pace from my normal mass market work.   I also  have not seen the film and worry that when I do, I will be disappointed  more than usual...I can't imagine how a screenplay can begin to delve into  the lives of these complex characters without losing the srongest portion  of the story.
