 Laplink has saved me several times and paid for itself many times over. If you have a laptop, I'd bet you've left a file you're working on at home or at work. You intended to take it with you, but in your haste to leave you forgot it. If you had Laplink and a modem or lan connection you could have it at your fingertips in a matter of minutes. The file transfer facility is intuitive and fast. However, the best feature is remote contol. This allows you to login to another PC that also has Laplink running and work as if you were sitting right at the keyboard of that PC.  Have you ever tried to walk a new PC user through some problem they are having and been frustrated by trying to explain the difference between a button and tab or a link? With Laplink you don't have to go through that. You can "walk them through it" right from your own keyboard. Using the online-chat feature along with the remote contol, you can solve their problem in what used to take hours of "if it weren't so sad it would be funny" type blind walkthroughs. I've used PC Anywhere, but really prefer Laplink for its feature set and ease of use. Even though it is named Laplink, you don't need a laptop to enjoy the features of Laplink. If you regularly use more than one non-connected PC, you need Laplink.
