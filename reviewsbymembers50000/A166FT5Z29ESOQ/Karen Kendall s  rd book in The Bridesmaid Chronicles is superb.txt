 Karen Kendall's 3rd book in The Bridesmaid Chronicles is superb! I read it in record time because I just didn't want to put it down. If you read Karen's first book in this series, you will absolutely love First Dance.  In First Dance, Manhattan's top female divorce attorney, Vivien, heads to Texas in the hopes of getting her bride-to-be best friend to sign a pre-nup (her idea of a great wedding present). But, she soon finds out that one of the groomsmen (also a lawyer) is deadset against a pre-nup, plus he is itching for a fight, in particular one with Vivien. A woman he was involved with in the past and has a score to settle, or will his heart take over and lead him to something else?  Additional novels in the collection include: First Date by Karen Kendall, First Kiss by Kylie Adams and First Love by Julie Kenner.
