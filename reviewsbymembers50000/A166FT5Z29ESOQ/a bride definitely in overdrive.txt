 Bride in Overdrive is a diary of author Jorie Green Mark's Path toward Marriage. The reader gets to learn her inner-most thoughts and share her encounters with pre-marital brattiness. Her anticipation for the worst case scenario is combined with comedic overtones. It is not just herself trying to plan a marvelous wedding. Her story includes her best friends and extended family members and also an extraordinarily wonderful future mother and father- in- law. All contribute to fulfill her most lovely wedding day. The author does seem to possess a conceitedness about getting her own way - which at times she unabashedly admits.
