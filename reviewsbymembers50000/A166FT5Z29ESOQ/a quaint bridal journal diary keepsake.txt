 Bridal Shower Memories is a quaint bridal journal/diary keepsake for the engaged gal. There is a charming story about the history of the bridal shower to start you off. Plenty of space to write down guests names and addresses, gifts and more. For years to come, you'll have fun reading words of advice from those attending. Bring this journal out again to share with your own grown children when they decide to wed.
