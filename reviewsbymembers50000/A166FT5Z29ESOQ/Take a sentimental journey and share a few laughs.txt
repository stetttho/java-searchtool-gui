 This book is for any mother of a bride, past, present or future. Somewhere, in this diary of sorts, you will find a similar connection with author Leslie Milk's own experience with her daughter's wedding from engagement to reception party. She also writes other mother-of- the bride stories along with tips and suggestions to switch to plan B when Plan A doesn't seem to be working. The reality checks at the end of each short chapter could have been omitted as they just didn't tickle this reviewers funny bone. Makes a nice gift for any mother or surrogate mother of the bride.
