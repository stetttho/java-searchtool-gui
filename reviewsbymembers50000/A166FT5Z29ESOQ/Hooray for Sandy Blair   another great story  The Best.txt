 Sandy Blair's The Accidental Duchess is one of 3 novellas in the anthology How To Marry a Duke. You know a story is going to be a good one when the author has you hooked by the 2nd page. And Sandy Blair did just that in The Accidental Duchess, just as she had done in her novel A Rogue in a Kilt - which I recently finished reading and also highly recommend.  In The Accidental Duchess, Rachael, a destitute governess, find shelter in what appears to be a townhouse that has been left unoccupied for the winter months. But, when the owner, Connor, the eighth Duke of Kilgory, returns and finds Rachael asleep in his bed - the story quickly grabs your interest even more. It's guaranteed you won't want to stop reading until you've finished the story. Sorry, I can't say anymore, you'll have to grab a copy of the book and find out what makes Sandy Blair's writing style so special and unique.  The two other novellas in this anthology are To Woo a Duke by Debbie Raleigh and A Touch of Magic by Regan Allen.
