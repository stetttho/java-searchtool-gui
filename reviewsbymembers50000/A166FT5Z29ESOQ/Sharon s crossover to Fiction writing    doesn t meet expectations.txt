In It's My Wedding TOO, by Sharon Naylor, yes, the one and the same Sharon Naylor, who has written for you so many wonderful wedding idea and guide books, writes her first fiction story. What an incredible story she weaves for her bride-to-be, Emilie. Emilie needs her caring and nuturing mother to resurface and be the woman Emilie remembers. But, years ago, her mother had transformed into the now influential romance novelist and world renowned Delilah Winchester (formerly Donna Penks), and has her own ideas as to how Emilie and Anthony's wedding should be. Meanwhile, Anthony's mother, homemaker extraordinare', Carmela, has her perceptions regarding her precious son's day. Conflicts ensue, including an outrageous dress fight that erupts between the two mother's at a designer's salon in NYC.  Author Sharon Naylor conjures up circumstances with every turn of the page.
