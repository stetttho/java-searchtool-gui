 This is one book you won't want to put down. Where Two Seas Met is a beautifully written historical romance novel by a father/daughter writing team (Gilbert and Lynn Morris). The authors' descriptive and intriguing writing style will capture your heart and make you believe that no matter what obstacles you may come across, there is always a "happily ever after". While reading Where Two Seas Met, you will feel like you stepped back into history and are right there with the characters. And you will fall in love with the strong-willed Cheney and ever-supporting Shiloh. Look for the "Continuing Saga of the Much-Loved Cheney and Shiloh Series" to be released in April 2004. This is one novel I am eagerly awaiting.
