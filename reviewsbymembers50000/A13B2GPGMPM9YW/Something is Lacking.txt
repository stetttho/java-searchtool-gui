 I adore the voice of Toni Braxton, but the songs that she has selected for The Heat left me a bit chilled.  Of course there are a few gems on this CD that will no doubt make it to the top ten and probably carry the CD to  platinum status.  As far as a good follow up for Secrets, this work is  definately lacking.
