 Jill Scott's first album is tight....and if you have the chance to see this young lady live NOT PASS UP THE CHANCE.  I saw her recently here in the A-T-L aka Atlanta and the girl was off the hook!  Her live performance will leave even the most jaded of concert goers in total and complete awe.  Her voice is brilliant, but more importantly, it doesn't betray her insighful lyrics and incredible poetry. Ms. Scott let's the audience know that she is first and foremost a poet.  Her love of words, rythms and rhyme is impossible to hide. Who is Jill Scott?  Well, she is a passionate African-American woman intent on making the world a better place through her art.
