 Nien Cheng's novel is greatest autobiography that I have ever read.  Since reading this novel over 10 years ago, I am still moved by the God given courage this incredible woman posseses.  Few individuals could have endured  the cruelities bestowed upon her by the sick political turmoil of Cultural  Revolutionary China.  Despite deaths, torture and unthinkable isolation her  spirit endured.  I love to meet Ms. Cheng.  I understand that she's now an  American citizen and lives in Washington, DC.  I would feel humbled and  blessed at occasion. By all means read this book.....you will gain more  than you could ever imagine.
