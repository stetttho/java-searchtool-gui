 ...it really is a shame that so much talent and incredible music never reaches the masses because a group is not sexy enough, didn't have a record deal or refused to sell their souls to some unethical greedy executive.  Rubygrass's Fireflies is a supberb CD and unfortunately the group is no longer together.  They are talented and the lead singer has such a gifted voice.  On the tunes "New Orleans"  "Fireflies"  and "If You Loved Me" her voice will leave in awe.  I hope that this group gets back together or that the world changes so that groups and people with true talent can make a living by playing the music that they love.
