 Farai Chideya has written a very honest account of what she feels the future holds for this country and race.  She travelled America and met with a diversre spectrum of young people and allowed their voices to be heard via this book.  In many ways this text reads like an on going report or newspaper article and I feel that this format serves Ms. Chideya well. Here in Atlanta the signs of a multicultural America are abundant.  Afro-Americans, Whites, Southerns, Asian, Caribbeans, Jews and a host of other people now populate this once southern strong.  This diversity has made all of our live richer and better.  Ms. Chideya's book is reflection of this reality.  The Color of our Future is Now.
