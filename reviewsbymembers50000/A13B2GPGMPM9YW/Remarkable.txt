 In this day of manufactured pop & MTV, Macy Gray sticks out like a sore thumb. She is talented, original and unparalleled in her ability to supercede critics and the media.  I stood spellbound for over 2 hrs this  spring when I saw her here in Atlanta.  She was down-home-funky and  captivating on stage with music that was off the hook.  Ignore the critics  and lack of air play.  Listen to the masses and by the infectious CD.
