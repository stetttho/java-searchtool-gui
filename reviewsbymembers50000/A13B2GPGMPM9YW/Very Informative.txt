 Having been fascinated with Black Creole culture and the history of French New Orleans, I found this book to be very informative.  I was unaware of the large free mulatto class of people that existed in French New Orleans.  I thought that most of these people simply resulted from forced sexual liasons between French men and Black women, as in the South. In New Orleans that was not the case. This is a very insightful read about a group of people that history speaks very little of.  I encourage you to read it.
