 I found Mah's memoir to be absolutely fascinating. I am slow reader and burned through this book in a day. I was deeply impressed how she overcame her dysfunctional manipulative family. The ending left me wondering how she feels about her family now. In addition, she did not speak about her relationship with her children to any great degree. I would have liked to have known more. At any rate, I found this to be an excellent testiment. Perfect for a long rainy day.
