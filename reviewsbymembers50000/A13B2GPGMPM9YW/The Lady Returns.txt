 ....I Love this CD.  On Lovers Rock Sade does what Sade does best.  She takes the listner through the journery of loves highs and lows.  Her voice is rich and mature.  Her lyrics are thoughful and provoling.  "King of Sorrow"  "Flow" and "Lovers Rock" are standout tunes that will satisfy anyone who dares to listen.   This CD is refreshing.  It standouts amongst those who pretend to make music.
