 I really enjoyed reading "The Sweeter the Juice."  Ms. Haizlip's story of her mother's family passing for white was fascinating and disturbing all at once.  I could never imagaine denying myself and my own  family in order to be accepted by the white world.  I am glad that in the  end that family came back together.  And that her cousins that had no  knowledge of their own Black ancestry were so accepting of it.  Blood  really is thicker than water....
