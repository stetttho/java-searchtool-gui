 "Say Amen Somebody" is about the celebration of life through Gospel music and what a joy it is. I have watched this movie countless times and each time I am moved to tears.  The love for God as expressed through the African American experience is the essence of Gospel music. When life became too large and oppressive Black folk always had Jesus and their cries of sorrow turned to joy in Gospel music.  I firmly believe that Gospel music is not only the roots for Soul and R&B, but it is also the cornerstone of American culture. Every aspect of literature, music, poetry and art has been profoundly influenced by Gospel music. This movie bears clear witness to that. Watch or buy Say Amen Somebody and allow Thomas Doresy and Will Mae Ford to impart God's blessings upon you......
