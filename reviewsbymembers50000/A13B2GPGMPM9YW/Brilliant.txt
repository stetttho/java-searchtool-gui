 ...The authors of the Africana must be appaulled.  Never before have I encountered so much material concering Africans, Afro-Latinos, Afro-Americans, and other Blacks in the Diaspora.  This book should be  bought by all people of African descent and shared with their families.   This encyclodepia is a true treasure.
