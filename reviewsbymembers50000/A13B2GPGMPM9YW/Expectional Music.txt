 I bought this album while in Japan and it was the smartest musical purchase of my life.  The Style Council is a fantastic band and this live performance doesn't miss the mark.  During their hey-day of the 80's this talented British band was over-looked in the States--lost somewhere between New Wave & Wham. Paul Weller and his band made fine music though.  "The Lodgers" and "Internationalists" are my favorite cuts on this exceptional recording.  Funk, R&B and Pop collided and the result was Style Council.  Check them out!
