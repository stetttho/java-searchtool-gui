 I was very sad to learn that Rob Buck of 10,000 Maniacs died on 12/20/00. He was the lead guitarist for this exceptional band and will no doubt be missed in the world of music. ....The album, "In My Tribe" has had a profound impact on my life.  It was here that I first listened to thought-provoking and innovative music that caused me to dwell upon other things besides myself.  From the theme of child abuse in "What's the Matter Here," alcoholism in "Don't Talk" and illiteracy in "Cherry Tree,"  10,000 Maniacs provided me and many other college aged listeners with powerful themes during the mid-80's.  It was also in this album that I was introduced to politically charged and socially conscious music.  Natalie Merchant's magnificent voice was also the perfect medium for the band's lyrics.   It is rare that I listen to a record and find myself instantly mesmerized and speechless.  "In My Tribe" is a piece of work that did just that. It also perfectly captured my mindset, political voice and even to some degree my intellect, during my college years. Rob Buck was an incredible musician. Fortunately his voice will live forever on this signature work.
