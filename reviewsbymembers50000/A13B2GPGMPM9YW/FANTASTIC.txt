 ....I have never been so mesmerized by a single track as I have been with The Dave Mathew Band's Version of the classic "ALONG THE WATCHTOWER!"  The engergy, force and imagination that went into this  live recording has left me at a total lose for words.  As a proud Virginian  I am glad that I claim The Dave Mathew's Band my own.
