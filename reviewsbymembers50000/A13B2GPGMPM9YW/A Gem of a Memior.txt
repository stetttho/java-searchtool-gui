 I bought this book on a whim.  I am not a cyclist nor have I really followed the sport. Inspite of that, I found Lance Armstrong's biography to be incredibly inspiring.  I read it while on a plane coming back from Jamaica and found myself utterly enthralled with his story of self-discovering and growth that gained as a cancer survivor.  I was also moved by the parallels he described in battling the pethelon and conqueoring  cancer.  His love for the bike and what it has brought to his life is equally impressive.  I felt as though I was with him as decribed cycling through harsh weather, pain and all the wonderous nature of the French countyside. Oncology nurse Ms. Latrice Haney, whom he calls a real life angel, was also inspiring. Her dedication to her patient and her profession was moving. If am ever sick, I also hope encounter an angel like her.   Life is miracleous.  Lance Armstrong's testimony bears witness to this fact.
