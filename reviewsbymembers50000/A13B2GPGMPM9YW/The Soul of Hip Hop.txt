 Mos Def is a Hip-Hop artist of unparalleled dimensions.  I had been disenchanted with the state of rap music and hip-hop for sometime and had been longing for a performer that really explored the deeper aspects of Blackness.  I felt that rap & hip-hop had become fixated on anti-female lyrics and the lowest common denominator. ....Then I became acquainted with "Black on Both Sides" by Mos Def. Mos Def has created something original on the record entitled "Black on Both Sides."  This Brotha eloquently raps about Black People, the World and other Social Issues in a very profound manner.  He alternates between rapp'n and sing'n while infusing incredible music to his message....the results are simply out of this world.  The conscious of the Hip-Hop community resides within Mos Def,  an incredible artist and a man to respect.  He wears his Blackness on his sleeve and it shines brightly....
