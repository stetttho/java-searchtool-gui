 Talented is the word that comes to mind when thinking of Nickle Creek.  These precocious wonders display a skilled muscianship that is well beyound their young years and they also sing incredibily sweet harmonies.   "The Lighthouse Tale" is the standout track on this collection and tells beautifully song story of friendship and love. I also admire the richly played celtic and bluegrass arrangements on showcase. I do not normally enjoy instrumentals, but Nickle Creek plays so well that their instruments speak to you. Buy this release....you will not regret it.
