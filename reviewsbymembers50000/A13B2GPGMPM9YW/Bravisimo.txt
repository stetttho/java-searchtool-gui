 Listening to the ethereal voice of Omara Portuondo is a pleasure.  This CD expounds greatly on the Buena Vista Social Club's recordings and showcases Cuba's greatest singer.  Her voice is in the tradition of the great African  American singers such as Sarah Vaughn, Morgana King and Ella Fitzgerald. I  encourage you to sit back and take in every note of her precious voice.   She will take you to another world...
