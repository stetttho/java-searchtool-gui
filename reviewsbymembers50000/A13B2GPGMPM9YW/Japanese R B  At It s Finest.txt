 I bought this CD last summer while spending some time in Shibuya and I have to admit that for as bad as J-Pop can get, Utada Hikaru's CD is very good.  While most Japanese artist hang-out around the edges of R&B, Utada jumps right in!  The Japanese language even lends itself very well to Soul music.  "Automatic" is the stand-out track on this CD, but all of the tunes are full of spunk. Another very good Japanese R&B artist is Suzuki Masayuki....this brotha can really sing.  Check them both out and enjoy!
