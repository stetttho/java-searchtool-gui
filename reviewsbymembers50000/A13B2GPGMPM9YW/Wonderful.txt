 Listening to this music reminds me of being a young child again.  Dionne Warwick's classic pop sensibilities are simply superb and draw me back to sweet memories of yesteryear. The greatest element to this music is its simplicity.  Few artists nowadays can achieve this, where this is Ms. Warwick's strong suite. "Alfie" is my favorite tune as it begs answers to the questions of life and searches for meaning in it all.  Almost anyone can identify with this sentiment. "Promises,Promises" and "This Girls in Love with You" are equal standouts. Burt Bacharach and Dionne Warwich are musical soulmates. Thanks to their partnership the world of music is that much richer.
