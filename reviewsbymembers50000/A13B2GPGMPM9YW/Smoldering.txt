 This is the first Joni Mitchell CD that I have ever purchased.  Every time I listen to this smokey and smoldering music it sets me in calm and reflective mood.  Her voice caputures the emotions of deep longing and love  in original and captivating ways.  If you find yourself in the need of  solitude and comfort, this recording is will take you to another place....
