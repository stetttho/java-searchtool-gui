 I really have no idea why this beautiful album did not ignite.  SEAL's voice is as goregous here as ever and his lyrics are also introspective and thought-provoking.  "When A Man Is Wrong" is probably my favorite tune in this collection.  I look forward to SEAL's next body of work.  If liked his previous recordings, this one will not disappoint.
