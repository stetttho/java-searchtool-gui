 "The Cost of Loving" is classic Style Council and it will draw you back to the early 80's with remarkable ease.  I remember watching Friday Night Videos one evening and seeing this incredible band called Style Council during my early teens.  They were an interracil British pop group and I had neither seen nor heard anything like them up until that point.  Needless to say, I have been a big fan of their's since that fateful day.  The ablum is an excellent example of how the British re-invent American R&B and Jazz and turn it into something their very own.  Highlights on this album include "The Cost of Loving"  "Angel" and "Heavens Above." Music like this is rarely made anymore.  It is truely unique.
