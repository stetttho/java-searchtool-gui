 The Republicans and other Conservatives who tired to destroy and assasinate the person of Anita Hill were unsuccessful. I found this book to be very deep and profound and allowed my to get to know Prof. Hill. Looking back at the the Hill-Thomas affair is now interesting....it had nothing to do with truth. It was pure partisan politics and nothing more. Unfortunately Prof. Hill was caught in that war and unfortunately America has a man of very low character sitting on its highest of courts.
