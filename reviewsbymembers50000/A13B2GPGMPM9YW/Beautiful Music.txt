 Many years ago Tracy Chapman's debut album captured a part of heart where it still resides to this day. Its introspective and vulnerable lyrics are timeless, rare and about all else, enduring.  No matter how many times I listen to "Fast Car" it always leaves me hopeful and full of promise.  It's a song about the limitless possibilities of life and urgent need to grasp opportunities before they escape us.  The tune "If Not Now, But When" is an incredibly poignant song about the desire to be loved and the disappointment that not receiving love brings.  There is no one on this planet that cannot relate to that experience. By all means listen to this recording.  It's ironic mix of melancholy and beautifully textured acoustic rhythms will set your spirit to rest......and Tracy Chapman sings like an Angel.
