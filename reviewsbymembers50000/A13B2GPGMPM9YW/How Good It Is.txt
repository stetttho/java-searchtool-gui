 Mama's Gun is  very good and a fantastic progression from Baduizm. The one thing that stands out the most on Mama's Gun is the voice of Ms. Eryka Badu.  Often times singers let lyrics, music and noise either drown out their voice or hide it because they really can't singer.  Eryka Badu is the opposite and allows her voice to be witnessed in many different ways.   The tunes "Orange Moon" and "Green Eyes" evoke the classic Blues vibe and transport you to another time.  "Cleva" and "Bag Lady" are neo-soul at its best.  I am so very pleased with the album.  Eryka Badu is gifted and talented.  I look forward to her future work as I am curious to watch to evolution of this fascinating artist.
