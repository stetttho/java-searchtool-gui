 I have never been able to understand why gay asian men are so completely obsessed with capturing a white man. In this film, the lead asian male is in the exclusive company of white males and absolutely never makes mention of his own ethnicity and how it relates to being with only white men. This unrealtic and fantastic approach made this film very unsettling. Racism is a very real force in the gay world and gay asian men in particular seem to support the notion that happiness and sexual pleasure is only found amongst white men. If this film really wanted to be thought-provoking the asian lead male would have been in love with an african-american or EVEN a member of his own race. But I suppose that until gay asian men begin to fully appreciate who they are, films like this will continue to be a tired reality.
