 I have been listening to Madonna since 1982 when I was 13 years old.  In many ways I have grown up with Madonna and her music....which is a good thing.  Having said that, "Ray of Light" is clearly her finest work to date.  I bought this CD when it originaly came out 5 years ago, but it took me that long to learn to appreciate it. Above all else, the lyrics are superb here. They are deep, thoughtful and ironic.  I particularly like "Drowned World"  "Swim" "Little Star" "Candy Perfume Girl"......and last but not least "Frozen", a song whose lyrics are sublime. I was lucky enough to see Madonna's Drowned World Tour this summer in Atlanta.  It was like seeing an old friend and talking over old times.
