 Pearl Jam's "Ten" is a masterful work of art.  I bought this CD upon listening/watching to the tune Alive on MTV and I was completely blown away.  It was one of those rare occasions when a recording totally engulfs and enables you to identify with every lyric wrote and note played.   Unfortunately, I think that Pearl Jam's debut was the apex of their recording career.....which, is just fine because "Ten" is just that good.
