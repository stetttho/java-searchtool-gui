 I don't know if they spent all this time remastering this movie or if I always saw it on overused videotapes. The pictures are clear and the colors are brillant. The sound is crisp. Nothing like I remember the movie. The extras are almost worth the price of admission alone. There is a lot of new and old material. The best being the sing alongs, the lego scenes, and the Japanese version. There is also the standard commentary and interviews stuff if that interests you.
