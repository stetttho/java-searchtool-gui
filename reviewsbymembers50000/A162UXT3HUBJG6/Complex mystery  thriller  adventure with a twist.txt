 First I want to thank Schtinky from the Amazon Disscussion Board for recomending this book to me.  She said it was good and I doubted her--Schtinky was right!  I hate to use the old cliche, but it fits this book perfectly: A real page turner!  I won't go back over all the plot lines, that has been done enough here, but what I enjoyed most about the book was its complexity compared to the average thriller. And when I say complex I don't mean its difficult, the book is easy too read, but there are a couple of different sub plots, each very interesting, but seeming to be going in different directions. But as the book goes along the author weaves it all together very skillfully and never leaves the reader scratching his head.  The reader also has to be careful not to get to attached to anyone character as they might be next to bite the dust, and this greatly added to the suspense.  There is some graphic violence in the story, but I did not feel it was gratuitous and it definitely does not glorify violence but shows it for what it is. There are also some strong sexual content but again I felt it was appropriate to the story.  Another strong point of the story was the Yucatan setting and how Brumfield weaves in the mystery of the ancient Mayans into the plot.  I have never been to the Yucatan, but his descriptions of the ruin sites are very vivid. After reading this book I have put the Yucatan on my list of places to visit before I die!  On top of all this there are a couple of great plot twists that caught me totally by surprise.  If you like Crichton, Rollins, Preston/Childs, Harlan Coben you would probably enjoy this book (though to my mind this author best all these but maybe Crichton).
