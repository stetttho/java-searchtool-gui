 I picked up a copy of this book on a whim, and all I can say is WOW!  The story centers around the conflict between a a powerful and enfluential Long Island family and a Basque firsherman after a mysterious drowning.  The story begins when the Firsherman hauls in a womans body in his fishing net - the body of a woman connected to the powerful local family (I won't give away any more but you can imagine the possibilities).  The writing is smart and the author does a great job of recreating the period prior two World War Two.  This is a great first effort in the Mystery genre.
