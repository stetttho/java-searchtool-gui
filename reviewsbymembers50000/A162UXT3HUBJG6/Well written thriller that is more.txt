 If you like sensational, bloodthirsty serial-killer stories like those of Thomas Harris, this book will not be to your taste. Ms. Rendell's novels are about characters, and she is good at probing the darker side of human behaviour. The crime makes a backdrop to the real story, the shifting tensions and suspicions between the employees and lodgers at a Marleybone antiques shop, who begin to believe they have a killer in their midst. If you like intelligent character develpoment that makes for good reading, this is a book you might enjoy. If you only want empty thrills look somewhere else.
