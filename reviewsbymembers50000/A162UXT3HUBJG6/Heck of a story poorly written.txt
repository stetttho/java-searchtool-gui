 This was my first Cussler novel (I figured I'd start at the begining) and it's a decent enough yarn but atrociously written. The protagonist Dirk Pitt is a James Bondish action caricature, and the dialogue is cliched and corny. People behave and speak in laughably unnatural ways: within an hour of meeting the female lead on an Aegean beach, Pitt slaps her smartly in the face for dwelling excessively on her dead husband. She comes to her senses, and within minutes they're making love on the beach. I'm serious - it's that dumb.  I might be inclined to give Cussler another try, I've heard good things about RAISE THE TITANTIC but it had better be good.
