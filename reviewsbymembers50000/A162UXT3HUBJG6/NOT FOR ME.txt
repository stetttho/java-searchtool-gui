 I heard some good things about this series on the radio and read the reviews online. All seemed to be in order until I read the first few pages. I found It fairly simplistic, Cardboard characters, a weak story line, and an unbelievablely cavalier attitude to violence (even for people from New Jersey - I never realized they all had a "Bruce Willis" nerve in the face of life threatening danger for themselves and their families).  I worry about the state of popular reading when the reviews for this series are so positive.
