 Dan Brown can't solve the biggest problem of a techno-thriller writer: how to incorporate knowledge that the average reader won't know into the story in a natural-sounding way. For instance, the stuff about nuclear physics or medieval religious societies. Sure, we need to be told some of this stuff as background, but when the characters explain it to each other, it sounds dumb. Would a Harvard professor--even a religion professor--know as little about science as Langdon does? Would a scientist really be as ignorant about religion as Vittoria, especially when she's been raised by a priest? Would an Italian woman need to be told who the Swiss Guards are?  Basically, this book reads like a screenplay. I think it should make a pretty good action-packed movie, but as a book, it's quite tedious and artificial-sounding. I'm also kind of offended by the stereotypical character portrayals; it's as if Brown wrote them with an eye to actors who would play them. The wheelchair-bound Dr. Strangelove-like director of CERN. The handsome afraid-of-commitment bachelor professor. Why does Vittoria the scientist have to be beautiful and sexy? Because that way someone like, I don't know, Liv Tyler or Penelope Cruz can play her in the movie.
