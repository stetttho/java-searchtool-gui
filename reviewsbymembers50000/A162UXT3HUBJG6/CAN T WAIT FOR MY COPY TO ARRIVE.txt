 I saw this movie in the theater and loved it.  Nick Cage is great and there is a ton of good old fashoned adveture wrapped up in a good historical mystery!  I have already ordered my DVD.  If you liked "Raiders of the lost Ark", "The Da Vinci Code", or any of Clive Cusslers Dirk Pitt books then this is the movie for you!  And dont listen to the reviewers who try and put this movie down because it is not factual or meet their high artistic standards.  This movie is Kick "A" fun!  Oh yeah, if you like this kind of thriller/adventure you have to check out "Map of Bones" more kick "A' fun!
