 In this edition of the Reacher series we are taken back to New Year's Eve 1990, the Soviet Union is ready to fall and a global power shift has the US military in a quandry. With this as a background a body of a general is found in a motel near Fort Bird, N.C. this is where MP detective Reacher is brought in. The plot thickens as Reacher finds out that the general was on his way to a top secret meeting with a bunch of army intellegence types. Then the general's wife is discovered beaten to death and after that the body of a gay delta force officer. and this is only the start! Jack takes on the case with a his typical mixture of intellegence and violence.  The plot is explosive and kept me guessing until the end. another great read from Mr. Childs!
