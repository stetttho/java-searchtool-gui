 I cannot remember reading a worse book. The only thought I had when finishing it was a regret for the time I wasted. Hard core anti nuke people may relish in the subject and the political position presented, there is nothing here for someone that just likes to read good stories. The stories are absolutely bad and the writing is very amateurish. I had friends in junior high and high school that wrote better stories than these.  All in all, unbelievably bad!
