 Points Unknown is a great anthology of great non-fiction adventure stories. Each story in the anthology is  1.	Written in the first person; those who lived the adventures wrote their own stories, 2.	Written in the 20th century, and  3.	Originally written in English.  A collection of forty-one excerpts of great adventure writing, it includes Scott's Last Expedition by Robert Falcon Scott; The Fight for Everest  by Noel Odell; The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe; Alive: The Story of Andres Survivors by Piers Paul Read; Running the Amazon by Joe Kane; and The Devil's Thumb by Jon Krakauer. Because "originally written in English" is a criteria for stories included in the anthology, it means that great stories and great adventures from great writers are absent and it serves almost as a documentation of English and American adventurers in the twentieth century. I would have preferred a broader focus. While many of the stories focus on Alpine Exploration, it is certainly not the only genre. The book includes stories from exploration of the poles, the deserts, the oceans, and the underworld or caves. The book provides a great way to explore new types of adventure writing. Some types of adventures were of no interest to me and I liked being able to sample a number of stories without investing too much time and energy into them. At the same time, I was able to discover other types of adventures that were very exciting too me though I would not have expected them to be. The book's virtue is also the quality I liked least about the book. On many stories the excerpt ended leaving me hungry for more. As it is a collection of excerpts, it means that the entire story is not included. I have since purchased the full versions of a number of the stories so that I could read the entire story and find out "what happened." All in all a great book and highly recommended to anyone who has interest in exploring different types of non-fiction adventure stories.
