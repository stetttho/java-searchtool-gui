 After having disappeared since Amused to Death in 1992, Roger Waters reemerges with his criticism of current world politics. While Waters has a long history of masterfully editorializing society with poetic lyrics and inventive music, these songs fall short. As a long-time fan I tried very hard to like these songs but the more I listen to them the more annoying they are. The lyrics are weak, completely devoid of his usual symbolism and power. The music is just plain boring and uncreative.   The fact that there are only two very political songs rather than a full album leads me to believe that these were either released to either cash in on the current anti-war sentiments or to make his political points. At $20 for two songs, it seems money is a motivator and obviously hypocritical to his own songs. In the case of making anti-war statements, he should skip it. Everyone with a movie camera or a guitar has already made the points.   Very disappointing! I simply cannot believe that after seventeen years, this is the best he could come up with. He should have stayed retired.
