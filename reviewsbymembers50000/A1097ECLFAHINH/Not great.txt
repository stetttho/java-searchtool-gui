Even the formatting of the plans are bad; they look like they were written on a typewriter twenty years ago! The book offers little to no advice on how to write your plan for different target audiences, what elements are important for different types of businesses, and because its examples are so incomplete, they give someone without prior exposure to business plans a false idea of what your financier is really looking for. ...
