 If you are looking for an easier to read manual of the Canon EOS 2000, this is the book for you. If you are a novice wanting to learn about photography, forget about it. I bought the Canon EOS 2000 because I wanted to learn to take professional pictures yet have the automatic features so I can take "good" pictures while I am learning. I expected this book to help me make the jump from using the automatic features to using the camera in the manual mode. In other words, I expected to learn something about photography. Unfortunately, this book did not help. The book does a reasonable job of explaining the different automatic modes and situations where they should be used. It also provides information about how to change the settings of the camera and some basic information about how you can take better pictures. At the same time though, it does not teach anything about photography. I guess they assume that someone wanting to know about the manual settings is already versed in photography and knows what to do with them. In my case, they were wrong. A huge portion of the book is dedicated to lenses. It uses more than 50 pages of the 175 pages for providing the history of removable lenses, zoom lenses, and listing the different lenses available for the camera. While this maybe a helpful reference sometime in the future, it does virtually nothing for teaching me about photography. Disappointing. The bottom line is that if you are looking for getting more information about the camera, you will find it here. If you want to learn something about photography, look somewhere else.
