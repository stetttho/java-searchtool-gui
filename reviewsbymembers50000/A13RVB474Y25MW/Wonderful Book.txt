 Benny Hinn is a mighty servant of the Lord, and so humble. I thank the  Lord for using Pastor Benny in such a tremendous way to bring the message  of God's love and healing power to so many hurting people around the world;  and also to teach Christians how to become closer to our Heavenly Father.  What a blessing he is to my life. I am very familiar with Pastor Benny's  ministry, and have read many of his books. Believe me when I say, he is for  real. Each book is packed with truth and revelations for the reader. Each  book gently and lovingly teaches us how to experience more of our precious  Lord's presence and power. I believe the God's Children are hungrier for  more of Him than ever been before...I know I am. If you long for a closer,  more intimate walk with the Master, please read this book. Also, it will  teach people who are interested in going into the ministry how to be  certain of your calling, and how to recieve the annointing. Pastor Benny  showes us that we have to pay the price for the annointing, and what the  price is. I highly recomend this book and all others by this author.  They'll change your life. God Bless.
