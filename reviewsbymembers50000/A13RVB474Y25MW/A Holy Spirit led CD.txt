 This CD is wonderful! The worship songs on this CD are some of my  favorites, and so annointed. Pastor Benny has put together a CD of  uplifting and joyful praise songs, combined with loving and precious  worship songs to our Master. "Holy Spirit, Thou Art Welcome" is  one of my favorites. Also, the the scriptures read on this CD are a  blessing, as well as the bit of talking and praying. No one leads worship  better than Benny Hinn. Don Moen and Alvin Slaughter both sing on this CD,  as well. If you long for an annointed worship CD, this is it!
