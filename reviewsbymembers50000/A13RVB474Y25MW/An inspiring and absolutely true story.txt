 I just finished reading this book cover to cover in a day. It was definitely too good to put down. Benny Hinn did a wonderful job telling his life story, including the trials and the happy times. I think the book was  an inspiration to all, that not only does God really perform miracles, He  loves His children deeply, and is always faithful. I so enjoyed reading  about Pastor Benny's visions and encounters with the Lord. I noticed that  throughout the book, Pastor Benny would take the time to give God all the  glory for His miracles. What a humble man of God Benny Hinn is. Perhaps  that is one of the reasons God can use him so much. I think this book reads  very well, and if you haven't read it, what are you waiting for?
