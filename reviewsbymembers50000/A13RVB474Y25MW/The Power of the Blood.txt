 First of all, I have to say, what a tremendous book! If you have trouble believing that the blood of Jesus can do more then wash your sins away, you have to read this book! Pastor Benny does a great job of answering questions and explaining, with a Biblical foundation, just how much power there is in the Blood of the Lamb. I have read most of Benny's books now, and have been taught, inspired, and loved all of them. Not only is Benny a wonderful and anointed man of God, he's a wonderful man. His love for the Lord is clearly evident in all that he does, as is his love for his wife, and children. He's very real, and open, and that really comes out in his writing. His books are not only informative, and will bless your life, you'll really enjoy reading them! I have to be careful when I read his books....because when I pick one up, I can't put it down, and end op reading all night! I highly recommend this book, and all of his books.
