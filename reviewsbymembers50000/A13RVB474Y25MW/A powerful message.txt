 I recently purchased pastor Sam's book and was captivated by it. I literally  could not put down. I gave my heart to Jesus when I was just 3 years old, and have grown to love Him more with each passing day. Though I  have always known the importance of worship, Changed in His Presence  instilled a great hunger in me for more of God. I think this book is a  "must read" for all Christians, as it teaches us there is always  so much more to reach for in Him, and to never become complacent. Pastor  Sam is such a gentle teacher and his love for others and above all, our  Lord, shines through in his writing. If you haven't read this book, order  it today. I guarantee you will read it cover to cover from the moment you  pick it up.
