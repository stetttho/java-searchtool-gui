 I have read many of Pastor Benny's books and "Welcome Holy Spirit" was as wonderful as the rest of his books. He teaches in such a gentle way. This book is a sequel to "Good Morning Holy  Spirit". Both books are packed with life changing truths. If you  desire a closer, more intimate walk with our precious Lord Jesus, I would  highly recommend reading this book. If you are skeptical about the  authenticity of the miracles Benny talks about in this book, please, read  it for yourself and make your own decisions. I truly believe if you read it  with a heart open to the voice of the Holy Spirit, you will see that it is  genuine. I am very familiar with Pastor Benny's ministry, and have seen  awesome miracles take place in his services first hand. It is a wonderful  book..one I think everyone will benefit from reading.
