 What a blessing this book is! Benny Hinn is such a mighty man of God, and a powerful teacher. Though I was born again as a small child, I long to know the Holy Spirit more intimately. Pastor Benny teaches Christians how  to do just that and in such a gentle way. There is nothing self-praising or  arrogant about this man...he has been blessed with such an anointing and  gives our wonderful Lord all the credit. If you hunger for more of God's  presence in your life, I urge you to read this book immediately. It really  will change your life. Let the message sink deep into your heart and yield  all to our Master. I thank God for all Pastor Benny has been in my life and  continues to be.
