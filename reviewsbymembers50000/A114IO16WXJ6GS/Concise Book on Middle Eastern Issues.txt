 I liked this short, compact book very much.  It is composed of several essays written by noted scholars, diplomats, heads of state, and journalists, in which different viewpoints are represented with respect to Middle Eastern issues.  Many diverse subjects are addressed such as: America's role in the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process, Iraq, Iran, and many, many more topics.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Middle East, because it is thorough, yet easy to understand.
