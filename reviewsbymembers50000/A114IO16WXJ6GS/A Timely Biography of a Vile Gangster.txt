 Con Coughlin's biography of Saddam Hussein is very well written.  Coughlin eloquently reveals Saddam Hussein's true colors - colors that should dispel the liberal illusion that regime change in Iraq was wrong.  In addition, Coughlin writes for London's Sunday Telegraph.  His reporting is top-notch, his insights invaluable.  A recent report of his was that of a hand written memo discovered by the Iraqi Governing Council addressed to Saddam Hussein, written by Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, saying that Mohammed Atta (chief 9/11 hijacker) has completed his training w/Abu Nidal in Baghdad and is now ready to "destroy the targets we seek to destroy".  The truth hurts - especially for liberal propagandists.  This book is a succint and eloquent biography of one of history's most egregious tyrants.
