 As a staunch Bush supporter, and with the US election fast-approaching, I felt compelled to read one anti-Bush prior to Nov. 2.  As I predicted, Craig Unger's House of Bush House of Saud, proved to be an interesting read.  It did not alter my favorable view of Bush, but it did illuminate some interesting facts.  I disagree with the author concerning the Iraq war, which I believe was justified.  Moreover, there is a lot of information in this book which I find to be baseless.  What I do agree with Unger on, as a staunch Bush supporter and someone who believes in seeing the terror war to a successful conclusion, is that the Saudis are hardly friends of the United States.  Indeed, they seem to be a problematic ally at best, rival at worst.  As Unger demonstrates, althoughout there is no conclusive evidence that the House of Saud as a whole knowingly funds/abets al Qaeda, there are elements within the monarchy who are sympathetic to militant Islamist causes.  However, it goes without saying that the current Saudi monarchial regime is better than the alternative - a radical Islamist theocracy.  George W. Bush is hardly perfect.  Aside from being a mediocre communicator, in addition to not being a rocket scientist, he has some faults.  However, when juxtaposed with Mr. Kerry, I believe the choice for Americans is clear.  Bush is a fundamentally good, honest person, and his policies indeed are, in my view, making the USA a safer place.  Bush has put some pressure on the Saudis, and they have made some high profile raids and arrests.  However, there is always room for improvement, and the more pressure put on them the better.  One underlying fact is that there is little doubt that Mr. Kerry will be even more lenient with the Saudis.
