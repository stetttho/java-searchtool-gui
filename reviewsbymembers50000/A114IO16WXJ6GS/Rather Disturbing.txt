 Richard Miniter has written a very devastating book for the Clinton Administration.  In it, he elucidates the plethora of failiures the Administration made with respect to fighting bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network.   This is not to say that the Clinton Administration did nothing.  It actually acheived some very commendable successes in the secret war against Al Qaeda, the arrest of Ramzi Youssef (mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing) being a prime example.   But in reading this book it becomes overwhelmingly evident that the Clinton Administration's policies against the terrorist network were not sufficiently vigorous.   Do not read this book to convict Clinton - he was a good man who made some mistakes.  Read it to understand the failiures he and his Administration made regarding the strugle against bin Laden, and learn from his mistakes.   Regrettably, it is now demonstrably evident that the Bush Administration's approach in dealing with terrorist acts - treating them as acts of war, rather than conventional crimes, is the correct policy.  We cannot negotiate with terrorists, nor can we deal with them solely with law enforcement and inditements.  We must simply destroy Al Qaeda in its entirety.
