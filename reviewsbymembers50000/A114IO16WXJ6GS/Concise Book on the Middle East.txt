 This was a very clear and succint book in which several essays regarding the Middle East are presented.  Each essay is written by a different author who espouses a different viewpoint.  Scores of Middle Eastern issues are addressed such as: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict/peace process, Iraq, Iran, the US role in the Middle East, Islamic fundamentalism, etc.  I highly recommend this book because many different perceptions are presented, thereby allowing the reader to come to his/her own conclusions concerning Middle Eastern issues.  The book is unbiased, concise, and compelling.
