 I am giving this book two stars because I am in a good mood!  In actual fact, it is a rather mediocre work, as the plot is incredibly boring and redundant.  In almost 300 pages, practically nothing happens in this book!  The characters behave somewhat immaturely in this book as well.  Personally, I believe this book should be avoided.
