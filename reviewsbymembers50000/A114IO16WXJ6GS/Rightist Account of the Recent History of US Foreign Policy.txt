 Though this book can be somewhat rambling and slow at times, it can be funny and witty all the same.   Almost the entire book is devoted to how Coulter perceives Democratic administrations failed to effectively fight Communism and the Cold War, culminating in Ronald Reagan's victory of the Soviet Union.  In addition, she gives a spirited defense of Republican Senator Joseph McCarty, who exposed Communist traitors such as Alger Hiss, for who they are.   She also discusses the current Bush administration and its opponents in regards to the War on Terror, making the case that the administration, and the Republican Party, are pursuing a more proactive strategy to win the War on Terror.   She constantly characterizes the left as being composed of elitist liberal extremists from Hollywood, the media, and the Democratic Party.  Moreover, she makes the case that the views these liberals espouse are contrary to those of the American people.   Though Coulter's Treason is incredibly one-sided in its account of the recent history of US foreign policy, it is a good read.  Coulter seems to have nothing positive whatsoever to say about Democrats, and her views are a little over the top in my view.  As a Bush supporter, though, I liked her book and agreed with the vast majority of the ideas presented in it.
