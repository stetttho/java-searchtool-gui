 This book is an excellent primer on the correct method to prosecute the war on terror.  Frum and Perle cogently and eloquently make the case that hard-line foreign policy renders America significantly safer than conventional soft-line foreign policy, that many in the Democratic party advocate, and Bush's predecessor practiced.  Everyone, Americans and foreigners alike (I actually am Canadian), ought to read this book.  It is an indispensable work that sets the record straight and dispels many myths perpetrated by the left.  George W. Bush will lead the US to victory in the war on terror, and the free world will prevail!
