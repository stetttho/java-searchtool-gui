 While, in my view, Celsius 41.11 isn't as good a rebuttal to Fahrenheit 9/11 as is FahrenHYPE 9/11, it is still worth watching.  Many distinguished opinion makers make the case for Bush's policies in the War on Terror.  In addition, Kerry is criticized (although in not as vitriolic a way one might think).  He is portrayed as an honorable man with good motives, but someone who can't get the job done.  Unfortunately, Celsius 41.11 features little special effects and therefore can be boring at times.  However, it is an informative documentary worth watching.
