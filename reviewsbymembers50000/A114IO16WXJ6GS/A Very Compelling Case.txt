 Professor Dershowitz manages to refute over 20 myths in a relatively short, easy-to-read book.  It is not an extremist pro-Israeli book, but merely a book advocating Israel's right to exist and defend its citizens from terrorism.  Dershowitz advocates the two-state solution as the solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, as do most moderates worldwide.  He also underscores the palpable double standard the international community applies to the State of Israel and to the Jewish people.  The double standard truly is unfortunate.  In short, I highly recommend this book to people seeking cold, hard facts about the Middle East, as well as people who want to fully assess whether or not the plethora of accusations against Israel are, in fact, accurate.
