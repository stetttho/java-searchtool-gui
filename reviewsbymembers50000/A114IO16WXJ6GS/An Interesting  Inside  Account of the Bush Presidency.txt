 Despite the fact that this book is slow at times, it, for the most part, is a riveting and candid account of what went on in the Bush white house, from its inauguration, to 9/11, to the present context of the November 2004 presidential election. David Frum, a native of Toronto, Canada, was a former economic speechwriter for George W. Bush.  He actually is the author of the famous "axis of evil" statement in the 2002 State of the Union Address.  Well, in actual fact, he introducted the notion of an "axis of hatred", but, due to Bush's theological vernacular, Michael Gerson, the chief speechwriter, modified it to "axis of evil".  David Frum's other main book, An End to Evil, co-authored by Richard Perle, in my view, is a far more relevant and riveting manifesto on the hard-line school of thought with respect to foreign policy.   Although he is of a favorable view of the president, the first several chapters convey the message that George W. Bush was destined to be a mediocre president. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, defined the Bush presidency.  George W. Bush would prove to be a decisive leader - the Ronald Reagan of his time.  He would respond with the declaration of war against the United States on 9/11 with the introduction and prosecution of a "war on terror" - an historic engagement between good and evil, whereby the United States leads an international coalition against terrorists and rogue states.
