 Fahrenhype 911 is a very succinct documentary in which many distinguished opinion makers refute all of the lies and deceptions perpetrated in Fahrenheit 911.  The viewer will be surprised to see the number of moderate Democrats in this film that are supporting Bush's candidacy for reelection, as well as who loathe Michael Moore.  Indeed, Dick Morris, the man behind this documentary, is a former Clinton advisor.  There are, however, many conservative commentators as well.  Fahrenhype 911 is a very riveting documentary that totally deconstructs Moore's propaganda, demonstrates the real reasons for the invasion of Iraq, and highlights the Bush Administration's many successes in the war on terror - both domestic and international.  Due to the lack of significant special affects, or musical score, however, I am giving Fahrenhype 911 four stars.  It goes without saying, however, that despite the lack of great graphics or sound, the documentary is extremely interesting.  After all, documentaries aren't supposed to be replete with sensational images, and in-your-face sounds, as Michael Moore's vile, and slanderous movie Fahrenheit 911, is.
