 This book was superb.  It was informative, and elucidated scores of facts with respect to George W. Bush.  The information was irrefutable, and the book is absolutely devastating to Bush-haters.  I was delighted to finally see someone step up to the plate and dispell the "Crazy Liberal Ideas", one-by-one.  Podhoretz also manages to maintain a light-hearted, funny tone, throughout the book.  A truly relevant book now, with the election under way - Kerry VS Bush.  This book is book is essential for understanding George W. Bush - a disciplined, strong, compassionate man, who continues to lead America in the right direction.
