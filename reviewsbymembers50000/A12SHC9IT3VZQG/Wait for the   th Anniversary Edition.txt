 Okay...there is absolutely no debating the merits of this excellent early-80's comedy..."National Lampoon's Vacation" is without question one of the funniest comedies of the last 25 years, and definitely Chevy Chase's best film.   The problem is Universal's typical shoddy handling of it.  I mean, it's the 20th anniversary of this movie, and they release it with a MONO 2.0 soundtrack?!  What the---?!  IT'S 2003, WHERE THE HECK IS THE 5.1 SURROUND SOUND?!   By now many people have home theaters and expect new DVD's to be remastered with surround sound (or geez, at least STEREO) but again Universal has failed us.  I wanna hear Lindsey Buckingham's "Holiday Road" in surround sound, darnit!  It's the exact opposite problem of Univeral's other long-awaited reissues ("Weird Science", "Sixteen Candles" and "Breakfast Club").  Those movies are mastered in surround but are completely no-frills as far as the extras go.  "Vacation" has the extras (commentary, etc.) but [bad] sound.   Expect a super-special 25th anniversary edition in 2008 that has good sound and doesn't come in the stupid cardboard snap case that everyone hates!
