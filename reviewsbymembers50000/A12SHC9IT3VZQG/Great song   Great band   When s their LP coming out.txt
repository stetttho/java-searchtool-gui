 Yet another single from up-and-coming indie band, Keane,  "Somewhere Only We Know" is another fine song featuring melodic piano playing and the sweet falsetto of vocalist Tom Chaplin.  These guys remind me of Travis (circa "The Man Who") not Coldplay as the other reviewer incorrectly suggested.  But the fact that they use no guitars give them a more unique sound then either of those bands. What I like about this song is that it seems more assured then the previous also-excellent "Everybody's Changing".  That song sounded more like the work of a one-hit wonder, while "Somewhere Only We Know" sounds like a band that has already been producing great records for a long time. The only negative is that they keep releasing singles...now that they've signed with a major label, let's see a full length album!
