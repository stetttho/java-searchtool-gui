 I got into the Pernice Bros. about a month ago when I heard a few songs on Amazon, then bought the cd.  It's greatness caused me to drive two hours to see them at the Casbah in San Diego.  Now I can't understand how I've gotten by without them! Simply put, this album is annoyingly good...annoying in the sense it makes all of the other 350 cd's I own sound obselete, and annoying because there are moments (i.e. when I'm working and when I'm sleeping) that I cannot listen to it!  YM&O is one of those rare albums that is undeniably great, but it's difficult to pin down exactly why.  Sure it has first-rate songwriting, lyrics, musicianship and vocals, but often these factors do not equal an awesome album; however, in this case YM&O is even greater than the sum of these substantial parts.  And it keep getting better.  The first time I heard it I immediately gravitated to tracks 4, 6, 8 and 10.  But after repeated listenings, I now can't get enough of tracks 2, 5, 7 and 9!   For me it all starts with Pernice's voice. It has a smoothness completely devoid of grit but not emotion, and at times echoes Morrissey (particularly track 7) and New Order, but is wholly its own.   One of the earlier reviewers complained that this album is too short, but to me this is an empty criticism.  In an age of overblown albums with 10 good minutes and 50 minutes of filler, Pernice has trimmed the fat to produce 30 minutes of perfection.  This album should make all other rock bands either take a look in the mirror or hire Pernice to write their songs.  Everybody else makes noise about the White Stripes and Outkast, but to me the YM&O is the REAL best album of 2003.
