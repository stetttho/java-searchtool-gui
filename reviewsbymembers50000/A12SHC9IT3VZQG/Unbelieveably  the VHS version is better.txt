 Boy, did Universal Home Video drop the ball on this one..."Sixteen Candles" may not be the most disappointing DVD release ever (that would be, hands down, National Lampoon's Vacation) but it's close!  The only thing that saves it is the widescreen format.  What's up with the mono soundtrack?  It sounds like it's coming from a 1950 am radio!  Even the VHS version was mastered in stereo.  And c'mon, there must have been some deleted scenes or extra footage they could've thrown into the mix!   Of course, this excellent '80s teen comedy stands up very well on its own, but it's still insulting that it gets such shoddy treatment.  Even Universal's similarly no-frills "Weird Science" DVD was at least mastered in surround sound. Unless you're a complete nut for the film, I recommend you wait for the inevitable special edition to come out.  In the meantime, turn on your TV...it's on cable constantly!
