 ...because so many performances are phoned in.  Which is surprising because Greg Kinnear and Billy Bob Thorton are Oscar-nominated actors.  Yet somehow, they never transcend being Greg Kinnear and Billy Bob Thorton acting in a lame remake of Bad News Bears.  And unfortunately the kid actors do nothing to distiguish themselves either.  At no point in this movie does anything feel even remotely realistic.  The baseball games, the dialogue, the interactions between the kids, the relationships between the characters, the "brawl" scenes...it all feels staged and scripted.  It's almost like the filmmakers felt like it was enough just to have the character spout vulgarities and constantly bicker.  That miscalculation leaves a very empty movie in its wake.  I went in hoping director Richard Linklater could again capture lightning in a bottle, like he did in the excellent School of Rock.  Now I understand that the success of that movie was more a result of Jack Black's tremendous performance, rather than anything Linklater did.  Though those child actors were light years ahead of what is on display here.  Normally, Bad News Bears would be remarkable for it's mediocrity, it's phoniness and sub-par performances.  However, it has the good fortune (and us, the bad fortune) of being released in close proximity to "Kicking a Screaming," the Will Ferrell kid-soccer vehicle that is equal in its inaneness.  Planet Earth was a better place before either of these films was released.
