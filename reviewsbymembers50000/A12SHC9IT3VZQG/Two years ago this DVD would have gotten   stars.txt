 The fact that this DVD even exists is testament to the extent movie studios will go to make extra profit.  X-Men 1.5 has THE EXACT SAME MOVIE that was released on the original X-Men DVD two years ago (a great film, by the way).  The difference is that -- in a ... attempt to ... additional coin from all of the hard-core fans out there (myself included) -- this version includes additional bells and whistles such as director's commentary, deleted scenes and featurettes not included before (including a sneak peek at the sequel).  So I'm giving this five-star movie one star because it's two years too late! Studios should only be allowed to release a film on DVD once...that way, they'll get it right the first time!  Fox dropped the ball when they came out with the first DVD by including very few extras, and now they're trying to make up for it by releasing a version that includes all of stuff the first disc lacked! This disturbing rerelease trend is happening with increased regularity (SEE ALSO: The Mummy Ultimate Edition, Lord of the Rings) as the DVD phenomenon continues to explode.  Now, I can understand a rerelease for a movie that originally came out a long time ago when deleted scenes and similar extras were relatively rare...but, c'mon, X-Men is a recent movie!   So the fans are ... yet again...while Fox laughs all the way to the bank!
