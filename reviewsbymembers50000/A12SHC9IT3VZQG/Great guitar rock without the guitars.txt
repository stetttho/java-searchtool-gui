 Keane is being hailed as the latest of the Radiohead-influenced bands (Travis, Coldplay, Muse, South, Elbow, Leaves, etc.) to come to America.  However, while the aforementioned bands are more traditional guitar-based rock outfits, Keane employs no guitars on their debut album, "Hopes and Fears".  Instead they combine percussion, piano and electronic effects to achieve their unique sound...and do it so well that nobody misses the guitars! But there is no question that Keane's silver bullet is the unbelievably sweet falsetto of lead singer Tom Chaplin, which is two parts Jeff Buckley, one part Francis Healy of Travis, one part Thom York of Radiohead and ten parts heaven.  Put that all together and you have a truly stunning voice that is without peer.  Check out the audio samples and you'll see what I mean! What I love about "Hopes and Fears" is that it does not sound like typical debut albums, which frequently are uneven as bands try to nail down their sound.  This is a well-produced album from an assured band that is not afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve.  In fact, one of the most impressive things about "Hopes and Fears" is the range the band displays here, from heart-tugging ballads ("She Has No Time) to more upbeat toe-tappers (This is the Last Time).  Some numbers are lush and highly-produced ("Everybody's Changing") while others are quietly acoustic ("We Might As Well Be Strangers").   This is a band that is talented and versatile enough that they don't need to repeat themselves, and the result is a record that I can listen to over and over again, which is saying a lot.  Definitely keep an eye on Keane.
