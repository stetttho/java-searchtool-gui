 "Emperor's New Groove" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in some time, which is especially surprising considering it seemed impossible for it to be good given the clumsy concept and horrible title. Disney scrapped the singing animals for once and just went for outright laughs, and they scored big in this tale of an emperor with an attitude that gets taken down a peg when he gets changed into a llama. Casting Patrick Warburton (Puddy from Seinfeld) as the Cronk, the lackey to Ertha Kitt's Yzma was sheer genius...if it was possible to receive an academy award for voice work in an animated feature, he'd have it locked up. Though truly all of the voices are perfect in this movie, and it really does add so much to it. I know that it hasn't been as successful at the box office as some of the other recent Disney films, and that's a shame, because it deserves more recognition. I wish more movies like this were made.
