 This movie had every chance to succeed: A great trailer; Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman; a John and Jim Thomas (Predator, Executive Decision) script; a budget of $40 mil.  But for all this, the whole is decidedly less than the sum of it's parts. What happened? Well for one thing, Owen Wilson was all but wasted in his role as Lt. Barnett.  No chances to utilize the deft comic touch he's displayed in Shanghai Noon and Zoolander.  All he had to do in this film was run from guys shooting at him, and while he does that effectively, what's the point?  I wish that he had been given the freedom to do more with the role.  Meanwhile Gene Hackman essentially reprises the same role that he had in Crimson Tide, then as a sub captain, now a ship admiral.  Though it is a role his fills well, it's not as interesting anymore.  Also, "Enemy Lines" strains plausibility more than even the most unbelievable flag-waving war film...the scene where he hides in a graveyard of corpses with the enemy literally walking over him was especially ludicrous.   And I found myself annoyed by much of director John Moore's camera work.  Obviously he's yet another commercial director, based on the frenetic herky-jerky camera work on display here.  Can't these guys just hold the camera still and let the action unfold, as opposed to trying to create the action with a bunch of quick cuts and shaky shots? I really wanted this movie to be good, and just because it's better than most of the mediocrity released last year, that's still no excuse.  It could've been much more. Perhaps the true test of a movie's worth: I will not be buying this one when it is available on DVD.
