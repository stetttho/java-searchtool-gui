 This album does have some nice chillout grooves, but overall i was disappointed in it.  I'm not saying that you won't like it, because you probably will, but there are a number of other compilations out there that are much better.   If you're new to chillout and are interested in the genre, definitely go with Ministry of Sound's Chillout Sessions 1 & 2 and Ibiza Chillout Session.  These are imports CD's and cost $5 to $10 more, but they also have 30+ tracks and are a much better overview of the genre.  Trust me, i listen to these cd's constantly and people are always asking me what it is I'm listening to. For those that already own some chillout CD's and are looking to go even further, Hed Kandi's Winter Chill Collection (especially vol. 2) is excellent and contains amazing tracks that you won't find on most compilations.  Also, the well-known Cafe Del Mar series boasts a number of CD's containing more great tracks that you won't find anywhere else. My problem with Ultra is that it seems like a "generic" American overview of what is really a genre developed and made popular in Europe.  Would you buy a European compilation of rap music?  Of course not.  And to really get the cream of the chillout crop, pay the extra five bones for the superior European import compilations.  You won't be disappointed
