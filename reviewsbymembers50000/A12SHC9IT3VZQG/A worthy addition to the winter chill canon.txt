 Of the plethora of chillout compilations available today, Hed Kandi's Winter Chill collection stands out.  Characterized by chillingly fantastic grooves, powerful beats and sultry female vocals, Winter Chill 3 is at least as good as its predecessors.   Sets a great mood for hanging out at home, driving, coming down for a long night of partying, or the bedroom.  Standouts on this collection are the phenomenal "Evergreen" from Faithless, Lamb's beautiful "Gabriel", and Natural Calamity's silky-smooth "And That's Saying A Lot". What I like best about these collections is the fact that the CD's offer a wide array of music that you normally won't find anywhere else.  Most of these artists you've probably never heard before, and that's unbelieveable considering the quality of the tracks.  Highly recommended, especially for those that are fans of the Cafe Del Mar series.
