 Why settle for two-disc trance collections with 30 songs when you can get this baby (4 cd's, 100 tracks) for the same price?  I found this collection when I was in Holland (ie. trance capital of the world!) and it lives up to the ultimate tag!  If you have any interest in trance music whatsoever, this collection is a must.  Even if it's the only trance compilation you ever buy, it will be enough, there's so much here! Some of the many highlights are "Back in My Life" (Alice Deejay), "Turn Up the Bass" and "Sunstorm."  All of the songs are mixed together and are perfect for a party/rave of your own.
