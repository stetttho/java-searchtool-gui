 This is the type of album that you listen to and everyone asks "What is that?" because they like it so much.  This is the compilation that really turned me onto chillout music.  If you're not familiar, chillout encompasses a number of music styles including deep house, chilled trance, acid jazz, etc.  Basically, it's solid down-tempo stuff that you can listen to while at work, relaxing at home, driving, coming down from a night of partying, making out, etc.  If you're into Moby's recent mellow stuff and are looking for more by other artists, you're guaranteed to like this. The first disk is the stronger of the two here, and with the exception of Moby's excellent but oft-played "Porcelain" and perhaps Delerium's "Silence", contains tracks that most people have not heard.  Highlights include Dusted's "Always Remember to Respect and Honor Your Mother" Bent Remix (and if you've never heard it, check out the even better original mix on Dusted's album), Goldfrapp's "Utopia" and the amazing deep grooves of Aware's "Revoked." A lot of this music you can't find elsewhere, which is unfortunate, because it's great stuff.  Highly recommended.
