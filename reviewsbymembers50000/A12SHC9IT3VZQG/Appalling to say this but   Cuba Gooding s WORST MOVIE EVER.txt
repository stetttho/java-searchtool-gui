 Cuba Gooding Jr., purveyor of truly awful films such as "Boat Trip", "Snow Dogs" and "Chill Factor", has reached new depths with his latest offering, "The Fighting Temptations".  He has now officially squandered any last remnants of goodwill he had left from his Oscar win for "Jerry Maguire" (his good movie) in 1997. I caught this film on an airplane flight from NY to LA, and let me tell you...even then I felt like I had wasted my time!  Because I could have stared straight ahead at the seat in front of me and been more entertained!  Other reviewers are defending this movie by talking about how great the music is.  Fine, buy the soundtrack but whatever you do...DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!  Good music does not a good movie make!  Go see Blues Brothers, which is a superior movie,  plus has Gospel music sung by James Brown!  Who, in case you were wondering, is cooler than Beyonce Knowles! The acting in Temptations is beyond awful all around (Beyonce, we hardly knew ye) the insipid plot is embarassingly predictable (guess who wins the gospel competition at the end of the film) and this movie has the distinction of having perhaps the fakest corporate meeting in the history of phony movie corporate meetings.   Are we supposed to care about any of these characters?  Gooding's character is a habitual liar that fakes his resume, leads a gospel choir because he wants his aunt's inheritance, and shamelessly hits on Beyonce Knowles.  And we're supposed to care about him because...? But if you aren't looking for things such as plot, good acting or a well-written script, then by all means buy this dvd and put it on your shelf next to "Gigli", "Battlefield Earth", "From Justin to Kelly", and "Glitter", other films you surely own.
