 I don't know what CD all of the other reviewers were listening to when they made their Portishead comparisons, but this album sounds NOTHING LIKE PORTISHEAD, and Moa's voice resembles WILLIAM SHATNER's at much as BETH GIBBONS'!  That's said, it's not a poor album by any means, but let's get our comparisons straight!  If you're looking for Portishead sound-alikes, go with Massive Attack, Hooverphonic or Everything But the Girl. If we must pigeonhole, "Universal" is sort of a lounge-cabaret-jazz fusion with a trip-hop influence.  An apt comparison would be Morcheeba, yet they're still distant relatives.  Actually, the music reminds me a bit more of Esthero, at least the arrangements (not the vocals.) But the music takes a backseat to the vocals here, and therein lies one's response to the album -- you either love or hate her voice.  As I listen to it, I can definitely understand how some could hate her voice (you get the feeling SHE loves the sound of it!) but she's got pipes, no questions there.   I'll award it 3 stars...(...)  Make of that what you will.  It's worth owning, but only after you own the CD's of superior chanteuse's, such as the aforementioned Esthero and Dido.
