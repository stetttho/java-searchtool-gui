 While the DVD was technically well done; transfer was good, sound was good.  The content was without merit.  It seemes to strive for a Short Stories feel but it fell far short. I for one, do not need to see a bunch  of "walk-in" scenes.  They have no real dramatic effect. Do not  waste your time or your money on this dog. D not waste your money on this  dog.
