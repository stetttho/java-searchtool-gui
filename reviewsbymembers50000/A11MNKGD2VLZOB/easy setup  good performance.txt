 Setup was easy.  I did not install the included setup software, but rather accessed the WAP54G console via the http address using IE6.  The console was easy to understand.  All security features are set to "off" out of the box.  You must manaully go in and change setting to provide any level of security.  They provide excellent directions on how to tighten up security (http://www.linksys.com/splash/wirelessnotes.asp).  I am connecting this to my Linksys 4 port dsl/cable router.  Overall, I am extremely pleased with this product.
