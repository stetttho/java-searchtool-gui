 Both the audio and video transfer are good. The Dolby 2 sound is good.  5.1 would have been better. It is very critical that you first read the book.  The character developement in the movie is lacking and therefore some of the scenes do not have the full impact; ie the back armour, Hart's Spain experience, the harmonization of the guns, and Fanny's concerns about leading the squadron. There are significant plot difference between the book and the movie. Upon initial viewing I was very disappointed.  However, after flying some Microsoft Combat Flight simulator, and re-reading the book, subsequent viewings improved. If you have not read the book you will be missing a lot of the sub-plot lines that are barely touched upon in the movie.
