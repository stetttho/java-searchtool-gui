 This is an excellent book that explains the need for patriots.  It traces the concept of patriotism from Sparta throught the Founding to current times.   Of particular interest is its discuss of why Frederick Douglass felt that before a black man could become a citizen, he should first serve as a soldier.  It discusses why the Founders realized the critical need for patriots, while at the same time not holding out much hope for such people.   I strongly recommend this book, especially in light of current events.
