 While a book like Mas Ayoob's In the Gravest Extreme" is written for someone new to the field of self-defense, this book is for the more advanced student. As such, it provides bits and pieces of information.  A  word of wisdom here, a pearl of knowledge there.  More advance students  should not expect anymore.  I recommend this book as part of anyone  library of self-defense books.
