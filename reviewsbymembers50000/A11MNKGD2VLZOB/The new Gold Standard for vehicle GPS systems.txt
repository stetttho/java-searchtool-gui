 I have used several GPS systems in the past; Deloreme Street Atlas 2003 on my laptop with their Earthmate ,and the Garmin GPS III. The Navman ICN 630 is far and away superior to all of the above.  It is more accurate then the Delorme. The screen is like the screen on a laptop computer.  It is bright and easy to read.  It is very easy to operate the unit.  The accuracy is excellent.  Regardless of zoom level I am always on the road.  The 2 inch speaker provides clear verbal directions.  Verbal directions are provided early and often. I would recommend a 256MB SD Card.  Each region is between 30 and 50MB.  You can load two regions in the base memory of 64MB. Software installation is smooth.  All updates and map loads are performed via USB.  Map uploads can take 15 minutes per region (no big deal).  The software is bullet proof, you can do other tasks while performing map uploades. ...
