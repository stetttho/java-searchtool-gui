 The Transfer was very good; only one small glitch between reels. It was clear and crisp and in letterbox. The sound was Center Speaker only (no surprise due to the age of the movie.  The content was  excellent. Overall it was very well done.  As mentioned elsewhere there  are no added bonuses, but the DVD is still well worth purchasing. It is  the same quality as the Laser Disc version.
