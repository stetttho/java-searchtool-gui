 This very funny film fleshes out the book version of the History of White People.  However, you should also purchase the VHS History of White People Part II.  It is even funnier.  The sections on White Stress and White Crime  will have you reaching for the gumdrops and cheese wiz. The humor is on par  with The Producers. Don't just stand there- order the two videos!
