 While the sequence of events protrayed on film jumps around a bit, I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who is a space fan. The DVD is loaded with extra features, astronaut Id (useful when you cannot reconize  who is on the screen), full lenght commentary as an extra audio track, and  more goodies. The transfer is excellent.  The 5.1 audio is great and the  video is crisp and clean. I recomment it to you.
