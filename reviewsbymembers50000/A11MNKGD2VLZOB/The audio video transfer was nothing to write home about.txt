 The extra footage about the making of CaddyShack had Dolby 5.1 audio.  The movie itself was Dolby Center Channel with subwoofer.  I feel that Center Channel only provides better sound then just Stereo Front (L&R) only,  but I was still disappointed. If the original Star Trek TV series DVDs  can manage Dolby 5.1 (they sound great), I do not know why Caddy Shack  could not have been done better. The video transfer was ok.  There are  some "specks", as if you were watching an imperfect original.   But it is Caddy Shack, and therefore these defects can be overlooked.   But it was a poor showing  by Warner Brothers. I would purchase this only  if you are a Caddy Shack fan.
