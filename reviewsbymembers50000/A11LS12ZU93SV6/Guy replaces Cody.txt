 After Final Fight made it's Super Nintendo debut in or around 1990, Nintendo said in one of it's players' guides that the Super NES version included everything that made the arcade title a winner. Well, that was a matter of opinion, as Guy, the two-player mode, and a stage from the arcade game were removed, possibly due to memory constraints. Roxy, Poison, and alcoholic beverages were also removed from the American version. This, in addition to descrete graphical problems, caused the SNES title to sink while the SEGA CD version was much better recieved. Former pro-wrestler and newly elected mayor Mike Hagger recieves a threat from a gang called The Mad Gears when he refuses to be corrupted and take bribes (Like that would ever happen in real life!) in exchange for letting them run rampant: They kidnap his daughter, Jessica. What the Mad Gears don't know is that Hagger doesn't take kindly to threats, and Jessica's boyfriend, Cody, isn't too pleased either. In this version, Cody's away in Japan so Guy joins Hagger in the streets to fight the Mad Gears and get Jessica back safely. This is essentially another version of Final Fight for the SNES. While there are a few improvements graphically, the only major difference is that you get to play as Guy instead of Cody. It's funny how this story coincides with Jessie "The Body" Ventura's run and victory for governor of Minnesota. This story was written prior to Jesse's run.
