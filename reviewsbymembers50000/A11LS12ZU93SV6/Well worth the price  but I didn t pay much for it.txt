 This is the kind of game magazine editors warn you to stay away from. The graphics are sub-par, the camera is fixed (though that can be an advantage), the storyline [is bad], and you'll probably hate the music unless you're me. On the upside, Miranda does a good job of juicing up an over-used storyline. I mean, come on! An alien invasion?! Like that's never been done before!!
