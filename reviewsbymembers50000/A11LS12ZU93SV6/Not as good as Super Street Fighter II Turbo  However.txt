 Street Fighter rip-offs seem to get a bad rep: video games like Fatal Fury, Fighters History, Kat Fight, and TMNT Tournament Fighters have gotten mostly bad reviews , this being one of them. Double Dragon 5 is essentially a tournament fighting game based on a short-lived cartoon series that aired around the early-to-mid 1990's. I guess you could say it's a game based on a cartoon based on a game. The animation is a bit shabby and the moves are not very easy to pull off. I really don't know what else to write about this game. Street Fighter 2 set the bar at a level few fighting games were able to reach - notable exceptions include Mortal Kombat 1&2 and the Japanese Super Famicom Dragon Ball Z series. As a result, more recent fighting games such as Eternal Champions and Double Dragon V have become underrated.
