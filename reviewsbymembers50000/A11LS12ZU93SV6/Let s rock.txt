 If not for the insain level of difficulty found in this and others of its type, I would have given it five stars. The game takes place a few years after The Alien Wars (SNES) and you get your playing choice of a G.I.Joe-Duke-look-alike comando, a tough lady named Sheena (no, not Lady Sia!) who wears cyber-metalic lingerie and somewhat resembles Nova from StarCraft Ghost, a werewolf with a gatlin-gun for an arm, and a cycloptic robot named Brownie. Each characters starts out with a machine gun but gets his/her/its own set of additional weapons via power-ups. To sum this all up, it's a side-scroller that has you shooting everything up while trying not to get hit. You get 3 health points and 4 continues so be careful.
