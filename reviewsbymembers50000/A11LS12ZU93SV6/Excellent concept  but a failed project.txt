 I am an avid supporter of female athletes. That is why I decided to give Mia Hamm Soccer 64 a try. Unfortunately, unlike Mia Hamm, this game falls very short in execution: the controls are stiff, the announcer (with all due respect to Wendy) is too repetative, the graphics have a very low polygon count, and every athlete looks the same except for skin color. I admire South Peak Interactive for making what is apparently the second sports video game to star a woman (the first is Jennifer Capriatti Tennis for Sega Genesis), but they should have done more to make this game fun to play. Here's hoping they try again, but this time REALLY TRY.
