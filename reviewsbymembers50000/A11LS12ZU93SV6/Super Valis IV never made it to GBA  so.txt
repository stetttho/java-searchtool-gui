 Lady Sia can battle seemingly impossible odds with ease. No task is too difficult for her. Unfortunately, she's just a video game character. After searching for a used copy of Super Valis 4 for what seemed like an eternity, I finally found one . . . then I heard about this game. I decided I wasn't going to make the same mistake twice, and it wasn't rentable in my location so I just bought the dawm game. Not a mistake on my part, but definitely more difficult than I had hoped for. The game is fun, yes, but excruciatingly hard.  In the first few levels, you'll find yourself -should you play this game- adjusting to constant enemy attacks. The hard parts come in the later levels, with constant falling and unreliable bubbles that pop and drop you just a little too soon. The controls are flawless unless you're a nitpicker, the graphics are nice, and the animation is almost like water -- that's a good thing. The only real problem with the game is that it has a difficulty level comparable to the Contra games. I saw Lady Sia 2 listed in Nintendo Power magazine. If there really is going to be a sequel, I hope they make the necessary improvements. As for the story; You, as Lady Sia, are upset that a gang of misfits called Tsoas are ruining your towns and your council refuses to do anything about it. As you progress, you'll recieve some weapon upgrades, turn into monsters, and face some of your council. Oh. In case you're wondering, these are the basic controls: A= Jump B= Attack (press repeatedly for combo-style slashing) Select = I don't remember Start = pause/start Up = Look up; climb ladders, activate switches Down = Duck; Look down, climb down ladders Left = Run to the left (walk while holding L) Right = Run to the right (walk while holding L) L = Sneak (hold while pressing left or right) R = Slash (use in conjunction with B for special combos)
