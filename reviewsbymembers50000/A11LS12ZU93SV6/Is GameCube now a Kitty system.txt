 The assumption that Hello Kitty: Roller Rescue is only fun for young girls is a load of crap. Sure, it may have been designed with young girls in mind and it does have a cutesy aura and it is pretty short, but it's also fun as well, and it has the ability to attract male gamers over the age of 20. I should know; I happen to be one. That's not to say the game is perfect though. The music is hardly catchy, Kitty moves like she has gum stuck in her skates, and the gameplay isn't that challenging. It's basically a cheap clone of Super Mario 64 with less platform jumoing. You get a few sidekicks though. In the end, it's not that bad and it's not that great, but it isn't torture to play.
