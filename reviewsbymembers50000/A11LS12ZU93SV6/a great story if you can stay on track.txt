 Not to be confused with the film, "House on Haunted Hill", The House on the Hill is about a blind convict, living in a formerly condemned house, who's crime involved raping young girls. The tale is told non-narritvely through three characters: a cop, a mother, and her daughter.  If you're looking for a scary book, this is it. The situations of the kidnapped daughter are especially terrifying as you never know what is going to happen next. The only problem really is that the story can get confusing -- it took me awhile to figure out which house I was looking out of on the cover. I know that sounds lame, but it's just an example.
