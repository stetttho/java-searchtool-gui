 I would have given this CD at least three stars, maybe even five, if Disney didn't cut it up. Maybe I'm over-reacting but I bought this soundtrack for one reason and one reason only: the score that plays when Mulan lights the incense and prays to her ancestors, cuts her hair, and dons her father's armor. Well, that little synth piece was slashed right out!! Yeah, sure the rest of the music isn't all that bad, but this omission ruins everything!! EVERYTHING!!! I wasn't even sure I wanted to buy an entire soundtrack for just one song, and I didn't even get what I paid for. This review may be of no use to you, but before you ever buy a soundtrack again, make sure you get every piece of info on it first.
