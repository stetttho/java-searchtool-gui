 Of course she's evil! Why else would I listen to her? Seriously though, love her or hate her, she's not a multi-platinum artist for nothing. This first CD by the now infamous Princess of Pop reintroduces a genre that seemingly had been dead since Debbie Gibson and Cyndi Lauper hung their mics up. The first song on the CD begins with background acoustics and hard piano punches and ends in an almost rock-and-roll spirit. The rest of the songs go along the same line, with Britney seemingly begging for attention, even the abusive type. All in all though, I'd say she kicked her initial album off nicely. The others are a different story.
