 All the humor is this game might be amusing if not for the gawd-awful controls. Even after Conker sobers up, he still acts like he's drunk -- just like the developers. Thanks a lot, Rare!! You ruined my life!! Seriously though, I don't remember the controls being this bad, so maybe my controller's busted. The game opens with a tribute to Wendy Carlos' Clockwork Orange theme song and Conker sitting in a throne, about to explain how he became king of the land. "It was a bad fur day."  Next thing you know, Conker's in a bar leaving a message on Berri's answering machine. Berri is the grey chipmunk on the right side of the cover in the pink two-piece. The control-response starts out really bad because Conker is drunk stupid. Then things clear up a bit after he talks to a marijuana plant. From there on, things just seem to get weirder. Rare wanted to make a fairy tale parody with sick humor, and that's exactly what they did.
