 Babblin' Boo says about five different phrases: -"Mike Wisowski" (did I spell that right?) -some giggle like "Coo coodle de goo da li cup." That's the best I can do. -something that sounds like "Baby comes along, wants to sing this song, wanna lemon kind." Doesn't make any sense, but that's what I heard. -"Kitty" -giigle You can make her babble, so to speak, by pressing a button in the center of her naval. Boo also comes with a monster doll. I'm telling you this in case there is no picture available. Hidden in her chest above the belly, I believe is a type of magnet. When the eye of her monster gets close enough to the magnet, she giggles. Take the monster away and she screams. You can strap the doll to Boo's wrist. Boo's attire consists of two hair beads, a pink shirt, purple pants, and two white socks. The shirt is not removable unless you cut the collar -- if the shirt gets dirty, this could be a problem. All in all, I'd say Boo is great for any child or adult, depending on your taste. I gave her three stars for education value because I don't know how you can learn from her, and five stars for durability because mine didn't break when I packed her away for travel. One more thing: I recommend not untying Boo's hair. It connects from a central line and the outlines of her scalp. If you take the beads out, I can almost guarantee she will look funny, though the hair shouldn't be too difficult to fix with some patience.
