 You're Samus Aran on your third (and best) video game adventure as you return to the ruins of planet Zebes. A side-scroller second only to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Super Metroid can blast with the best of'em, with 7 massive areas, 5 different weapons, a grappling beam, x-ray vision (no, you cannot peak through her armor!), a swirly-swirl attack that enables Samus to soar through the air, a jumping ball-curl, tons of well-detailed underling anemies, and several excellently-detailed boss enemies. . . are you still with me? You go all the way from the surface of Zebes, through an abandoned space station and dark tunnels and lots of water, to the extremely hot pits of the planets core, where you fight the infamous Mother Brain. I'm not giving anything else away though. You have to play this plastic little gem yourself. Now for the bad stuff: like all her known previous adventures, Samus goes this one alone and, unlike the the Nintendo Power comic, does not interact with any other characters. This, in my opinion, can make the game feel kind of lonely, especially when there is also no sunshine to brighten the area.  But like the ratings I gave it, this is a 5-star game and should be fun throughout the ages. Besides, it stars the arguably best (and best female) video game character to date. Go for it!!
