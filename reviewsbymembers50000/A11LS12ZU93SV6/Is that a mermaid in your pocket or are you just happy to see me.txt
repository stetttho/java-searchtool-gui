 This is really just the NES version with only four colors (four shades of either green or grey if you're playing it on the original GB or GB Pocket). You trap enemies in bubbles then throw them at walls, other enemies, or nothing at all. You can enhance the distance and the effect of your bubbles with power-ups. There's really nothing more to this title. It's easy and fun, but once you beat it, there's really nothing left to do except play it again. You could look for hidden forks, pipes, and other stuff from Ariel's grotto, but what fun is that?
