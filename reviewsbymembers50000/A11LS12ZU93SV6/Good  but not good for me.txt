 If you read my review of the first Metroid game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, you know that just because Samus Aran is my favorite bounty hunter does not mean I'm going to give high marks to all her games. I don't know if I should even be reviewing this game, but here goes anyway... This game plays essentially like the GameCube Metroid video games, except that the movement is easier if you can handle the touch-screen. That's where I have a problem. Whether I use the stylus or the strap with the plastic button, I just can't seem to get the hang of this game, which is a real shame since using the duel-buttons control method is not as precision-acurate. I like the online play too. I'm not sure there really is a voice chat option in the game as some sources had promised, but it's fun anyway, if you can stand getting blasted away multiple times by more experience players than yourself for the first twenty-or-so rounds. It's almost like Halo 2 when your at a wi-fi hotspot as opposed to being in front of the television. I guess that's not much of a compensation unless you like playing video games at designated McDonalds retsaurants. The single-player mode is okay, but the rarity of save points hurts the gameplay, especially if you've gotten far and suddenly get sick of the current control set-up. I thought the checkpoints were save points, but they're not, so I had to start all over again.
