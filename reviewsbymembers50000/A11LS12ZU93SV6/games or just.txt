 Let's see what we have here. 5 original titles: ~ Pac Man ~ Dig Dug ~ Pole Position  ~ Galaga ~ Pac Attack (an original in this case because the gameplay does not resemble any other NAMCO game) 4 sister titles: ~ Ms. Pac Man ~ Galaxian ~ Pole Position 2 ~ Pac Mania and 3 enhancments: ~ Dig Dug Arranged ~ Pac Man Arranged ~ Galaga Arranged and you can only play Pac Attack and Pac Mania once you have unlocked them -- 20,000 points in Pac Man for Pac Mania; 10,000 points in Ms. Pac Man for Pac Attack, or is it the other way around? Anyway, that's what you get, all of them in arcade-perfect condition. Since I love Ms. Pac so much, I would have taken Pac Man out and put a completely different game in, assuming 12 was my maximum. Fans of NAMCO Museum Volume 3 will may be dissapointed that there is no virtual museum to walk around and look at stuff. Sorry. I'll still recommend this package to any classic NAMCO fan simply because it's a part of history that should never be forgotten, and it's available on all three of the latest video game consoles as of September 29th, 2003.
