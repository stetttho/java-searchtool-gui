 I bet you get sick of seeing the word "frustrating" or "frustrated" in my reviews. I'm sorry, but that's the way, most of the games I run into are. The game has silky-smooth graphix and rocky-rough animation, meaning the characters and areas are beautiful, but the the moving sprites seem to use only two frames of animation per task (running to an enemy and then whacking it are 2 different tasks). Thankfully, the Full-Motion-Video cutscenes are done well considering that they're Anime-style. The gameplay is great most of the time but -you guessed it- gets excruciatingly difficult at innapropriate times. Try fighting your very first enemy and you'll probably see what I mean. The storyline is set approximately 1000 years after the first game, give or take a few months, and your center of control is a slightly-less-annoying-than-Alex little brat who goes by the name of Hiro. The blue-haired girl in the maroon cloak and baret is Lucia, an alien sorcoress you have no control over even in battle mode. The pink cat-like creature (who will try to tear your face off if you call her a cat to her face) is Ruby, a baby dragon with a smartmouth whom you'll either learn to love or hate throughout the game. The good news is that Ruby is more helpful than Nall, Alex's pet dragon from the first game because Ruby actually attacks enemies where-as Nall only healed fallen allies randomly. The story itself revolves around Hiro trying to help Luna (who suffered from amnesia) find her true self while investigating strange activities by the Goddess Althena. Hardcore fans of Lunar: The Silver Star Story will be happy to know that there will be at least two returning characters (three if you count Althena herself) but alas I cannot tell you who they are or my review may not be approved by the Amazon staff. Besides, why should I spoil the surprise?
