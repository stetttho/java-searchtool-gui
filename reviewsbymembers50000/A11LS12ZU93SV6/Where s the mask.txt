 I don't know if you really care but, contrary to the cover, the phantom in this film does not wear a mask (though judging from his horse-like face, maybe he should!). Personally, I think the movie itself is worse than any face a mask would ever hide. The plot is tampered with in the worst ways, the intimate scenes (which shouldn't even be there) are horribly scripted, and Christine's boyfriend is a complete jerk! Seriously, I can't think of any reason why anyone would want to make a POTO movie this way! I'm not even talking about the mask now, though the mask itself was somewhat symbolic in the original story. This is about taking a story and ripping virtually everything good from it. Yes ,there are some good parts, but they are few and far between.
