 I don't know why this review is showing twice. Website glitches, I guess.  Now where were we? Oh yeah, I just finished (sort of) reviewing the Genesis version. It's no surprise Konami made most of their non-sports titles different for every system in those days. You can't play as Robin, okay? The game was originally going to be called Batman: The Animated Series, but the game's title changed with the show. I don't remember where Robin fits in, but I think he was kidnapped by Harley Quinn's "puddin" Mister J. The SNES version is much slower than the Genesis', but that's not really a bad thing; it gives you time to think, which is actually required here. That's all I remember. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!!  GO AWAY!!  GET OUT!! LEAVE ME ALONE!!
