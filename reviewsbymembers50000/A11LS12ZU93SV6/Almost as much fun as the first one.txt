 It's too bad Konami never released an arcade-perfect version of the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game on the SNES. Actually this one isn't a perfect translation either, as it's missing some digitized voices. A playable April wouldn't have hurt either, but at least she doesn't get kidnapped. Anywho, although the title may be (sic) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time, that's only because there were three TMNT games previously released on the original Nintendo Entertainment System (not counting Tournament Fighters). This is actually the second game released in the arcades. Now for the actual review. The game takes you through, uh, I dunno, 15-or-so levels of repetitive non-stop action (double entendre? you decide). As usual, you get to choose between Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael (sorry, Venus, you weren't here yet). The subtitle, Turtles in Time, comes into play when you almost defeat Shredder and then are hurled back through time to 100,000,000,000,000-or-so B.C., then forward to 15??, 18??, 20??, 2???, then back to 1993 where you fight Shredder for supposedly the last time. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!
