 The first thing I noticed when I watched this film was reoccurance of "panty shots" that don't seem to fit in any way except for sexual spice. For example; in a scene where a woman is guiding a tour on a boat, the view suddenly switches momentarily to an angle that looks up her skirt at her underwear. Anyway, the plot is unoriginal (a couple of spy girls investigate some weirdo organization) and the story seems to drag (some scenes take too long). It IS interesting though, so I do recommend renting it. Just don't buy it until you know what you're getting into (no pun intended).
