 Bad music, carnivorism (I'm a vegetarian), and a sachrine-sweet atmosphere. So what makes this movie so great? It's wake-up call to anyone who still thinks interracial relationships are taboo. Seriously though, it sets a good message despite the dude being about 15 years older, it's hillarious (especially the dance scene with the maid's assistant and the deli delivery boy), and Katharine Houghton is NOT a bad actress, despite what others may say. I think she plays her over-enthusiastic character quite well. This review is not sarcasm, I assure you. No, I don't support the killing of animals, but that's such a small part of the story (turtle soup and deli) that it's hardly worth mentioning. A great move made in a time of racial turmoil. This may have even inspired the kiss between Captain Kirk and Communications Officer O'Hura.
