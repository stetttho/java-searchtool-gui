 I'm a fan of the old Laurell K. Hamilton. That being said, I'm rather disappointed in A Kiss of Shadows. It seems as though one of my favorite authors is losing interest in "fiction fantasy" and taking interest in "sexual fantasy". There are a few fantasy elements here and there, but in the end, this is just another sex book.
