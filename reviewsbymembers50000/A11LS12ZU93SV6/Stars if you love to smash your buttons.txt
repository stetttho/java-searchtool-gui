 The problem with analog controllers is that they can be misused by developers. Jet Set Radio Future was a victim, and so is the X-Box version of Soul Calibur 2 -- meaning simply tapping the buttons won't get you any response. Everyone I talked to doesn't notice this in either game, so maybe I'm just crazy or have gotten defective copies. As for the game itself, Soul Calibur 2 is little more than another scenario along with Soul Calibur [1] and Soul Edge. The controls remain untouched (I'm not making a stupid joke either): Block, [Normal] Attack, Vertical Strike, kick, and Power-Up. Also, jumping isn't a simple matter of pressing Up. You have to press an attack button too, and press it hard. If you aren't irritated by having to press-hard buttons like I do, the X-Box version is the best one to get. After all, it features Spawn. Although Spawn isn't the best character in the game (that honor, in my opinion, goes to either Ivy or Inferno), he's the best exclusive character. How this version compares to the others in other areas, however, is unbeknownst to me. I did do graphical comparisons between the X-Box game and a GameCube playable demo, and noticed that the GameCube version's graphics were slightly richer. Maybe it's different when you use an S-Video. I haven't touched the PS2 version yet. Bottom line: If you don't have sensitive fingers, get the X-Box version. Otherwise, I hear the GameCube version is the best, control-wise.
