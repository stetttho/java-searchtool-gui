 This is technically the most powerful video gaming console as of October 27th, 2003. While it may not have the most or the best video games, it does have something the Gamecube and Playstation 2 don't have: a built-in hard drive. Okay, so maybe the PS2 will have a hard drive available soon, but that's another story. Anyway, the hard drive enables gamers to play their own music in select video games such as "Dead Or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball" and "Sega GT 2002". While the X-Box is more powerful than the PS2 and GC, the differences aren't that noticable -- at least to me. In fact, I thought the graphics in the Gamecube version of Soul Calibur 2 (on a playable demo disk) were somewhat more pleasing to the eyes than the X-Box version's. That's just one game though. I'd tell you more, but there's not much to tell. I believe you may get more info in that area from some of these other reviewers. My personal recommendations for X-Box are "Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat," "Dead Or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball," "Bloodrayne," and "Soul Calibur 2." On a side note, I got my X-Box when the bundle had "Jet Set Radio Future" and "Sega GT 2002". My bundle didn't include an X-Box Live trial subscription, but that would not have done me any good because I only have dial-up. I never played "Tetris Worlds Online" or "Star Wars: The Clone", so I don't have any take on those games. Also, in case you are reading this review from a source other than Amazon.com, which I found to be the case with Barbie: Treasures in Time, I must warn you if you don't already know that a DVD Playback Kit (or possibly a hacking tool) you won't be able to view DVD movies on the X-Box. A little advice: Some games (such as Dead or Alive 3 and Xtreme Beach Volleyball) can't have their data saved to a memory unit. Taking extra care of your X-Box is essential because if you ever have to replace it, you can kiss some of your saved game data goodbye.
