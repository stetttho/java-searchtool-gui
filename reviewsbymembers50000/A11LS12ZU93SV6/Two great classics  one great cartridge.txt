 What you see is what you get with Tetris & Dr. Mario. As should have been the case with the official NES version, Tetris is now two-players. Not that ridiculous fake 2-player with a Game Genie where one player moves the blocks while the other rotates, but head-to-head VS. The music in Tetris is a 16-bit representation of the GameBoy version, so music A (Sugarplumb Fairy) and C from NES is not there. Sorry. Dr. Mario is essentially the same as the NES version, except for 16-bit graphics and music. You still have the two tunes, Fever and Chill. There is a third mode in this cart aimed at two-play. You start in one game, then go to the other. It's neat, but nothing special. The controls remain faithful to there NES and GameBoy counterparts which can be good or bad. -Crosspad moves pills in Dr. Mario, blocks in Tetris, and selector in the menu screens. -Button advances in the menu screens and rotates obects clockwise in both games. -Button B cancels in menu screens and rotates objects counter-clockwise in both games. -Start pauses the game. -The Y, X, L, R, and Select buttons do nothing.
