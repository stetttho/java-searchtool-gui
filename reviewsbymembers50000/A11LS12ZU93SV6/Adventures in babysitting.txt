 There's nothing technically wrong with DKC3:DK'sDT.  I mean, it's a great platformer, but it has a tendancy to seem more like a chore than actual fun.  Dixie Kong returns front-and-center from her co-starring role in Diddy's Kong Quest, and nothing's changed about her.  That's good news because she can still whack enemies with her hair and glide like a helicopter.  That's bad news because she can't take-out some bigger enemies, so she needs the help of her overweight brat, Kiddy Kong.
