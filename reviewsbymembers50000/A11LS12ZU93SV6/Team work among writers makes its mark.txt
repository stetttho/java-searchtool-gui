 No, I don't believe in cruelty to animals. That being said, I think this is one great book. Hard to read, yes, but very rewarding if you like solid sci-fi with a balanced amount of action, suspense, and drama. There are also tiny sprinkles of mystery here and there. The story begins when an African-American transport pilot (Joyce, I think her name is) makes her way to a space rock/station. There, she catches up with an old friend, both unaware that professor Ernst Kleist is up to very evil experiments. The title, Rogue, comes from a domestic alien bred by Kleist himself. That's all I'm saying cuz I don't want to spoil anything. This book is somehwat of a departure from the Alien movies (not just because Ripley's not even mentioned) but it's equally as good. Pay no attention to any ads for other books that say stuff like "If you liked Aliens Rogue...". This story is one of a kind.
