 Fall of the Foot Clan is a side-scroller in its most basic and simple form: this can be a good thing or a bad thing. Unless you have never played a video game before in your life, there will be little if any difficulty completing this one. There are five levels, four turtles, three bonus games, and a handful of enemies. Let me break it down like this:   Graphics: 5 of 10   Gameplay: 4 of 10      Sound: 7 of 10 Innovation: 1 of 10  Storyline: 2 of 10        Fun: 9 of 10 + familiar characters, nice music (especially in level 5), cartoony graphics, mini-games - too easy, no female turtle (no Venus), April is not playable, turtles walk slowly
