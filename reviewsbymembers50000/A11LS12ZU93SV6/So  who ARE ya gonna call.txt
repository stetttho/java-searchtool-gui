 I don't know if I remember this game well enough to give an accurate review, but here goes: This is another basic side-scroller where ya go around and eliminate enemies. I think the game takes place entirely in Dana Barett's apartment complex, and you have to keep watching out for the Stay-Puffed Marshmellow Man (person, but he was called a man) who, uh. . . I think he either grabs you or shoots lasers from his eyes. . . either way, he attacks through windows from the outside. The ghostbusters have heads that are almost as big as their toony bodies, which looks pretty hilarious in my opinion.
