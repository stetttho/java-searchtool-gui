 Great video games based on DC Comics are few and far between. Luckily, this one isn't so bad. It's basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up in the Superman universe. In addition to Superman, you also get to play as Super Cyborg, The Eradicator, Superboy, and Steel, depending on where you are in the game. Unfortunately, you can't play as Super Girl (surprise, surprise), a female version of Superman with a skirt and a valuable asset (no pun intended). + Solid hard-hitting action - Can't play as Super Girl
