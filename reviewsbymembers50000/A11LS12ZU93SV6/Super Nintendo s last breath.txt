 When someone insults a next-generation video game's graphics with something like, "It could have easily been done on SNES," she or he may not remember Donkey Kong Country. Even on on X-Box, GameCube, PS2, or that Phantom thingy, the graphics on this baby are no insult. The CG resolution is crystal-clear and the animation in unparalelled. The rain fits perfectly and the transition of weather is flawless. The music isn't bad either . . . it's great, from Funky Kong's theme and the water stages to Candy's lovable romance beat and the final battle with King K. Rool. Both graphics and sound really push the SNES to its limits. As for the gameplay, that's great too. The difficulty can challenge and even frustrate you, but you'll be coming back for more. If I have to say anything bad about the game, Dixie Kong is not here yet and there are no digitized voices. There are grunts and cries, but no actual words.
