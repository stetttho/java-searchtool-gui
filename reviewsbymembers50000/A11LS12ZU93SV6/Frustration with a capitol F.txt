 You know that feeling you get when you finally accomplish an almost impossible task, have a few moments of gratification, and then realize there was no point because it was never fun? Well, I would call it playing Super Mario Sunshine, but that might be just a little too narrow. I'm not saying that nothing in SMS (akronym) is easy, but there are so many frustrating points, it takes 90% of the fun out of the game. You wanna know what else I hate about the game? Just like in Super Mario 64, the camera makes the game harder than it needs to be, and you have to rescue the princess . . . AGAIN!! Come on, Miyamoto, this is the 21st century!... God, I hate sexual profiling. I could be as guilty as anyone for pressuring Miyamoto into making another Mario adventure game when he wasn't ready, so I hope we've all learned a lesson from this. Okay, you've read my two-cents. Now you can read all the happy-go-lucky reviews that tell you how this game is such a "masterpiece."
