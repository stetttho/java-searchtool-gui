 I wanted to be one of the few people to give this game a good review. Unfortunately, I would just be lying. Bebe's Kids could have been a great game if not for the many neucanses that plague it. I don't mind that the game is a Final Fight clone or that the resolution looks comparable to a Sega Master System game. What bug me are the slow animation, loopy-short music, and lack of variety. As anyone who's seen the movie may have guessed, the game takes place at Fun World, an amusement park with too many rules. I would tell you more, but I stopped playibng after only a few seconds.
