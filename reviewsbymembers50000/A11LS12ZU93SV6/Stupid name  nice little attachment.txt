 Everyone who got into video games prior to 1990 most likely remembers SEGA CD. It was a great add-on and probably would have sold millions if not for two little problems: The $300 price tag and the fact that you couldn't use it without the then $150 Sega Genesis, sold separately. The Game Boy Player sells for about a half-a-Benjamin Franklin, requires no additional AC power plug, and can be secured tightly to the Gamecube's bottom with two metal screws. Worried that the analog in the shoulder-buttons might make L&R actions a little slippery? Not a problem. You can assign the GBA's L&R fuctions to the Y and X buttons on the Gamecube controller. Unfortunately for LAN (Local Area Network Fans), the manual states that connecting multiple GBP's together with link cables won't work. I haven't tested that theory, but I haven't known Nintendo to lie about these sorts of things. Luckilly, you can still plug other GBAs into the GBP via cables for multi-player fun. Remember, it's the game-link cable, not the GBA-to-GC cable. Unfortunately, the GBP does not seem to work with PS2 controllers connected through third-party adapters from Nyko or Innovation. Also, some games, such as Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 (confused yet?), allow rumbling. Cool. Okay, that little piece from Children's Software Revue made absolutely zero sense. In case it's gone by the time you read this, it said, "This fun, complex, humorous and creative flying simulation sends players on missions to exotic places, as they compete in flying dogfights or stunt flying missions. "Pretty funny" content includes 13 characters, eight songs, and different locations. For 1 or 2 players in head-to-head combat. The Teen rating comes from the suggestive themes of the busty babes, and the overall fighting theme." It's not a flying similator, there are no busty babes, or what-have-you. It must be for some video game. Now I'm curoious. Must be a really diverse game.
