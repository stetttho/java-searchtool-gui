 Long ago in the ancient city of Oedo (or was it just Edo?). . . ah, forget it. Here's the scoop! The game is both a  multi-scroller (meaning you can go up and down as well as left and right) and a side-scroller, depending on what part of the game you are in. The Legend of the Mystical Ninja is a whacky action-adventure video game and has to be one of the best to hit the Super NES. In addition to whacking baddies with a drain-pipe, wet towel, flute, or yo-yo, you get to play lots of fun mini-games and travel across ancient Japan in search of whatever. I have only four complaints: the game can get too hard, Goemon was renamed Kid Ying, Ebisumaru was renamed Dr. Yang, and my favorite female ninja, Yae, is not playable. Sorry if this review seems a little vague. I'd tell you the storyline but there really isn't one.  I also recommend Pocky and Rocky -- if you can find it  Amazon!! Get your pictures straight! This is not Pro Evolution Soccer 4!!
