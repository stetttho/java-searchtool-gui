 I bought this CD after being tipped off that the song "Peek-A-Boo" is what was playing during the highway scene in the movie, "Jeepers Creepers" and was unable to activate the sound samples on this website. The words are pretty much the same, but the mix is completely unlike the pop-rock version in the movie. Now, about the CD itself: Anyone who's heard the song "Face 2 Face" during the dancing scene in Batman Returns should know how Siouxsie sings. After calming down from my anger, I actually started to grow fond of Peek-A-Boo and it's weird instrumentals of whistles, parade drums, and saxaphones. My other favorite is Carousel, which actually hints of old carnival music mixed with a touch of horror.  The rest of the songs are forgettable.
