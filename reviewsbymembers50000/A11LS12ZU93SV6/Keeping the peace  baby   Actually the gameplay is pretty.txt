 ...stiff.  Without a doubt, this is definitely a better game than Jaleco's earlier release, Rival Turf.  That's not saying much, though, as Rival Turf was one of the worst scroll-to-the-right-and-beat-the-hell-out-of-em video games I have ever played in 22 years.  The gameplay is stiffer than Larry Flynt's... well, you get the idea.  One redeeming factor in this game (besides the playable girl) is the texture-edit mode.  If you know what the hell you are doing, you can actually adjust the textures of most of the characters in the game to your liking.  It's good for a mindless street fighting game but I wouldn't pay more than eight bucks for it.
