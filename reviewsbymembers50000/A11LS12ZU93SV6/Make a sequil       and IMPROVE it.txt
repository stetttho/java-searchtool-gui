 Congratulations: You found the GameCube version of Blood Rayne. Yep, it's still available... If you're one of those gamers who are looking for more blood and gore, you're going to find it here. The game takes place in the 1930's, but if Agent Bloodrayne is still alive (this may be just a game, but there is no proof that she doesn't really exist) and has a Gamecube herself, she's probably be hopping mad that this version got short-changed. When I played an X-Box demo, I noticed some things there that were missing from the GC version: extra textures on Rayne's costume and darthish (work with me here, people!) voices to match the slow-motion.  I don't know about the extra textures, but you don't need an X-Box to slow the speed of someone's voice (play TUROK on N64 with a Big Heads cheat). + Female Hero; lot's of blood; Nazi-killing (if you're not a neo-nazi gamer); Rayne says "F--k" on a Nintendo console; Rayne's outfit; cheat codes; nice tunes (they're in there, you just have to listen carefully) - faulty controls (you have to press the shoulder buttons in until they click to get any response); lack of control options; can't rescue Jewish prisoners; can't fight Hitler; Rayne's lines can get repetative; missing textures from X-Box (and possibly PS2) version. Also, there is a sequil planned for X-Box and PlayStation 2, and PC, but a GameCube version is not likely. Sorry, GameCube fans, I love her too.
