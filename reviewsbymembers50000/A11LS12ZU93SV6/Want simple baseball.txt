 Bad News Baseball fits into the category of "simple yet effective" because that's exactly what it is. The most complicated thing you'll have to do is pick your players according to their attributes. The physics are about as groundbreaking as a foam jackhammer, but you'll probably be too busy cussing at foul plays to notice. Personally, I found this game fun. I bought it for the female-players code (Hold DOWN and LEFT on controller 1 while holding UP on controller 2 and press RESET on the console; you may need to do this more than once for it to work) because I thought it sounded cool. It could have been just my imagination, but it seemed to me that the girls were faster and had better AI than the boys -- a bold feminist statement by TECMO before Dead Or Alive, maybe? I hope Amazon allows this review and doesn't censor the code I've provided because that's pretty much the coolest part of the game. If you ARE reading this but don't see a code, look it up.
