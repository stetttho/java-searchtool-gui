 This will be the first time Barbie has ever appeared on a Nintendo video game console since the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Even though I thought the PSOne demo of Barbie Explorer lacked a video game necessity called "fun", I can't wait to play this one. Now if only they'd make an African American or Hispanic Barbie video game. The game keeps getting delayed. Also, Vivendi is undergoing some changes, according to news sources such as GameSpot, so there really is no guarantee that Barbie TiT will ever make it to stores. Too bad, really. I was looking forward to this one.
