 Although I am not a fan of DOA's, Virtua Fighter's, Tekken's, and other "modern fighting games'" play mechanics, I was actually considering buying this game. I'm glad I rented it instead.  This was supposed to be a remake of both Dead Or Alive 1 and 2 with upgrades. Instead, Dead or Alive Ultimate ends up as just another port. Sure it has extra outfits and stages and online play for those who can afford the excruciating monthly broaband fees, but it fixes none of the information problems in training mode, the characters are hard to control, and the optional English Language Dialogue that was in DoA 2 Hardcore for the PlayStation 2 has been stripped from the X-Box version. As for the Dead or Alive series in general, if I want confusing combo moves, I'll play one of those stupid dancing games. I hope this isn't the future of fighting games and that "Street Fighter" gameplay will come back again.
