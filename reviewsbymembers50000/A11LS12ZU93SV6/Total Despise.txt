 Like, oh my god! This game totally sucks (...)I thought there was gonna be fighting and stuff. Instead it's, like, a tedious, watered-down Metal-Gear-rip-off! I so wanna crush the cartridge and set it on fire! I'm sending this game straight back to GameFly, if I don't mistake it for the piece of crap it is and flush it down the toilet first. Too bad. I really wanted a Totally Spies video game.
