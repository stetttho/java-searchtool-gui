 You've probably heard/read from many magazines and reviewers that the Nintendo 64 is comparable to the House of Usher: fallen. But the truth is that Nintendo 64 has a lot to offer. She doesn't have as many games her cousin, the Sony Playstation, but the N64 can hold her own in the console wars with exlcusive hits like Super Mario 64, Perfect Dark, and Wave Race 64 to name a few. Nintendo 64's main weakness has been that she uses cartridges instead of CDs: cartridges are more expensive and would cost billions to hold as much memory as CDs. Should you decide to purchase this system (if you haven't already), here is a list of my recommended games: Super Mario 64 Perfect Dark Banjo-Kazooie Banjo-Tooie Mischief Makers Wave Race 64 Goemon's Great Adventure Diddy Kong Racing These are just a few games. Experiment a bit and see what suits you.
