 It'll be a cold day in hell before I support our troops' war on terrorism. That being said, Desert Strike isn't so bad for a helicopter game. You control the chopper from a 3/4 down perspective, using left and right to turn, and up and down to move forward or back. Your arsenal consists of a machine gun, rockets, and missiles. The controls are cumbersom at first, but you'll get used to them if you don't get bored first. Having only sampled Jungle Strike and Urban Strike, never playing Nuclear Strike, and not knowing of any more of these obnoctious titles, I really have nothing to compare this to, unless you want to hear about... uh, that other helicopter game for Genesis. I'll tell you when I remember. You probably know what I'm talking about.
