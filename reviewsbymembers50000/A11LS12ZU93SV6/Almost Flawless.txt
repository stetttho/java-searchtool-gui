 Anyone worried about possible censorships can put that to rest. Everything's here, from the machine-guns, through Michaelangello's nunchukues, to the Japanese shuriken throwing star. This DVD contains the first five episodes from the series that started in 1987, plus four bonus episodes featuring the Turtles' last arch-nemesis, Dregg. Alright, let's get the minor bad stuff out of the way. The screen occasionally jumps but doesn't lose picture. There is also one point where the screen goes completely blank for about one second. Thankfully, that one second is nothing except part of the technodrome blasting through rocks. No big deal unless you're an obsessed collector. Fans might also be dissapointed that that special features are nill. I personally would like to have seen profiles of the characters. The last flaw is that the bonus episodes are shown in the wrong order. That's all. Those who did not watch the series to its end may notice in the bonus episodes that Michaelangello now uses a grappling hook instead of nunchukues. That is because nunchukues are banned in some parts of Europe, where the show also aired. I highly recommend this to everyone who was a fan of the first animated series. Here's hoping Artisan and Family Home Entertainment do another installment.
