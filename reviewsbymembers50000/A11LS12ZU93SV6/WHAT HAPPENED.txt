 In an effort to sabotage Catwoman's reputation, Vatical and Kemco conspired to create of one the worst video games imaginable so that no developer would ever touch her liscence again. Before I played this game, I was hoping for a playing style similar to Batman: The Video Game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Unfortunately, what I got was a clunky, barely playable insult to one of my favorite DC heroes/villains. Not only is Selena Kyle unable to attack while air-borne, she can't even move when she's not on the ground. Okay, so you can swing across ceilings, but that's the extent of it. The gameplay is monotonous and the animation is poorly done, not even exceptable by South Park standards. If there is one thing Catwoman can do that others can't in their own games, it's sidestep into the background. I hope this [game] doesn't discourage developers from making a newer, much better game starring the infamous cat burgaler.
