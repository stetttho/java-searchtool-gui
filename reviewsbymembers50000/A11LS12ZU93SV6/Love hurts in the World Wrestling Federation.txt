 The bad news is that Bam Bam Bigalow and Yokozuna have been removed from the actual arcade version, leaving the number of wrestlers the same as the first Wrestlemania video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Bam Bam would have been the only character in both games. Other than that and the fact that everyone's favorite sexually ambiguous pro-wrestler, Luna Vachon (What? You thought I was gonna say Chyna?), is not included in any version of this game, everything's cool. Well, I'd rather the blood was red instead of blue, but otherwise it's cool. The good news is that you get corny yet pillow-muffled commentary from Vince McMahon and Jerry Lawler and action that is faster paced than WWF Raw (not the X-Box version). Each wrestler has his own set of gag moves; Razor Ramon attacks with hands that turn into blades, Doink beats clowny stuff out of his opponents, and Bret Hart... okay, so not everyone has gag moves. The Undertaker and Shawn Michals have nothing special, but Lex Luger attacks with metal arms. I don't know if this happened before or after Mortal Kombat 3, but this does resemble Jax and the two of them both have rude pompous all-American attitudes. Anyway, that's my review and I'm not sticking to it. As for the phrase in my review title, yes, it was taken from the commercial, and no, I don't know the rest of the words or where to find the commercial.
