 This is a polygonal beat-em-up game along the lines of Fighting Force and Hidden Invasion. And like those two, it's a horrible game. The camera is sloppy. Not as bad as Hidden Invasion, but it can sometimes get stuck at inappropriate places (I ain't talkin' in a good way either!), and you have no control over it. The gameplay is monotonous. You knock thugs around and then follow an arrow to where you beat more people up. At some point in the stage, you press the A button to activate a switch or call another Angel. The controls are awkward. Once again, the analog shoulder buttons are used at full disadvantage: you have to press them all the way in until they click. On the default control set-up, you jump with B, punch with Y, kick with X, pick stuff up with A, focus on an enemy with R, switch targets with Z, and temporarily power-up with L. This setting can be frustrating when trying to perform an arial attack. You can also switch the actions of B and X, but that doesn't really make things easier. If you have to know, the Start button pauses the game and brings up a menu, the control stick moves the Angel, and the cross-pad and yellow C-stick do nothing as far as I remember. The music is so-so, with various techno-tunes and a louzy digital song at the Start Menu. You can access bonus features, such as a Teaser, photos, and...uh, I can't remember what else, by collecting CDs and memory sticks scattered around the areas. You can also watch each computer-generated Full-Motion Video piece as many times as you want after you get to that part in the game. The character models might pass for okay on an earlier console, but on today's systems, I expect more polygons and better textures. The outfits aren't too bad though. I don't recommend buying this game or even playing it. If you have to satisfy your curiosity like I did, try a rental.
