 I never played the original Bionic Commando, so I cannot acurately compare it to this remake. What I'm told, though, is that the female commando is new.  This is essentially a mission-based side-scroller that also stems to occasional bloody sniper-modes and some omni-scrolling. The play-control is done rather well, except that you cannot jump. Instead, you have to use your grappling arm to get from one platform to another, which can make for unnecessary dificulty. There is also a lot of maze work in some levels, forcing you to run in circles before actually getting from point A to point B and so forth. As for the commandos themselves, the "Johnny Knocksville" male commando and the "X-Woman Psylocke" female differ only in looks. The choice is probably based on your preference for gender. I usually play as the female even though I'm male, but maybe that's just me. The storyline is simple: a former bionic commando loses his temper and decides he wants to destroy the government that created him. At least that's what I remember. You are a new commando sent to stop the evil cyborg at all costs. As you progress, you will collect new weapons and items. Most of the items are merely requirements to complete your mission while the new weapons simply make you more powerful. You may also collect other enhancements such as a pair of steel boots to knock your enemies out while swinging.
