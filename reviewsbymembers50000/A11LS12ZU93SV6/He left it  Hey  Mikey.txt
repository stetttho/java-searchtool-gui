 I don't know why Nintendo made this game, especially considering most poeple would love to beat ol' Mike Tyson up now more than ever! It's essentially Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! without Mike Tyson -you fight some pasty blonde guy named Mister Dream instead. I guess Nintendo's contract ran out (or something) when Nintendo still wasn't ready to stop selling the game. Also, Great Tiger is now Glass Tiger. The controls are simple enough: A & B are punch buttons (holding Up while pressing either one results in a face-punch), Left and Right are for dodging, Down is for blocking (double-tap Down to duck), and Start is for a Super Punch provided you have at least one star. Unfortunately, you cannot pause the game so bathroom breaks must be taken between fights or rounds. As stated in my review of MTPO* (which Amazon.com may not have posted since I used a contraversial word), you play as Little Mac and your opponents are...  * Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! In order of appearance: Glass Joe, a wuss who gives the French a bad name; Von Kaiser, a former boxing instructor from Germany; Piston Honda, an angry Japanese boxer; Don Flaminco, a flamboyant Spaniard who loves a woman named Carmen (San Diego perhapse?); King Hippo, a human tub of lard who wears size XXXL shorts and cannot get up once he is knocked down; Glass Tiger, an East-Indian with magic powers and a jewel (possibly The Eye of the Tiger) encrested into his turban; Bald Bull, an oddly familiar-looking fighter from Turkey; Soda Popinski, a soft-drink fanatic who loves soda and looks somewhat like Bald Bull except he's thinner and wears a speedo instead of shorts; Mr. Sandman, a classic 50's-looking African American with mean uppercuts; Super Macho Man, a self-absorbed champion with a thornado punch; and finally Mr. Dream, a Kurt-Angle look-alike reject who can knock you down with just one uppercut.
