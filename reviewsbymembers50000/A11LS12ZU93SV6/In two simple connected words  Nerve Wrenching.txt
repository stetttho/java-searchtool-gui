 I hate this book!! That being said, you're probably wondering why I gave it five stars. The answer: it is so well-written that I might read it again, even as I ever-so loathe its contents. V.C. Andrews does a fantastic job of thrusting the horror of this spine-tingling tale right into the reader's head -- atleast that's the effect it had on me! As the four children were kept locked away in a room for over four years, I kept wanting the terror to end, but I couldn't put the book down. I almost felt as if I were there too, suffering with them under the wrath of their wicked grandmother and the betrayal of their slowly-demoralizing mother. At the same time, the book was engrossing to a level I might never have seen before. I only wish V.C. could write with such electrifying power of a much more cheerful tale.
