 I just bought this doll a few hours ago and it's got its ups and downs: + Purple hair. 'Course that's just my opinion. I love purple hair. + Wings flash. Remind you of Jem's earings? - Lights require ultra-expensive watch batteries. + Batteries are included. + Wings are detachable and click back on magnetically. + Figure comes with a sneak peak DVD. - Sneak Peak DVD doesn't contain any real episodes. - Winx outfit is dam near impossible to take off. A nightmare to put back on. Don't even try to wear the clothes yourself. - Equipping helmet can mess-up the hair. - Casual top's neckline is hard to fasten ... at least on mine. +/- Internal "bendy" wires. Great for flexibility, but what if some of them snap? -/+ Too small to fit into Barbie or Skipper clothes. Could possibly fit into Stacy's or The Bratz'. - Braclet does not fit most adult wrists. Everything else you need to know about the doll, you can know by looking at the pictures.
