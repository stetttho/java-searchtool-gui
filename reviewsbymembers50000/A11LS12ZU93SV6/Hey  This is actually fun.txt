 Unlike most liscenced games, which would appeal more to fans than non-fans, this game is better suited for players that don't know or care who the Ninja Turtles are. Like "Fall of the Footclan," this title is a pretty straightforward kick-their-butts action video game. A = Jump, B = Attack, R is for a special move that depends on the situation, and I don't know what L does. If you demand spice in your dish, I'm afraid all you'll get is the mild, in the form of a sewer vehicle, a motorcycle, a hang glider, and a skateboard. What's the downside? Well, in my opinion, it would have been nice if April, Casey Jones, Splinter, and even Shredder were playable. Come to think of it, I don't think you even face Shredder. I also think the presence of Krang, Rocksteady, and Bebop would have been nice, but they're not in the newer cartoon series, so the only point would be to satisfy the nostalgia of older fans such as myself. Well, I can't blame you if you're wondering whether this is really a game review or just self pity, so I'll get to the point: if you like lots of fighting and a little platform action, you'll probably like this game.
