 Legend of Legaia is a relatively simple RPG with a new twist: now you can customize the way you attack your enemies. This makes it look sort of like a Tekken game, but it's still menu-based.  The story begins when Vagn, the main character with blue hair, is preparing to go hunting. Of course, like almost every RPG story that starts out with a plan, things take a turn for the worst: Vagn's girlfriend's father gets killed by monsters in THE MIST, then an evil entity invades Vagn's village. Now Vagn must go on an adventure to stop the mist permanently. The guy who was killed isn't especially important; Vagn is just sick of people dying. On his way, Vagn meets a young girl named Noa and an Akuma look-alike named Byron (if I remember the name correctly). Sorry to cut off there, but you'll have to play the game if you want to know more. It's worth it though. What I especially like about Legend of Legaia is that it fits into the 32-bit era without sacrificing bizarre hair colors. This is very essential to anime, as it can somehow relax the nerves.
