 This seems to be the highlight of Disney animation. The Little Mermaid never seems to get boring, while the others get dry (no pun intended). This animated movie spawned pretty much every type of merchendice: video games, dolls, books, panties, happy meals, ice cream, socks, etc., etc., etc. So why is this movie so good? It's not because of the subliminal message on the original cover. This is the kind of movie that puts everything together without burning the cake. The songs aren't bad either. Even if you hate Hakunamatata (or however you spell that stupid song) from The Lion King, Sebastian's Under The Sea actually has a nice rythm. Back on the subject, Ariel is the rebelious daughter of Tritan, the self-proclaimed king of the sea. Tritan becomes especially distraut when Ariel falls for a human fisherman, so Ariel seeks help from the Sea Witch, Ursula.
