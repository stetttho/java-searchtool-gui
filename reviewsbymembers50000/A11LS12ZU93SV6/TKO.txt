 Before he was convicted of sexual assault, before he beat his wife half to death, and before he bit Evander Hollyfield's ear, Mike Tyson signed a deal with Nintendo to make a video game that pits a wiery-looking teenager nick-named Little Mac against (in order of appearance) Glass Joe, Von Kaiser, Piston Honda, Don Flaminco, The Hippo King, Great Tiger, Bald Bull, Piston Honda again, Soda Popinski, Don Flaminco again, Bald Bull again, Mr. Sandman, Super Macho Man, then eventually Mike Tyson. The bad news: You're not Mike Tyson, you're Little Mac. Fortunately, you have a chubby coach in your corner with a never-say-die attitude and a shiny pink bike (who says gay people have no place in video games?). So while the game isn't 2-players and you can't fight as Mike Tyson, it's still one of the best boxing video games you'll ever play.
