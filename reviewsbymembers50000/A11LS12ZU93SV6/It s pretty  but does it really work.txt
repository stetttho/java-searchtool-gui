 What you see is what you get. The tiny D-Pad is slightly out of reach, you have to press the L and R buttons in until they click for most third party titles when not used for analog purposes. I think the two kidney buttons (I said kidney, not kiddy!!!!!!!) look and feel a little weird, and sometimes make Street Fighter style games with different attack levels (ex quick, medium, strong) a bit confusing. I wish Nintendo would make another style with the trigger buttons more like the X-Box and PS2. I also think a digital/analog switch would have been nice to solve that mandatory click problem in third party titles.
