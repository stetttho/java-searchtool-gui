 To answer a question that's probably never been asked but needs an answer anyway: Disco was in the 1960's and 1970's what Techno is today. That's the way it was when ABBA performed on a regular basis. Today, songs from their time are being revised by various bands of today. The A*Teens are one such band.  ABBA purists will probably dismiss this album as a sour rip-off to make a quick buck. Let them be jaded if they want, but personally I like this CD. It takes classic songs from ABBA and sort-of adjusts them to fit the styles of today.  So before you simply dismiss this CD as junk, borrow it from a local library (like I did) and give it a test run. Then make your judgement.
