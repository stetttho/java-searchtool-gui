 What's so legendary about being a helpless princess who keeps having to be rescued? Anyway -- seeing as how my first review of this game was little or no help at all, I'm going to try again. Once again, you play as a young adventurer named Link or whatever name you give him. You're out on a quest to find your little sister, Aryl, after she is abducted by a dragon/bird. The controls are almost identical to The Ocarina of Time: A=Action B=Attack X=Item 3 Y=Item 1 Z=Item 2 L=Strafe/Target R=Block C=Camera Control-Stick=Movement CrossPad=um...map, I think Those are the ground controls. The controls for your raft are similar. Being a self-proclaimed feminist, I have trouble with the sexism involved in the story: Link is only trained by the elders because he is male, the same gender as the "legendary hero" from the Ocarina of Time. If you're not stung by political falacies, this probably won't bother you as much as it does me. ...moving on... Wind Waker recieves only 3 stars because it's essentially a rehash of Ocarina of Time with new graphics and a slightly different story. I don't really see any point in owning this title unless you are a die-hard Zelda fan. If you're more into Zelda herself, try Super Smash Bros Melee or some of those CD-i video games.
