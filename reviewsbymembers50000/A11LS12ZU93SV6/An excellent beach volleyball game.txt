 Personally, I found this game good enough to buy -- 4 stars may not be maximum but it's no gas bomb either. However, I felt there could have been more: more stages, more options, and more teams. It's possible that SEGA is holding out for a sequil. Next time, I think the sound options should be put in three categories: music, sound FX, AND announcer (he's so annoying). A female announcer would have been better too. That being said, SEGA did a tremendous job in applying the physics and making a simple yet effective control scheme. Additionally there a circles indicating where the ball will land, so you don't have to rely on shadows or blind luck like previous volleyball games such as the unofficial Venice Beach game for the NES back in the days of 8 bits. Actually it wasn't so bad, but that's besides the point. Even as a hater of sports games, I highly recommend this game to anyone (female or male) who likes intense, hard-hitting action four-player action with with an all-female cast. Some women may be offended by the skimpiness of the uniforms, but that's a small price to pay. Finally there is a women's sports game that does the gender justice. Note: This is an ARCADE-style video game, not just because it debuted in the arcades, but because it's very "basic" like most arcade games are. I don't know personally, I've been told though, that there are many more rules to real volleyball than in this particular game.
