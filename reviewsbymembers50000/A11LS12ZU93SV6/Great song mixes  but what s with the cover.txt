 I only heard the full version of the Axel Konrad Remix when I downloaded it from . . . one of those places that let you buy songs. I read the rule book: Amazon.com does not like it when a reviewer brings up another source [cussing under my breath].  The song has a great rythm too it, sort of like NovaSpace, even if it does drag on a little too long. It also does not have a variety in lyrics, as less than 50% of dance songs do.  This is more of a rhetorical question than a complaint, but what's with the cover? It's seductive, though I can guess there are a few females who might be offended, but it doesn't really seem to fit with the music. Maybe I'm just one of those people who think a song about God and a picture of someone (a female, I hope) with a hand part way in her panties don't fit together. Then again, I did some image searches for more CD covers on Groove Coverage and found more lingerie-esque pictures. I guess they have thing for feminin underwear, or it's just using sex to sell. Anyway, I have dwelled on this issue long enough and you probably stopped reading this review a long time ago so I'll just stop.
