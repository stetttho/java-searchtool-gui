 This game is about a princess out to rescue the two guys who usually rescue her. Various gaming magazines say this game should hold fans over until "the real deal, New Super Mario Bros." comes out. I'm not waiting for that game, I'm doing fine with just this one. Enough rammbling though.  Super Princess Peach essentially plays like a standard side-scrolling Super Mario video game, except that you don't use fire flowers, leaves, or various animal suits to power up. Instead, you rely on raw emotion, which you can activate by touching the screen. You can also buy new special effects for your umbrella as well.  Not a very effective review, I know. This is my second draft.  The game is rumble-pak compatible. I got mine with Metroid Pinball, but you can get one by itself from Nintendo's official website.  The gameplay is solid, but the control set-up is not perfect. A for jump and B for attack would be a good thing if this were a Game Boy game, but the buttons are laid out differently on the DS as I explained in my DS/Mario Kart bundle review. A for Jump. B or Y for Attack. X for picking stuff up. Then press down to have the umbrellas go Kirby and swollow your eneimes to refil your Vibe powers bar. Holding L or R allows you to move slower. This is good for walking across unsteady bridges and blocks.  12 out of 17 people found my initial review helpful. A shame I had to reset that number by rewriting my review but a few differences have come up. I had previously said that Tomb Raider Legend was not announced for any Nintendo console. That has changed.
