 WOW!!! It's Wolverine in his very own video game!! Let's all celebrate!! Let's throw a ^*&%ing party!! Seriously though, even if the controls weren't disgusting, the mere fact that it has one of the world's most over-rated comic book super heroes would destroy it... for me, anyway. Some people actually worship this guy. You can probably find some geek with a shrine and a poster that says, "Wolverine, our savior, is better than God!". Wolverine used to be my favorite until over-exposure such as this ruined him. Now I'm rooting for Storm, who is infinitely (times 2,000,000) better than Wolverine will ever be. What about the game, though? I'd give you one if I could, but I wasn't able to play the game long enough without getting bored out of my mind.
