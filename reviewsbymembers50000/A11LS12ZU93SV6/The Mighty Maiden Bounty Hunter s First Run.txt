 Although the first in a popular series, this isn't the best and is incomparable to Super Metroid. Granted the game is big, which means there is lots of exploring, there is one set of closely related problems that make Metroid less than steller, all related to attacking: Samus curls (or does nothing if you don't have the ball) when you press down so she cannot duck and shoot, disabling her from attacking small anemies on the ground until she has the ball-bomb or wave beam much later in the game. Additionally, Samus cannot shoot diagnally in any direction and she cannot shoot downwards. In my review of Super Mario 64, I said that one shouldn't only complain about what a game does NOT have; however, these features would be practically essential to the game. Buy only if you are a hardcore Metroid fan or you really want to play the game that started it all. Otherwise, look somewhere else.
