 Let's see: The DVD contains the first six episodes, and I got it for about... so that's about a dollar a show. Not bad, really. This is your basic set of family manga entertainment, with two sexy schoolgirls and a mad queen from the Negaverse. Queen Beryl wants to steal energy to feed the negaverse, but she's too lazy to do it herself so she sends some guy named Jedite (did I spell that right?) to do her dirty work. Of course, Jedite, clever as his ideas are, keeps failing thanks to the sailor scouts. My only gripes about this disk are that the transformations and phrases almost never change, Sailor Moon is a bad role-model because she's too scared, and Sailor Mars doesn't appear until the next DVD.
