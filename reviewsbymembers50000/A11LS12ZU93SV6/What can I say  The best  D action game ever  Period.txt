 I could knock a few stars off by going on and on about what they SHOULD have put into this game -a playable Princess, animal costumes, Fire Flowers, etc.- but such negativity could foolishly ruin such a great game. Super Mario 64 isn't perfect but it has the best damn gameplay of any action title. The worlds are massive with lots of vibrant colors, whacky enemies, catchy music, and most importantly, gameplay.  The only downsides to this game are Mario's voice, an occasionally fussy camera, and the possibility of graining your N64 control stick when you fight Bowser. These minor neusances are mild though and they don't really hinder the gameplay. All other downsides merely point to the characters themselves: Mario speaks with a bad Italian accent voiced by Charles Martinet instead of his old Brooklyn one from the cartoon series. I also don't like the changes made to Princess Toadstool. Instead of the spunky redhead from the cartoon series, she seems more like a "dumb blonde" with a weird voice. Yes, this game is old but, like fine wine, games can get better with age.
