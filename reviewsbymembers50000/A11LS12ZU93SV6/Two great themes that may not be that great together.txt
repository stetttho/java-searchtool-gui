 Have you ever wondered if Samus' morph-ball form would give developers some crazy idea? I think this should answer your question unless what you wanted to know was ... never mind. It's not appropriate for this website.  Sure, I like pinball, and yes, I like at least two of the Metroid games: Super Metroid and Metroid ZERO Misson. I also like red salsa and ice cream, but I wouldn't pour salsa over my ice cream. Do you see what I'm getting at?  Granted, this game is fun. Why else would I give it four stars? It's got the look and feel of a pinball game, it rumbles with the black GBA-looking cart that comes with it, and you can even tilt the table by touching the screen.  One of the main problems I have with this game is a problem that cannot be helped. Well, it could be helped, but it would reduce the realism of a pinball board. Since Nintendo wanted a long board without having to scroll, the top screen shows the upper half of the board, while the bottom screen shows the lower half. That leaves a small invisible space between the two screens that is there but is never seen. It's not a big problem, but it can sometimes leave you with blind spots when you're trying to aim in shoot mode. There is another problem with the game that also can't be helped unless you have big hands. Otherwise, learn the value of your pinky fingers for now is when you need them the most. They'll support the bottom of the DS while your index fingers press the shoulder buttons. Or you could just press two of the face buttons, but what fun is that?  This review isn't over. I'll update it when I come back later, look at this review in disgust, and revise.
