 My dad bought this book for me for my birthday without looking inside first. When he eventually looked through it, he was disappointed; I wasn't. This book is not about fighting the usual comic book villains, this is more about facing the real-life situation of world hunger. I don't want to spoil it for you, but Superman learns that even with all his super powers, he can't do everything. There were parts of this book that almost made me cry. I highly recomend this book to anyone who likes Superman but wouldn't mind seeing a little less of the Lex Luthor stuff. Although I didn't give this book 5 stars, I still think it's a great book. The illustrations, while not my favorite, are nicely done. ...now if I could just find my copy. Must have lost it somewhere in one of my many moves...
