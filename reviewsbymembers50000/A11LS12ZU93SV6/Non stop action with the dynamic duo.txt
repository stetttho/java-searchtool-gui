 If you think a super hero game can never be too fast-pased, this could change your mind. Enemies come at you from every corner throughout the entire game, constantly trying to take you under. You'd swear you were in Detroit. If you want a slower-paced game based on the animated series, try the SNES version. It doesn't let you play as Robin, but it has more depth and . . . wait a minute!! I'm not reviewing the SNES version!!! As either Batman or Robin, you throw various weapons at your enemies as you keep scrolling to the right and trying not to get killed.
