 In Final Fight 1, newly elected Mayor Mike Hagger took on the streets of Metro City. Now he's out to take on the world. Metro City's favorite wrestler-turned-mayor is back to save Guy's fiance and future fahter-in-law with the help of Guy's future sister-in-law Maki, and Carlos, an ex-con whom Hagger somehow helped out. Oddly enough, Guy makes no appearence except for a power-up figurine and a picture in the intro. Now there is a two-player mode and two new characters on the scene. The Graphics are slightly better in some ways than SNES's first Final Fight, the music is a bit of a let-down, and Maki looks drop-dead gorgeous. That's about the gist of it. Finally, let me just go on record: in case you have been wondering if anything was taken out of the U.S. version of Final Fight 2, the answer is yes.
