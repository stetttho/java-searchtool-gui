 Before I get started, let me put a guideline for how I use the stars. 5 means it's great or perfect, 4 means it's good but could be better, 3 means it has potential that it doesn't use but it's still a decent game, 2 means the game does nothing for me, and 1 means I hate the game with a passion. That being said, let's get started. I never played the Sega CD or Game Gear versions of the game, so I can't judge those. I think the Super NES version is the best one I've played. It has nice tunes, fairly good Final-Fight(or Double Dragon)-style gameplay, tight controls, and the graphics aren't bad either. The game could have benefited from extras such as a playable Catwoman, but I'm not going further down that road in this review. Unlike most of the other Batman games, this one actually contains music from its movie counterpart. I don't know if it's digital or midi, but it sounds good.
