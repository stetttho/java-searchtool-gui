 Go ahead! Make all the silly sex jokes you can come up with, 'cause when your daddy's in the hospital after getting the living daylights beaten out of him by a rivial gang, you'll be glad you're wearing a sexy tutu with fire-engine-red pumps... er, I mean, you'll be glad you have a compact car with legs and an over-sized drill!  As it says on the box, the cartrige vibrates. What the box doesn't tell you is that you can also play the game on the Game Boy Player and make your GameCube controller rumble. For even more fun, plug a rumble-enabled controller (not a Hori or WaveBird) into port 1 of your GameCube, play the game using any GC-compatible controller plugged into port 2, and the put port 1's controller on your lap.  The L & R buttons power the drill to turn it left or right. Not as in stearing your vehicle clockwise or counter-clockwise, but like a drill going in forward or reverse. Most of the time it doesn't matter which way the drill is spinning unless you're trying to open a door, drilling screws, jumping backwards, or fighting a boss that requires certain patterns of attack.  The A button is for jumping (or sliding if DOWN is held on the cross pad). The B button is for scouting and reading signs. I wish it was for attacking, but it's not. Jill does look cute when she pops up like a curious puppy from a box. The Start button pasues the game and the Select button brings up the menu. The controls are a little frustrating at first, but you should adapt quickly.  *Yes, the intro is based on an ad I saw from Keio Flying Squadron for Sega CD! Happy now?!!
