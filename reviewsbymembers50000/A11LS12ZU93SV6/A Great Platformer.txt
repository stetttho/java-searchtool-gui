 This kind of platformer fits into the "jump and stomp" category derived from such old-school video games as Super Mario Bros., Back to the Future 2&3 (one gamepak), and Aladdin for SNES. This means you defeat your enemies by jumping onto them.  Even though I gave the game five stars, it's still not perfect. Unless you really love a challenge, Snow White in Happily Ever After can get frustrating at times with all the ledges. However, you might not find this game difficult at all, and I personally seems to get frustrated at games too often. In short, the gameplay is ultra-fun, the music is catchy, and the graphics are very vibrant. If you like bright colors or fantasy-based games without all the RPG-complications, give this game a try. You'll be glad you did. Note: As another reviewer said, this is NOT a Nintendo 64 video game and is not recommended without a Super Nintendo or a Tri-Star adapter for the N64
