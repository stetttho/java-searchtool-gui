 Final Fight 3 is actually the fifth game in the series that made side-scrolling beat-the-hell-out-of-em genre so popular in the very late eighties and early nineties: Final Fight Revenge was released on the Sega Saturn in Japan and Mighty Final Fight was released on the 8-Bit Nintendo Entertainment System in the NES's final years.  This video game features four different street-fighting heroes: Mike Hagger the pro-wrestler gone mayor (remind you of a certain Minnesotan governer?); Guy, the fist-throwing karate expert from Japan; Lucia, the "Angel Eyes" detective; and Dean, the electricity-enhanced brawler. This is the kind of game you and a friend should play when you just want to knock bad guys senseless without having to worry about consequences. To ad replay value, you can take different routes in certain parts of the game.
