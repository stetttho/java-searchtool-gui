 I know I'm not supposed to make references to other reviews but I can't help noticing that at least two 12-year-old gamers think this game is horriible. Perhapse pre-teens are so in touch with 3D games that 2D games seem brittle, or maybe it's about taste. In any case, I personally recommend Mischief Makers to any gamer who can tolerate mostly-two-dimensional side-scrollers. Not only does it have a female hero (okay so she's really a robot), it's also lots of fun with few complications. There is so much mindless humor, you might go boom. "Okay, whatever!" you ask? Right. Did I mention no struggling with camera angles? That's right: no clipping, no awkward views, and no blocky characters.  The main character, one Ms. Sarina Lightyears, calls herself an Intergalactic Cybot G! Her creator, one Professor... oh, what's his name?! Anyway, Marina's father/creator has been kidnapped and now she must rescue him from his evil brother and a gang of so-called do-gooders. I don't see any reason not to play this game unless you hate girls or side-scrollers. Give it a girl... I mean whirl! You'll be glad you did! I'd say more but I'm a bit tired. Expect an updated review soon.
