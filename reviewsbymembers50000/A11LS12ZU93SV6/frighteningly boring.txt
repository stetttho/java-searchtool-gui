 Owning this video myself, I want to say that this is an excellent title, but then I'd only be saying that to make myself feel better. While it's not the worst cartoon I've ever seen, it is the worst episode in my opinion. Of course, this could just be that I don't like the "Ride of the Valkyries" song. I like valkyries, just not the song. Anyway, rent it if you can before considering purchase.
