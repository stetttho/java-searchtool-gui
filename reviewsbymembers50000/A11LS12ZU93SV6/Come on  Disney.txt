 I'm not going to tell you how I played this game. I will tell you this though: this title seriously lacks any solidity. It's basically a monotonous series of little games that are more chores than fun. As Cinderella, you clean spots all over the house and nothing more, and I can't even remember what Belle, Snow White, and Aurora do. Ariel swims around and is ever-so-vaguely remeniscent of The Little Mermaid for NES -- which is still a great game, by the way. DP is not a total loss though, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. It has it's moments: Princess Jasmin provides minor thrills on her magic carpet. But Disney could do so much better. There are no girl-gamers and boy-gamers! There are only gamers and non-gamers! You don't need sludge like this to entertain a little girl.
