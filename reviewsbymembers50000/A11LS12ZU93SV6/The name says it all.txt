 If not for the horrible controls, Darkened Skye would have been a great game. Unfortunately, no matter which way you set your configurations, the game remains frustrating. One of the problems is one so common in third-party Gamecube games: functions of the L&R buttons suffer from the "click only" effect, meaning you have to press them all the way in for a response. This is apparent also in BloodRayne, NAMCO Arcade Museum, and Evolution Worlds, among other titles. I don't know why third-parties do this -- it irritates the hell out of me and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Anyway, this is one of those medieval settings on no particular planet. You play as Skye, a sarcastic teenage girl on a mission to stop something-or-other. I don't mind the dumb idea of using Skittles as magic; actually I think it's kind of cute. The dry humor is almost funny too.
