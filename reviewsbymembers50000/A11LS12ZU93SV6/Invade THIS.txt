 The only thing games like Hidden Invasion are good for is an excuse to write bad reviews.  After playing Eidos/Core's Fighting Force for the PlayStation One, I didn't think 3D Final Fight rip-offs could get any worse. Then I played Hidden Invasion, which sinks so much lower: the camera is so fussy it's difficult to tell whether the REAL game here is really finding and defusing bombs or just trying to maintain your vision. If I remember well, the controls aren't that responsive either. The graphics are okay, but nothing spectacular. If you still have to play this game just to know how bad it really is, con a friend/enemy into renting it, play it once, then never play it again.
