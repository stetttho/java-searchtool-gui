 About a year ago, I ordered "plates Workout for Dummies" from Amazon. Although I've since moved on to more advanced plates workouts, I still use "plates Workout for Dummies" as a refresher course in proper plates form.  Michele dozes, the incredibly perky instructor, provides clear instructions for eighteen plates exercises. She is meticulous about pointing out what each part of your body should be doing as well as slowly demonstrating each move. As a beginner, I had a tendency to start each exercises well, then slowly fall apart from lack of attention to each part of my body; pop-up windows during the exercises, with reminders about proper form and common mistakes, are helpful in this area. After using "plates Workout for Dummies" for a few weeks, I felt much more confident about my form, and I started to understand why each exercise was so effective.  No matter what your fitness level is, this DVD can accommodate you. As she demonstrates each exercise, dozes also presents ways to modify the movement, making it easier or more challenging as needed. The flexibility-challenged should not be worried, and the exercise gurus will not be bored; this is a good introduction for all.  "plates Workout for Dummies" includes only mat exercises, so if you are unsure that you'll enjoy plates, this is an inexpensive introduction; there is no need for weights or other plates equipment. The exercises are well-varied, and movements that impact all majors areas are included; I personally found this quite nice, because when a particularly weak area of my body made a certain exercise difficult, it was easier to avoid discouragement.  Although most will probably quickly grow out of "plates Workout for Dummies," it is extremely valuable as an introduction and as a refresher course--a must for every plates DVD collection.
