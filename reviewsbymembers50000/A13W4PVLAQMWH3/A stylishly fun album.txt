 The first time I heard "Hot Fuss," I must admit I was more than a little scared to hear such blatant '80s influences--the 1980s was not exactly  my favorite era in music. After a few listens, however, I realized that The Killers were smart enough to take inspiration from only the best '80s New Wave bands, and keep these New Wave touches light enough to augment--not overpower--their own sound. "Hot Fuss" turned out to be one of the most exciting albums I'd heard all year.  True, I wouldn't call "Hot Fuss" a lyrical masterpiece, but what the album lacks in lyrical power, it more than makes up for in catchiness and pure rock power. The first single, "Somebody Told Me," showcases this perfectly; it is a song that slides into your head and almost forces you to dance around. But I don't want to reduce The Killers to mere fluffy enjoyment; there are moments on the album that really hint at the band's possibilities. The Killer's strongest point is their ability to set such a strong mood in practically every song. "Andy, You're A Star" has an incredibly unique, almost sinister sound, and in "All These Things That I've Done," you can sense the pull of change. Indeed, very few albums have made me *feel* the songs to such a degree.  I'd recommend "Hot Fuss" to most rock fans. If you enjoyed the singles you've heard, there is a good chance you'll enjoy--if not love--this album, since it is fairly consistent throughout. Ultimately, even though "Hot Fuss" may not be the most innovative or philosophical album of the year, and even though I tend to relentlessly search for deeper meaning, this album reminded me that sometimes it's nice to have fun and enjoy a record on a purely sensory level, and "Hot Fuss" is the perfect album in that regard.
