 Chanel's Aqualumiere lipstick is, in my opinion, the best lipstick formula on the market. The lipstick goes on as shiny as lipgloss but has the texture of lip balm. The colors, though sheer, still have good pigmentation; the sheerness is actually a benefit because it allows the lipstick color to blend well with your natural lip color, lessening the chance that your lip color will come out looking unnatural. The Aqualumiere line of lipsticks do need to be reapplied more often than a less sheer lipstick, but the lasting power is still relatively high, and reapplication is less of a bother because of the lipstick's texture.  Though I have not tried all the colors, the pinks in this formula--Waikiki in particular--strike me as especially natural and face-brightening.
