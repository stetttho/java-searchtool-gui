 "The Economist" is by far the best news magazine today, both for the information it provides and for the way it presents that information.  "The Economist" is able to provide startlingly in-depth and rigorous reports on both American and global news, and perhaps best of all, it avoids showing a bias or privileging any side. This is not to say that the magazine does not provide critical assessments of important issues; the commentary pieces are particularly thought-provoking and well-argued. However, the magazine manages to be critical of all sides equally, allowing for balanced yet engaging news reports.  Although this magazine is quite dense--there are few ads, and no filler articles--reading "The Economist" never becomes tedious. All reports utilize good economy of language, allowing the reader to quickly get to the heart of the issue. Even so, the writing is still extremely enjoyable and well-written. I keeping returning to "The Economist" not merely for the wealth of information it provides, but for the fact that reading it is actually pleasurable.  Ultimately, though the price of a year's subscription is not cheap, a subscription to "The Economist" is worth every penny--particularly since you won't have to spend money any other news magazine.
