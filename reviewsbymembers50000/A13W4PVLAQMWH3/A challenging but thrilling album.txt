 Wilco's fifth album is both their best and their most challenging. The first listen is deceiving; like several other reviewers, after my first listen I felt somewhat deflated. I enjoyed the album, but it didn't seem to fulfill the promise of "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot." Thankfully, I gave "A Ghost Is Born" another try.  The delicacy and subtlety of this album cannot be overstated, and only after several listens can these qualities truly be appreciated. What begins to emerge is an album that is not merely a collection of songs, but a single entity, tied together strongly by common themes and motifs. The title of the album, "A Ghost Is Born," becomes a surprisingly clear sign post. The idea of becoming a ghost--a translucent and seemingly unclear, yet poignent and somehow more honest, version of oneself--echoes throughout the album. This idea is addressed lyrically, most obviously in "Theologians," "Hummingbird," and "Company in My Back." It is also conveyed in the music itself. Over and over again, the band builds to a cresendo of sound, continuing to grow long after your heart feels it must break; when the wave finally does break, you feel as though it has split you apart, and only your essence of being remains, stripped bare. Death and rebirth--and the beauty and heart-wrenching nature of such processes--can ultimately be heard in every song.  This album certainly requires effort. Every note and every word on this album is purposeful and absolutely necessary, but can be easily disregarded. Wilco did not make "A Ghost Is Born" an easy album, but it can become one of the most thrilling and emotional experiences you will ever hear.
