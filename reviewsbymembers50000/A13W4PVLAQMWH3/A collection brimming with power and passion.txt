 I freely admit that I know very little about poetry; my bookshelves contain many, many novels and only a handful of poetry collections. Indeed, my desire to read "Ariel" sprang out of my deep love of "The Bell Jar." In the end, however, I fell in love with this collection of poems not because they were by the same author as "The Bell Jar," but because in each short poem Plath is able to bring as much emotion and life into the world as she does in the entirety of her novel.  Although I think it is important to take the collection as a whole--in the order that Plath intended--several poems stand out to me. "Fever 103" captures the restlessness and the delirious passion caused by the flu with amazing acuteness; this poem is one of many instances where Plath notes moments and feelings that generally pass unnoticed and brings out their weight and urgency. "The Applicant" demonstrates the bitter realizations caused by a dissolving relationship, and Plath reveals the feelings caused by an inability to fit with the world. And one particular image from "Elm" haunts me:  "I am inhabited by a cry. Nightly it flaps out Looking, with its hooks, for something to love."  As I said, I am no poetry expert, so I have difficulty judging exactly how good Plath's poems are as poems. In terms of what they presented me and what I took from them, however, the poems in this collection resonate with me more than most novels do. Plath gives these pure moments and sharp emotions such fullness and life, and their brevity and lyricism only highlight this fact.
