 "One Hundred Years Of Solitude" can be a daunting book. At almost 500 pages, the book covers six generations of the Buenda family--a fact which is even more daunting when you consider that Garca Mrquez uses the repetition of names within the family as a thematic device. The events of the book all have a mystical overtone, and magic and reality frequently collide.   Once you begin to read "One Hundred Years of Solitude," those facts which make the book at first seem daunting actually give the book its attraction. The grandiose scale of the story of one family and the apparently uncertain and magical reality in which they live make the book seem like a fairy tale told over a campfire, whose origins have long been forgotten. Even though Garca Mrquez has a very distinctive style of writing, he falls far into the background in "One Hundred Years of Solitude;" it is as though the story is telling itself.  The book follows the Buendia family from their founding of the village of Macondo until the last days of both the family and the village. Time--as with everything else--is not straightforward, however; past, present, and future all seem to mix, confusing the reality of the setting. Garca Mrquez further confuses this by including information and stories which are too fantastical to be believed alongside a seemingly realistic and straightforward narrative, and refusing to distinguish between the two. The result of these devices is not to undermine the reality of this world, but to actually give this world the sense of ultimate reality and our own world the sense of fiction.  "One Hundred Years of Solitude" is my favorite book, and one of the very few that intrigues and beguiles me more after every reread. It is not an easy book to start, but within a few pages, you will be drawn in Garca Mrquez's world and will not want to leave.
