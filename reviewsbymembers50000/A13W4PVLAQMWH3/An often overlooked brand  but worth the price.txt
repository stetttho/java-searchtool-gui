 Although Paul & Joe's line of makeup is not widely popular--or widely available--their lipsticks are particularly nice, and well worth the effort to track down. Also these lipsticks feel more like lip balm, the colors are very well-pigmented. Indeed, I find Paul & Joe's lipstick to be on the opaque end of the scale, in terms of opaque versus sheer. The lasting power is quite impressive.  And, although it may be a relatively minor detail, Paul & Joe's packaging has a great retro feel to it, and is stylish enough to be pulled out of your purse shamelessly.
