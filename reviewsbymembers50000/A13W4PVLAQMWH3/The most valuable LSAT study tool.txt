 This packet is the newest of three such packets released by LSAC, and is invaluable to anyone studying for the LSAT. I highly recommend avoiding at all costs any practice test that is not real LSAT released by LSAC; the practice tests manufactured by Kaplan, Barron's, Princeton Review and the like tend to be over-simplified, and often have little in common with the actual LSAT.  Although I recommend taking as many practice LSATs as humanly possible in preparation for the real thing, if you are short on time, get this packet instead of the previous two. The test has changed a lot over the years, and in most instances, has become more difficult; I find scoring 178 on a test from the mid-nineties to be less challenging than scoring a 170 on a test from last year.  It is true that this packet simply contains past LSATs with their answer keys, and no explanation for why the right answer is the right answer. Unless you feel as extremely unfamiliar with the types of questions on the LSAT, however, that there are no explanations is probably a plus: figuring out why your answer to a question was wrong is actually more valuable than simply getting the question right. Having another book handy which explains the test and question types--I recommend Kaplan's--is extremely beneficial, though. And good luck to all future LSAT takers!
