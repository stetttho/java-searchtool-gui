   This is a truly accurate and unbiased account of the dark and bloody history of the Ohio River Valley during the Revolutionary War.  Hintzen makes it very clear that there were atrocities committed by both sides in this conflict and sums it up by saying that it was a war of extermination.  Had the Native Americans and their British backers succeeded in exterminating the colonial frontiersman trying to eke out an existence in Kentucky and western Virginia, history would have been different.       Hintzen clears up alot of myths regarding Lewis Wetzel which make him appear to be a psychopathic, bloodthirsty monster.  While Wetzel may have hated his adversaries, he was no worse than many of his Native American counterparts.    Hintzen neither romanticizes the frontiersmen the way many nineteenth century historians have done nor does he try to be politically "correct".  Hintzen tells it like it really was.  Frontier life was a harsh life for survival.  The bitter conflict between the frontiersmen and Native Americans was a fight for survival, nothing more, nothing less.
