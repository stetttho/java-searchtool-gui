 This book is for the serious seeker who wants something more than pop culture Christianity being peddled by celebrity evangelists. DeMar does an effective job in debunking false interpretations of Revelation which seem so popular but can be so misleading.  By putting Revelation in its proper historical perspective, he makes it far more believable.  Revelation was meant to be understood.  Unfortunately, many modern evangelists have complicated  it in order to sell books and videos. I also recommend "The Beast of Revelation" by Kenneth Gentry and Margaret Barker's "Revelation" book. The bottom line is - if John wrote about things that were to happen some 2,000 years in the future, he was either greatly deceiving the people he was writing to or was greatly deceived himself. DeMar makes it very clear that Revelation describes events that actually did happen making it a truly inspired book.  Unfortunately, some modern evangelists have turned it into a mystery which only they can solve. They are the false prophets.
