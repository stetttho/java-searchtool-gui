 I began reading this book out of curiousity but quit about halfway through.  The absolutely bogus research that went in to this book was more than I could stomach.    The back cover hype, ie "...rocked the foundations of Christianity" and "...earth shaking consequences" should've been a clue that this would be the same tired old Christian-bashing nonsense which has so much appeal for new-agers and atheists who refuse to accept Chrisianity for what it is.    Here are only a few examples from the book:    Paul started a new pagan cult with Jesus as God.  Please show me in the New Testament where Paul proclaimed Jesus was God!    (p.96) Most Biblical scholars concur that the churches that developed in Syria, Asia Minor, and Egypt were not diluted by Pauline thought as in Rome.      Fact:  The Syrian Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East, and Coptic Egyptian churches, although not influenced by Rome, are very orthodox in their beliefs, use and revere the very same Bible but only in their native language, ie Coptic, Arabic, or Assyrian/Aramaic, revere the Apostle Paul and read his epistles in their liturgies.  Have these "Biblical scholars" ever researched these churches or sat in on one of their liturgies?  Do they even exist?    (p.103)  Simeon bar Kochba was angry with Jewish Christians for foresaking their Zealot roots and becoming pro Roman pacifistic "Pauline" Christians.     Fact:  Simeon bar Kochba was a fanatical self-proclaimed messiah who murdered Jewish Christians for remaining faithful to Jesus and not accepting bar Kochba as the messiah.    (pp.107-108) Nazarean thought survived in the heresy known as Nestorian Christianity.    Fact: So called "Nestorian" Christianity refers to the Assyrian Church of the East which prior to the 5th century was part of the Syrian Orthodox Church.  As such, they revere the Nicene Creed which they recite in their liturgy, use and revere the same Bible we do only in their language, and revere the Epistles of Paul and read them in their liturgy.   Egyptian monastic communities perpetuated "Nazarean" thought.   Fact: Anybody who has ever read the Sayings or Lives of the Desert Fathers would know that the Egyptian hermits were ultra-orthodox in their beliefs, read and often memorized the same Bible, especially the Pauline Epistles, and abhorred Gnostic dualism.   The book claims that the Jewish Christians used the Gospel of Thomas which predates the canonical Gospels.   Fact:  The Gospel of Thomas was written in the second century and used by Gnostic Christians who tried to add pagan myths to Chrisitanity and went so far as to deny Jesus' humanity.    These are only a few examples of the absurdities presented in this book.         The book makes references to the fictional "Passover Plot" by Hugh Schonfield and the research of Robert Eisenman, a sensational Christian basher (see my review on James the Brother of Jesus).    I'm not a fundamentalist Bible thumper but a serious seeker.  I regret that I've wasted too much time reading this kind of junk.  If you want to understand Jesus and early Christianity, stick with your family Bible.
