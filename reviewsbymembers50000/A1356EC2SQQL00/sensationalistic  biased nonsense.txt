 If the Apostle Paul was the enemy of James and the Jerusalem community, as this book asserts, why would he encourage his converts to collect tithes for "the Saints in Jerusalem"?  Why would he submit to James' authority on a number of decisions and why would the New Testament even mention this?    Paul died over 200 years before Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire.  There was no way he could know that he would be cannonized as a saint hundreds of years later.  Paul spent his last days in Roman chains and was executed by Rome.  Eusebius and Clement both attest to this.  He was hardly an agent of Rome as this book suggests.    The author is clearly a man with an agenda; to tear down something he doesn't like which is Christianity.  The New Testament was written long before Christianity was "Romanized".  The only way to understand it is to accept it for what it is instead of trying to rewrite it according to your own prejudices.
