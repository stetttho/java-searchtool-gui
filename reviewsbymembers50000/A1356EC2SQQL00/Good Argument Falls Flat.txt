   I started reading this book out of curiosity.  The author actually makes a good argument in the beginning of the book.  The earliest Christian writings of Paul, James, Peter, and the Epistles of John make very little or no refernce to the historical Jesus but refer to him as if he were a Heavenly figure who lived in the distant past and appeared to the apostles in visions.  In addition, Paul writes to his various communities, ie Romans, as if they were already firmly established several years prior.     These theories were somewhat intriguing so I read further.  When the author made the claim that the gospels were written in the second century and borrowed the words of the second century apostolic fathers, particularly Ignatius of Antioch, I quit reading.  This is basically putting the cart in front of the horse.  The idea that the gospels quoted the apostolic fathers instead of the apostolic fathers quoting from the gospels is too absurd for any intelligent person to believe.  The idea that the apostolic fathers staked their lives on something they made up is ridiculous.     The apostles weren't interesed in writing biographies of Jesus.  They wanted people to convert to the faith of Jesus.  You can't get people interested in joining a movement by writing a historical sketch of someone's life which has no relevance to their present or future situation.
