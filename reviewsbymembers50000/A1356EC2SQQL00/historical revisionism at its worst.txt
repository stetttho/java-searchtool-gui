   The idea that Jesus was merely a beatnick philosopher or "cynic sage" who never had any messianic pretensions has been proven wrong both logically and historically.     Beatnick philosohers didn't get nailed to Roman crosses.    If Jesus didn't believe he was the Lord I hardly think all those first and second century Christian martyrs would have staked their lives on it.     The Enochian writings and the Dead Sea Scrolls, particularly the Thanksgiving Hymns, demonstrate that there were Jews who believed that an extraordinary human could become the incarnation of Yahweh or the Son of God and ascend to the right hand of the Almighty God.  If it's not impossible to believe the Teacher of Righteousness could believe this about himself, certainly Jesus could have.    The author clearly has an agenda; to transform Jesus into something he would like him to be, a harmless flower child.  If that's the case, I hardly think the High Priest or Pontius Pilate would've worried too much about him.  How do you explain the radical response of so many who called themselves his followers?    This is historical revisionism at its worst.
