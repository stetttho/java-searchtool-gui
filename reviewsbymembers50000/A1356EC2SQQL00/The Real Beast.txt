 This book puts to shame all the end-times hype being peddled by celebrity evangelists.  I never read any of the "Left Behind" books and don't intend to.  The movie was bad enough. Gentry has convinced me beyond a doubt that John wrote down his Revelation prior to the destruction of Jerusdalem in 70AD and that the "Beast" could be none other than Nero.  This book should be put on bookshelves in front of "The Left Behind" books.  This is for the serious seeker who wants something beyond pop culture evangelism.   I also recommend "End Times Fiction" by Gary DeMar and Margaret Barker's "Revelation" book. The bottom line is - if John wrote about things which were to occur some 2,000 years later, he was either greatly deceiving the people he was writing to or was greatly deceived himself.
