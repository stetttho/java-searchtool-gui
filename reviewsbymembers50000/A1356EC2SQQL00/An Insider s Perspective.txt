 Thibodeau does a good job in humanizing the individual members of the community.  He takes us right inside the compound and introduces us to real flesh and blood people who we can identify with.  He also enables us to understand the nightmare they had to go through.    Reading between the lines, Thibodeau and the other followers of Koresh were not people who could stand on their own feet and think for themselves.  Koresh provided the inspiration and vision that alot of these people needed to give their lives meaning.  The tragedy was, they were partly responsible for their own demise by allowing a pervert and egomaniac to lead them into such a hellish situation.  Anybody who was truly strong in their own moral convictions would be able to see Koresh for what he was.  These people were not.    Thibodeau admits to being uncomfortable with Koresh siring children through underage girls but seemingly turned a blind eye towards it.  This says alot about him and the followers of David Koresh.     This is a one-sided account, but a side which can't be totally ignored.
