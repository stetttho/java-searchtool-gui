 I find it difficult to believe that the Vatican would give a student access to secret archives that no other scholar has ever heard of.  But that's how the author claimed he came across this secret gospel.   This is a hodge-podge of quotes from the Gospels and from the Dead Sea Scrolls with some of the author's new-age beliefs thrown in.  Ancient Palestinian Jews did not personify nature the way this does.  This is clearly new-age fiction and it is ..... to pass it off as anything else.
