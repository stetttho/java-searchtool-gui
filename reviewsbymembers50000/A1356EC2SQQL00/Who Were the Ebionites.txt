 Why this book is not currently in print is a mystery to me.  I found this at a college library and was so impressed I made a copy for myself.    The identity of the Jewish Ebionite sect is made very clear in this book.  The Ebionites descended from the more radical "Hellenistic" element of the Jerusalem community who were driven out of Jerusalem, in large part due to Saul of Tarsus, due to their anti-Temple stance.  This explains their antipathy toward the Apostle Paul.  Their attitudes were reflected in the second century Pseudo-Clementine writings which disparage Paul and the Temple sacrificial system.  A good companion to this book is Schoeps' "Jewish Christianity".      So many people have tried to equate the Ebionites with the original Jerusalem community headed by James and therefore brand Paul as the enemy of that community.  This book clears up that false notion.  The Ebionites were considered arch-heretics by Jews and orthodox Christians because of their radical rejection of animal sacrifice and their disparagement of Paul who was their persecutor as Saul of Tarsus.  The New Testament doesn't try to hide this and even Paul admitted that he persecuted the early church.    The "Hellenists" were banished from Jerusalem and later developed their own theology which is reflected in the Pseudo-Clementines.  The Jerusalem community under the leadership of James was allowed to stay and thrive for at least a while.     This book clears up so many misconceptions about early Christianity and should be back in print.  Put it back in print and I'll buy a copy.
