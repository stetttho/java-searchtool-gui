 Science itself has proven that the greatest mystery in human history, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, is still an unsolved mystery. The author is neither a theologian, clergyman, scientist, nor fiction writer.  He is an attorney, which makes him uniquely qualified to gather facts from different experts and present his case before the reader. He has done an outstanding job with this book. Antonacci begins the book by proving historically that the shroud is much older than the carbon dating that was performed on it.  Then he moves into the scientific realm, explaining how biology can disprove the dating. Alot of time is spent in disproving all of the theories of how the image got on the cloth and at times is a little tedious but very thorough. The climax at the end of the book is when the image is explained by nuclear physics.  This is when it really gets interesting and leaves us wondering if the Biblical account shouldn't be taken at its word. The author clearly makes the point that the shroud should be the most important relic in Christendom, for here we have the greatest proof that the resurrection of Christ really did occur as it is recorded in the Bible.
