 Don't get me wrong - I know "I Love Lucy" is Lucille Ball's masterpiece but we have been "I Love Lucy"ed out with TV Land showing it continously.  "The Lucy Show", her show from the 60's, and "Here's Lucy" from the 70's, are ones I remember but would love to see again.  They are underrated and would give us and the 21st century viewers something different from "ILL" all the time.  I applaud this release and hope that whomever has "The Lucy Show" rights will see fit to release them as well as more "Here's Lucy."
