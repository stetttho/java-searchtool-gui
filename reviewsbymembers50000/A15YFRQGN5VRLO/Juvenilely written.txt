 This book has the feel it was written by a middle school student.  While I applaud the author's efforts to get a book written about Joan Fontaine, this is a mess.  It has no consistency; he jumps from when Fontaine and her sister, Olivia deHavilland, were children, to a chapter on when they were competitors for the 1941 Best Actress Oscar and back again.  Also, he mentions KathErine Hepburn several times; being a longtime Hollywood correspondent, surely he knows Miss Hepburn spelled her name KathArine, not KathErine.    A glaring thing the author points out is Olivia snubbed Joan in 1950 when she won her "The Heiress" Oscar.  That snub was in 1947, when Olivia won for "To Each His Own."  Apparently the author didn't check various Oscar histories.  Also, one time he calls the sisters' father, William de Havilland, when it was Walter de Havilland.  He also mentions that Jennifer Jones beat Joan for the 1943 Oscar and the author aludes that Joan was nominated for "This Above All," when in fact, her 1943 nomination was for "The Constant Nymph," a film he obviously hasn't seen.  Also, why does he capitalize the term 'American Classic' when referring to "Rebecca"?  The only saving virtue of this SLIM, SLIM book is the photos.  Joan must have autographed them for the author as her autograph appears on almost every one, but while we've seen the most of them before, it's a nice addition.  The photo part is the majority of the book.  The author's grammar and English structure are horrible.  Short cut-off sentences, nothing flows like a good narrative should. He also only appears to have seen a handful of Joan's pictures, notably "Rebecca" and "Suspicion."  Nothing here new on the continuing rivalary between these two actresses, but it's worth having for the photos.  Don't expect much from the narrative, it'll leave you wanting.
