 It is WONDERFUL!!!  What more could one ask for from the Golden Age of Hollywood:  Producer David O. Selznick(he did a little something called "Gone With the Wind" - you may not remember that one....), beautiful Jennifer Jones, a young Gregory Peck, stalwart support from Joseph Cotten, a crotchtedy Lionel Barrymore, a luminious Lillian Gish, supendous 3-strip Technicolor, a decent story for a western(my least favorite movie genre), and a history that would equal Selznick's other "little movie" - GWTW.  The DVD of this does the film justice, although some commentary or other supporting features would have been fantastic.  I have the Anchor Bay releases of this film and just got this MGM release-they seem to be taken from the same source material, which is very, very good.  This film's reputation needs to be defended - sure it was shocking in 1947, but in 2004, they could probably touch on these topics in an "Waltons" or "Litte House" episode.  Judge for yourself - get this movie - you won't be disappointed!!
