 This is one of the most underrated, overlooked films of Hollywood's Golden Era, the 1940's.  I cannot understand why this film has been lamblasted over the years.  It is a compelling, superbly acted drama from a famous play.  Perhaps it was a dud in 1947, but the years have erased that, and I applaud loudly to Image for putting it on DVD.  Never on VHS or laserdisc, it is time it was available to the home video market.  If you want to see motion picture acting at its best, watch Russell, Redgrave, Paxinou, and Massey here.  It's all been done recently - all these plot elements have been done on "Dallas," "Dynasty," and "Knots Landing" and countless daytime soaps.  But this is the ORIGINAL.  Watch it and relish what great moviemaking and acting is.
