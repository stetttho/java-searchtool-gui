 As a fan of the great Disney villains, I eagerly looked toward this release, thinking I could see my favorites in one film.  Well, WRONG!  This is nothing but a series of Mickey/Donald/Goofy shorts strung together with a Halloween motif.  You see the Disney villains on the front and back of the DVD cover, inside on the insert, but hardly in the movie!  I don't know why the Disney folks allowed this sham to take place. If they wanted to release these Mickey, et al shorts, do it without the idea of the Disney villains.  There is one scene where the villains sing a Broadway-like number, but it is too brief to be enjoyable.  Maleficent, Cinderella's stepmother, etc are all relegated to just scenes where they sit in a cocktail-like sitting watching these mini-cartoons of Mickey and his friends.  Knowing the likes of Maleficent, etc, they wouldn't stand for such goings-on!  This is like watching Disney Animation 101 with the guise of Advanced Disney Masterpiece.  AVOID!
