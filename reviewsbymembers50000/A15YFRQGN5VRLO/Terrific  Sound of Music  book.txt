 Charmian Carr has written a lovely tribute to this movie, which is one of the great hits in the history of American film.  It certainly has a special place in my life, as it has for almost 27 years. Ms. Carr recognizes the  adoration people have for this film, and she writes about it accordingly.   What I think is special about her and her authorship of this book, is that  she APPRECIATES her fans, fans of the movie, and is quick to acknowledge  this in the narrative.  I admire this tremendously.  So many actors that  appear in such a celebrated film shun fans and devotees and regard them as  no doubt obsessive and looney.  Charmian does none of this.  She  continously credits viewers of "Music" with its success. This  book is a leisurely read, easy to like, not too long and yet not too short.   As a "Music" fan, I personally would have liked it longer, but  nevertheless, it is a comprehensive account of one of the masterworks of  film musicals. Thank you, Charmian Carr, for being one of "My  Favorite Things" for 35 years!
