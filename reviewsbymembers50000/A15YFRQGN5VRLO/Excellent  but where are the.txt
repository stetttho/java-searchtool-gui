 EXTRAS ON THE DVD?  Why no director commentary, interviews, nothing?  This is a superbly acted and fascinating film, but that is it.  One is left to wonder what went on behind the making of this film but we have a bare-bones DVD.  Oh, well, they'll probably come out with another one in a year or so that we'll have to buy again for extras...........
