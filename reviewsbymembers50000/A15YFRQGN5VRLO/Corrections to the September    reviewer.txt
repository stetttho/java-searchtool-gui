 This reviewer wonders why Gable, Leigh and/or deHavilland couldn't have "sat down" and conversed with Leonard Malton on this timeless film.  Well, for starters, Gable has been deceased for 44 years and Leigh for 37 and no director from the film is alive either in 2004.  Pretty hard to do that when you don't exist anymore.  Further, Leonard Malton was even a movie critic when Gable and Leigh were alive.  Also, Miss deHavilland does have a special place on this new DVD version - a 2004 interview with her on the film.  Also, the film was not "handpainted", it was filmed in 3-strip Technicolor which while a novelty in 1939, nevertheless was a viable film process.
