 I have seen this film about 3 times and each time I find the same feeling, one of boredom.  It's too long for one thing for such a thin plot.  On the good side, Caine is good, the look and feel of the swingin' London '60's is good from a sociological point of view and Vivien Merchant is wonderful in a supporting role as a mature woman who is impregnated with Alfie's baby and has an abortion, which no doubt was daring for the 60's.  Suffice it to say that the movie hasn't weathered well in the 38 years since its release, but it's an interesting watchpiece of the '60's, if you can stay awake during the long stretches of boredom.
