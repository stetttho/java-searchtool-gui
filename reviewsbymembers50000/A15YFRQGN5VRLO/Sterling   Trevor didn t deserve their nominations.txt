 Claire Trevor and Jan Sterling were nominated for best supporting actress Academy Awards for this picture in '54 and lost to Eva Marie Saint of "On the Waterfront."  After seeing the film after its long habitation, Trevor and Sterling weren't really deserving of their nominations.  Their roles do define supporting but there is nothing standing-out in their performances.  Of course, Trevor hams it up in her good ol' dame role she played so well, but this year, the Oscars were on the money by giving it to Saint for "Waterfront."  The other 2 nominees for supporting actress 1954 were Nina Foch for "Executive Suite" and Katy Jurado for "Broken Lance."  Jurado certainly didn't deserve her nomination either - nothing memorable, Foch was o.k.
