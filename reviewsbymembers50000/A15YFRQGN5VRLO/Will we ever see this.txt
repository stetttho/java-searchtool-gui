 in WIDESCREEN???? I have loved this film for years and have the original MCA videotape, the original MCA laserdisc, and this horrible Goodtimes DVD.  CAN'T SOMEONE GET THIS FILM TRANSFERRED TO SEE IN WIDESCREEN?  Turner Classic Movies is the only source where I've seen it in widescreen.  Thank God for TCM! Perhaps one day...........
