 We wanted to buy our son a new toy so I took him to the toy store and asked him what he wanted.  Immediately he went for the tow truck (he had been talking about it for a week).  There were probably 4 or 5 to choose from, but he was instantly captivated by this one.  There are buttons to press that simulate the engine cranking, wench winding, etc. And if you're like me, the batteries are easy to remove - and to put back in. The only thing that wasn't that durable was the string and plastic hook that you could use to tow another toy.  The plastic hook broke on the second day (with rough use), but the truck overall is great.  A perfect gift for a 3 or 4 year old boy.
