 I too, first heard this collection of songs at Gymboree (which is a great  play program, I think).  One day on the way home, I heard my two-and-a-half  year old singing the songs from class.  On a whim, I bought the tape and  that has been the best cassette I've bought in a long time.  Whenever he  gets a little antsy or uncomfortable in his car seat, I just pop in the  tape and we start singing.  Also, because the songs tell stories that you  act out it's also a good exercise tape for toddlers.
