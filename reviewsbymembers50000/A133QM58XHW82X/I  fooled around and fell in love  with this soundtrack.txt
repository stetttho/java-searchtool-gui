 I am a huge fan of soundtracks specifically for the variety and the mood they create.  This one does a fabulous job in both categories.  I really enjoy this CD because it does have some of the more popular 70s songs, but they aren't all disco.  (Ok, so "Dancin' Queen" is my favorite song.)  Nevertheless, if you liked the movie then you'll love the soundtrack.
