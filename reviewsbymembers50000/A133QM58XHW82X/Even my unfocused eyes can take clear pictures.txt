 I received this camera as a gift for my birthday 2 years ago and I've taken so many pictures since.  Mostly of our 2 year old (what else would you expect of a first-time Mom?).  The color and crispness of the pictures is excellent; better than I expected for a camera at this price.  Loading and unloading the film is a breeze, and it's so lightweight it's not a bother to hang around your neck (like some others are).  I would recommend it for the amateur or pro photographer.
