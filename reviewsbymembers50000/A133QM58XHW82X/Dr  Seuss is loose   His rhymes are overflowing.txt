 His rhymes are overflowing in this very entertaining book. Some are ridiculous, others are fun. One thing is for certain though, it does expand a child's vocabulary.  I noticed that when my toddler and I read other Dr. Seuss works (like Hop On Pop, Yertle The Turtle, ...Mulberry Street).  We have the small board book version which is great to take along in the car and also small enough to take to restuarants.  If there's a long wait for our order, we just read the book.  And my, oh my -- how time flies!
