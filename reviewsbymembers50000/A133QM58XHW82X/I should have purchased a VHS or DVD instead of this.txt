 I think my son would have enjoyed watching Barney and his friends since holiday songs rather than just listen to them.  It is a very upbeat tape/CD and your young children will probably like it.  We just don't play it very often because it can (and does) get on your nerves.   If you're looking for Barney holiday-stuff, I would suggest a video rather than just the music.  That's just my opinion, I could be wrong.
