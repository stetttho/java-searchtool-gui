 I bought this book after reading the positive customer reviews and the high 'average rating'.  My two-and-a-half year old son really enjoys the  book and understands the concept of "go sit on potty", but I  don't believe the book has help him all that much.  In fact, the first week  we had the book I probably read it to him 3-4 times a day.  Now when he's  sitting on the potty he prefers "The Little Engine That Could"  (no pun intended).  It's been a couple of months now and he is still in  Pull-Ups.  I'm considering using the book in combination with a Potty Dotty  doll or something similar. Again, the book is well written and easy to  understand but I think, from personal experience, it doesn't promote  enthusiasm in the child.
