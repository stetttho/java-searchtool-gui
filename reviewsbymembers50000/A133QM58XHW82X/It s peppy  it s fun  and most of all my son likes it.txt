 Ok, so we all know that parents and young children have very different tastes in music. I actually LIKE these songs.  My 3 yr old son and I dance and sing and laugh at the silly words to some of the songs.  When he gets the giggles really bad now, I ask him if he ate a slice of "Sillie Pie".  And the "Aba Daba Honeymoon" song cracks him up.   Most 3 year olds I know aren't music critics (yet) and this tape gets him moving and dancing.  And me too sometimes. The artist has a great singing voice and I like that so much more than the character-sung albums like "Barney" and "Sesame Street" not to mention the infamous "Chimpmunks Christmas".
