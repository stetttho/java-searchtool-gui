 especially with our 3-year-old son. He has such a short attention span, but this one interested him a lot.  I think the mixture of characters (people, cats, mice, etc.) made it more appealing.  I personally only saw about half the movie, but I adored the cats (Especially Snowbell).   It's purely fantasy (a couple with a son adopt a mouse?????) however, it is an entertaining movie that parents should not be concered about their kids viewing.  Adults might even like it too.
