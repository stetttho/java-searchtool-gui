 I bought this for my 1-year-old daughter who has so many other toys and was pleasantly surprised how much she enjoyed it.  The toy is educational in that it teaches colors, numbers, etc. similar to other toys for this age range, but it does it in a different manner.  The momma bird and baby bird are just too cute!  I highly recommend this durable and educational toy.
