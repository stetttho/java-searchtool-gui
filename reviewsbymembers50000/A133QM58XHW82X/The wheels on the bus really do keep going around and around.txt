 This is one of the best toys we have for our two and a half year old son. Even when he was only 8-9 months old, he was fascinated with cars, trucks,  anything that had wheels and would roll.  So when he first received the  Little Peoples Bus (about 14 months old) he loved to just roll it around  and watch the eyes in the front rotate.  Then, his playtime with the bus  got a little more complicated: he started moving the passengers around and  opening the door for them to enter and exit.  This toy has really sparked  his imagination as he now assigns them duties (i.e. the driver) and turns  their heads so they can "look out the window".  I think this is a  great educational toy and highly recommend it.  I'm proud of my son and the  concepts he's learned by playing with the Little Peoples School Bus.
