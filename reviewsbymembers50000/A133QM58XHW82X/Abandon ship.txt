 As cute as it is, this boat stinks.... I mean, sinks.  The body of the ship is very durable and heavy; maybe that's why it sinks so easily.  And the flag pole falls out way too easily, posing a choking hazard for any child who likes to put things in their mouths.  Like another reviewer said, it was more fun for my son to float Ernie and Elmo in plastic bowls in the tub.  I wouldn't recommend it, even as a gift (that's how we acquired ours).
