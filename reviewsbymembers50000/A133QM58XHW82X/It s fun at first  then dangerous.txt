 I remember having a Corn Popper when I was little, and my husband does too.  What we didn't recall when we purchased it for our son was how incredibly LOUD and ANNOYING it is when you're not the one playing with it. When our son was first learning to walk it was a really neat incentive for him -- to push it and see/hear the balls popping.  Then it was to run and make the balls pop faster, and faster, and faster, and - you get the point.  Now, because the toy is so lightweight, he can lift it in the air and sometimes slams it down on a table or sofa.  Boys will be boys (as they say) so I've decided it's time to pass it along to someone else (donation). I know he had a good time playing with it, but he's had more fun with other toys.  Let's just say our next child won't be "popping corn".
