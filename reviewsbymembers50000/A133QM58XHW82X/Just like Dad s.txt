 My 3-year-old son absolutely loves this shop vac.  He received it from Santa this year and used it all day Christmas Day.  I have to admit he's a bit rough on toys and after reading the other person's review I thought maybe he might break it within a day, but no.  It's still going strong.  And it's still his favorite toy he received this christmas.
