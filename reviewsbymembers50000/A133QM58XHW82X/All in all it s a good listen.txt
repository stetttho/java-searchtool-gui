 However, a couple of songs that are included on the British version of this CD should have been included with this release as well.  "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" added a lot of character to the film but isn't on the American CD.  Also, The Pretender's "Don't Get Me Wrong" is a fantastic song that was perfect for the film, however, did not make it to this soundtrack.   I should have purchased the British version of Bridget Jones's Diary [SOUNDTRACK] and would have been happier.  You won't be dissappointed with that purchase.
