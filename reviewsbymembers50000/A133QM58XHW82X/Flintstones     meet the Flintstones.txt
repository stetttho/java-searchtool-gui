 This sturdy car for preschoolers reminds me of the car Fred and Barney used to ride in on 'The Flintstones' cartoon.  My son loves this toy - who wouldn't want a brand new car? At first he just pushed it around, then he put Teddy Bear in the car and gave him a ride.  Now he can successfully maneuver frontward, backward, and turning the wheel.  But of course he likes the horn the most.  We use it inside in our big family room when the weather isn't nice, and we take it outside when it is nice.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.
