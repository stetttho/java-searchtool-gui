 Kenneth R.  Timmerman's book is a great public service.  "Exposing the real Jesse Jackson" is a most appropriate subtitle.  You should read this book to see the exposed Jesse Jackson: - a ruthless man who lied and cheated to promote himself and destroy those who spoke the truth about him.  	 - a talented con-artist who used gangster tactics, cronies, connections, and threats to amass a fortune and build a black family dynasty.   - a greedy, self-serving opportunistic hustler who inflamed and exploited the race relationship to empower and enrich himself and his cronies. But all of the above, revulsive as they are, are trivial - they are industry standard for politicians.  That is why no established politicians want or dare to tangle with him. Jesse Jackson's contorted success was no doubt helped by the politician's cowardice, the media bias, and Bill Clinton's patronage. The real tragedy is that the "Reverend" Mr. Jackson has poisoned the race relationship in America, and by promoting a thesis that black's success depended on preferential treatment and their failure were due to racism, he mortgaged the character of his own people.  Poor blacks growing up with this man as their morale compass will get hopelessly lost. Jesse Jackson is no Martin Luther King Jr.  He has nothing to do with civil rights.  He is a crook.   Hooray for Kenneth R Timmerman, Bill O'reilly, T. J. Rodgers, and others who dare to take him on and expose him.
