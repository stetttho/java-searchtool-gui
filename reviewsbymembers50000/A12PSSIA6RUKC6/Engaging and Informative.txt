 I enjoyed reading To Rule the Waves very much and, quite frankly, was a bit dismayed in reading the reviews here to find that there were a number of factual and typographical errors.  Nonetheless, I found this book well worth my limited reading time, as it is informative and truly engaging.    The history of the Royal Navy is essentially a history of the emergence and decline of the British Empire.  Reliving this history from the angle of the Royal Navy, with unvarnished assessments on luminaries from Hawkins, Drake, Anson, Cook, Nelson all the way to Churchill, and their adversaries, has been a welcome educational experience for me.  For the history of the Royal Navy is not just about sea battles; it is also about navigational technology, exploration, colonization, combating piracy and slave trade, quest for knowledge about nature, etc. all of which the Royal Navy had taken a lead role.  The Royal Navy is a great institution.  It is certainly not without flaws and its history is not without unglamorous passages.  It is, nonetheless, the embodiment of the strength and character and resourcefulness of the British nation and her people.  To Rule the Waves tells a compelling story of history.
