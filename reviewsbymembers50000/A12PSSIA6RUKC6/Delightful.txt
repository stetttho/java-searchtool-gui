 The Code Book is a delightful treatment of the subject of cryptography.  It is a nice combination of history, science, warfare and politics. The author uses interesting historical events as background to narrate the different phases of what might be called the mainstream developments of cryptography and cryptanalysis.  It is a captivating presentation. The book started off with the story of Queen Mary of Scotland, and went on to cover the Caesar cipher, Vigenre cipher, the famous Enigma, the super-secret Colossus, and the modern day computer based encryption and decryption developments.  The author also threw in a couple of interesting "sideline" stories, such as the Beale cipher, the Rosetta Stone, and the Navajo "code talkers" who played a key role in the Pacific theater during WWII. My teenage son used to complain that most of the difficult subjects he learned in school would never have any use in real life.  I gave him a copy of this book.  The book is a compelling story of how science, engineering, mathematics, computer, linguistics, psychology are all critical pieces of this all-important game. There are more technical treatises on this subject, and there are more lengthy and nuanced historical accounts on military intelligence as well.  But this book is undoubtedly the best introduction to this uniquely fascinating subject.
