 This "dictionary" is so "highly selective" that it is not all that useful as a reference. If you encounter a word you want to look up, your chance of finding it in this dictionary is near zero. It should be more appropriately named as a collection of certain less frequently used words. If you read this book from cover to cover, you will probably find that you know many of the words already and, of the ones you don't know, you may retain a few of them. Well, I am probably not "extraordinarily literate."
