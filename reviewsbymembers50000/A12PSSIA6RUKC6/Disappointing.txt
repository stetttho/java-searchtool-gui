 After reading this book, the question looms large as to why Dr. Kissinger bothered to "write" it.  It is essentially a selected collection of phone logs between Dr. Kissinger and his cohorts during the Yom Kippur War and the last days of the Vietnam War.  If you are halfway interested in politics and history, there is nothing in this book that you don't already know, other than being able to glean through the actual words spoken by the policy makers of the time - what was "behind the scenes" was not startlingly different than what was on the TV screen. I am disappointed with this book, not least because I am much impressed by Dr. Kissinger's other work, especially his defining tome: Diplomacy. I am thankful for the tip given by the previous reviewer from Amsterdam, pointing out where to get the declassified information from the NSA.  He was right.  The account (of the Yom Kippur War) from the declassified NSA documents was more succinct, balanced and overall more informative.
