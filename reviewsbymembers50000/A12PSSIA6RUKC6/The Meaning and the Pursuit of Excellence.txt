 This book is much more than cataloguing accomplishments of the arts and sciences and adjudicating their relative greatness.  More importantly, this is a book about the meaning and the pursuit of excellence. Murray has an important message, which crystallizes toward the end of the book.  An important part of the human spirit, after the basic needs of survival and procreation are met, is its natural attraction to truth, beauty and good.  (This is the best elaboration I have seen of what is meant by the "pursuit of Happiness" in our Declaration of Independence)  Given the right cultural climate, the emergence of excellence in the pursuit of truth, beauty and good, will thrive. I do not know if Murray had that message in mind and used the data to support it, or that he analyzed the data to conclude on that message.  Either way, the message is powerful. Murray also made the point the religion (not organized religion, but a mature contemplation of truth, beauty and good) and its contagiousness is what is behind the waves of achievements and discoveries in history, entailing superhuman efforts and sacrifices that produced the greatest art and the articulation of the most insightful truths. There is in this book a detail list of "inventories" of great and significant figures and an elaboration of how they are selected, with special consideration -- allowing quotas, if you will -- for non-Western achievements.  The inventories will undoubtedly generate a lot of debate from the PC crowd.  Murray anticipated that and did quite a bit of that debate within the book.  If you are a serious reader of the book, you will find that the inventories, despite the amount of space devoted to them, are mere launching pad for the thesis of what is the meaning of excellence. Like "The Bell Curve", this book is not for everybody.  But for those who are drawn to the pursuit and appreciation of greatness and deference to truth, this book resonates powerfully with the mind.
