 Serious readers of Levitt's book should know that the abortion research, as it relates to crime rate, has very recently been critically reviewed by Christopher Foote, an economist at the Boston Fed, and his assistant Christopher Goetz.  The pair found that the there were significant flaws in the formulation of Levitt's original research and as a result some factors, such as the crack wave and the arrest statistics, were either not correctly accounted for, or not accounted for at all.  The net effect was that when the new factors were taken into account correctly, the abortion and crime rate correlation was much weaker.  Close observers of this "issue" agree that Levitt's research was the result of careful work and praised him for making his data and methodology easily available for review.  The new finding did not conclude that the correlation was bogus; but that it was weaker than originally argued.
