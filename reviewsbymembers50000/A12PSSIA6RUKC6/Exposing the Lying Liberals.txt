 It is wonderful to have authors like Larry Elder to write books like Showdown.  This very readable book addresses the mass audience on a serious subject of media bias and to debunk the ultra-liberal litany that has saturated the broadcast network and the "mainstream" print media, and at the same time offers an alternative, positive outlook for the vast captive constituency of the Victicrats.  Elder's book covers much ground on the socio-political landscape.  He exposes what is oftentimes craftily hidden from news stories.  One striking example captured in this book: to what length would a liberal go to deceive his audience?  Just listen to Stephan Schneider, and environment "scientist", who famously said, and defended "...we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have...Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest."  I am sure the reader will be able to come up with a much less torturous sentence by using a three-letter verb. Elder devotes a good portion of this book to address the predicament of the black and Hispanic communities.  Elder himself is one of the many many examples of how the right set of values, role models and hard work and perseverance can bring success to people despite formidable adversity.  Of course, success manifest in many ways; few people, regardless of race, are able to achieve to the level of Larry Elder.  He, along with Thomas Sowell, Alan Kayes, Walter Williams, Clarence Thomas, and many whose name I might not be familiar, are great heroes and role models for blacks (and indeed for all of us.)
