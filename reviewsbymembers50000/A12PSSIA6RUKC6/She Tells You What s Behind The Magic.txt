 I am a learning watercolor artist and I read many books on the subject.  This is one of a handful that I find to be particularly informative. While most art instruction books tell you what to do and how to do it, Jeanne Dobie patiently explains why. In other words, she tells you what is behind the magic.  For example, she says that you cannot get a good green by mixing any yellow and any blue, because, a yellow such as cadmium yellow contains some red and a blue such as ultramarine also contains some red, and the presence of red in green (the hoped-for color), which are complements on the color wheel, yields gray.  Thus the resulting green is very muted.  Explanations such as this are invaluable to me, because the underlying reasons she gives completely convinces me that she is right and the knowledge is extensible to other color combinations. There are many such gems of knowledge in this book.  Jeanne Dobie teaches you how to create not just contrast, but a "singing" combination of colors, and how to mix your own blacks and your own whites to achieve much more nuanced presentations.  And there is much more. Admittedly, some artists do not feel bound by these "rules" of color and can still produce very good art.  Charles Reid comes to mind.  For the rest of us, the wisdoms Jeanne Dobie shares in this book are an important part of an artist's knowledge base.
