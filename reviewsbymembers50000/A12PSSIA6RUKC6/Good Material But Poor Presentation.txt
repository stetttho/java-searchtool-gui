 For a book with a subject as serious as this one, "Dependent on D.C." is unfortunately quite poorly executed. First, the book is not about dependency on the government per se, although the author argues that such is the end result. The book is really about how politicians deceive the American people by concealing, withholding and misrepresenting information - in short, by lying, and how decades of growth of government power has resulted in such entrenched bureaucracy, power base, incentive structure and dumbing-down of the public, that the trend is practically irreversible, short of a revolt - according to the author. Reading this book tries one's patience. The author apparently has not thought through who her audience was, whether it was her academia cohort or the broader reading public. She uses economics jargons where simple words would quite suffice; she uses the term "transaction cost" in almost every sentence in the first chapters and it makes you think that a robot is talking to you. Then again, she makes the same points over and over again, paragraph after paragraph. To her credit, the author has chosen a worthwhile subject and has done meticulous research. And she does offer some valuable insights. This book is for you if you are seriously interested in the history of the administrative state and an analysis of the underpinning political dynamics, and do not mind the rather tiresome style of presentation.
