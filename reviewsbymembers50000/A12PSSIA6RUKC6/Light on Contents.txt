 The concept of the book is excellent.  The presentation is also very good.  But it is pretty lightweight.  It does not have enough contents to serve as a reference, nor do I think, after paging through this book, that was what the author had in mind. I have several books I stuff in the car for light reading while I am waiting for people or traffic.  This book belongs there.
