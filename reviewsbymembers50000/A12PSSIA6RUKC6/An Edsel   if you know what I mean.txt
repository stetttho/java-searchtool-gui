 This machine is very poorly designed.  And it worked even more poorly.  Every moment you use it, you carry around yards of hose and a bulky brush you just about never use (why was it not detachable?).  There is a series to lights to tell you if you are moving too fast (why not just say "move slowly to get best results"?)  The bladder design is clever but not practical, as the container is virtually impossible to clean.  The dumbest part of the design is the "smartmix" bottle that dispenses soap.  The pump for the "smartmix" soap bottle broke within a month. And then the valve has to be set in two positions everytime you turn the machine on or refill the water of soap.  And that valve also broke (why not make it simple and design it so that the soap is added to the water?)  The Bissell Protech is the product of sloppy engineers working with feature-driven marketers.  All bells and whistles with little practical worth.
