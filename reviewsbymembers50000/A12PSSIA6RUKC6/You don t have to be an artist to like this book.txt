 This book contains many beautiful drawings that illustrate the techniques in expressing the human figure.  True, it is not an instructional book in that it does not provide step-by-step instructions to arrive at an end result.  Nonetheless, Ambrus's comments revealed a bit of the workings of  his mind as he approached his subjects, and they provide a good deal of  insight into the how these drawings are put together, such as which parts  of a figure in each case are most attention-demanding, etc.   This book  is an excellent reference for the artist.  Its drawings are so beautiful  and plentiful that it also belongs on the coffee table!
