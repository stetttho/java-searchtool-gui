 In the campuses of the institutions of American higher education, from the Ivy League to community colleges, the First Amendment and had given way to political correctness. The spirit of liberty - freedom of expression and freedom of academic inquiry, was under senseless assault. Students and faculties alike were silenced by speech codes, intimidated and persecuted by secret kangaroo judicial apparatus controlled by radical liberals, save a few brave souls such as Kors and Silverglate. Kors and Silverglate barely lifted a rock so huge by a crack as to allow us to see some of the ugliness underneath. The university administrators proclaimed their allegiance to academic freedom, but in the same breath denounced "offensive" expressions. What an irony! And nothing is offensive when it is directed against conservative values; everything is offensive when one is not in concert with the race and gender radicals. The blatant double standard insults one's intelligence. The casualties have been heavy. Countless students and faculty members succumbed to this onslaught. Many were silenced or coerced to admit to false charges. Some suffer much greater losses such as expulsion (students) and termination (faculty), without any semblance of due process. Why do most universities keep their disciplinary proceedings secret? Anything that has to be kept secret is highly suspect. And, of course, when one is brave and resourceful enough to take the matter to a court of law, the administrators run for cover.  This book is very well researched and equally well written. (I love historians, they are such good prose writers.) I myself have been considerably educated by it on the subject of the interpretation of the First and the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Court's ginger handling of academic freedom. As the author said "Sunlight is the best disinfectant." This book is sunlight. Great work.
