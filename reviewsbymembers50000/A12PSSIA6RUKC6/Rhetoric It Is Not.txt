 Danielle Crittenden does a great service to this generation of young women and men by presenting some well-researched facts and well-thought-out ideas on the subject of male-female relationship in this very readable book. As a middle-aged man, my interest in a book titled as this one was initially very low.  However, I find myself very much absorbed as I started to turn the pages. Miss Crittenden took on a very complex and controversial subject in what might be called a contrarian approach, and presented some revealing facts, refreshing ideas and insightful analysis.  With so much poisonous theories and commentary that built and shaped the gender battlefront, which should never have been, this book is one that invites the readers to take a rational look at what women really want from the opposite sex and the society at large.   If you have a daughter (or friend) at her late teens or early twenties, you should introduce her to this book.  Yes, it could be life-changing for her.
