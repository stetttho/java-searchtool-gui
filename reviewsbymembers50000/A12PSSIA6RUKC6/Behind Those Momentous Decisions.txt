 "First Among Equals" is an interesting book about the U.S. Supreme Court authored by an experienced legal practitioner - Kenneth Starr, who needs no introduction. This book is intended for the lay person; it has no legal jargon and is very readable.  It is organized around a set of constitutional issues as illustrated by what might be called some of the landmark cases pertaining to those issues.  Starr manages to lay out highly legalistic issues in simple terms without diluting their significance, and in the process walks the reader through the history of the Court since the New Deal Court, all the way to the most recent Rehnquist Court decisions.  The Court's history, as such, in large measure reflects the Nation's history as seen through the litigation of some of the most controversial issues - abortion, free speech, church and state, criminal justice, affirmative action, federalism, etc.   In telling his story, Starr puts great emphasis on the background and judicial philosophy of the individual justices, which puts a human dimension to an otherwise academic subject. "First Among Equals" is a worthwhile effort that bridges a gap between the highly legalistic arguments and the ordinary people, whose life are profoundly affected by the decisions of the Court.  For anyone who is interested in rendering after-dinner opinions on events in the political, social and legal landscapes, this book is an invaluable backgrounder.
