 This book is not one of the best among those in the Dover Art Library.  A handful (about a half-dozen) of pictures are good with sufficient details and/or a tight organization to be appreciated.  Most are so-so.  Some are definitely fillers.  It does not help that Rubens himself, according to the Publisher's Note, did not think highly of his own drawings and did not even sign a single one of them. All told, this selection is not impressive. Rubens's paintings, rather than his drawings,  should rightly be his legacy.
