 This book is not about science, but science gossip.  As a purveyor of gossip it does a marvelous job.  It tells you more than you ever want to know about the background of some discoveries and the human side of some of the big names in science and technology.   Bryson sourced his materials from an impressive array of books and other publications and weaved them into a readable, almost connected, set of essays.  As we all know, just because something appears in print does not mean it is true, and just because something is true does not mean it is the whole story, much less an objective one.  I don't know how much of the material has been independently confirmed. Unlike most other books of this genre, which focus on informing the lay reader on the science and the scientists, and add some gossip to liven things up, this book is full of gossip and has scant retainable information.   It is not a bad book to kill time on a plane and be entertained; it is just not particularly useful.
