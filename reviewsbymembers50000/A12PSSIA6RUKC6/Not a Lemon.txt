 This is usual fare of local landscape, climate, customs, folklore and a series of big and small endeavors and adventures of various sorts, rendered with a lucid style of writing and the English humor.  It was fun reading and you vicariously enjoy the charmed life in a peasant farm nestled in the hills of the Spanish Andalucia.    I wish there had been a warning at the beginning of the chapter entitled "The Time of Matanzas" which contained a ghastly depiction of the killing of pigs that was a local custom.  Although the description was but a few sentences, being of the faint of heart, I wish I had not read it.  Another could-have-been-better is that the book has reproductions of some interesting photographs but in pitifully small formats - typically with a short side of only 3.5 cm. All in all, this is one of the best travel memoirs around.  Despite my petty complaints, I recommend it highly.
