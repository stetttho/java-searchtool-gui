 This is the first book I read of Paul Johnson's that is not a kilopage tome.   In less than 200 pages, Johnson gave the Renaissance a most delightful treatment.   This book will disappoint those who try to look for exhaustive treatment of any area of literature and art of that fabulous era, or of any of the fabled masters.  But it delights the reader with a short tour of the Renaissance Italy (and to a lesser degree, Europe) by vivid illustrations of some of the most outstanding literary, architecture and artistic accomplishments and the personalities behind them. A most valuable part of this small volume is its casting of the Renaissance in a historical and geographical context.  What brought about this marvelous revival of high arts?  How was it related to the Gothic tradition?  How some "imported" technologies, such as the movable type printing press from Germany and the oil paint from the Low Countries, were enthusiastically adopted by the Italians in propagating ideas and revolutionizing art forms. How the guild system produced successive generations of artists and also contemporaneous competition.  Roles played by local politics and art patrons, and, of course, the church.  And how eventually the French and German invasions from the north undermined the power foundation of this spectacular flowering of the arts, while ushering in the era of Reformation and the Baroque. As a short history book - rather than a subject matter book - I find it informative, illuminating and well worth a couple of evening's reading time.
