 Thomas Sowell's "A Conflict of Visions" is a remarkable book.  The author's objective portrayal of the two conflicting visions, their premises, their history and their wide ranging implications and  ramifications is an excellent education for all who have a serious interest  in social and economic policies, as well as politics. Like Dr. Sowell's  other books,  "A Conflict of Visions" was the product of  meticulous research, objective analysis and much original thought.  In my  opinion, few people in the public arena today are as brilliant and as well  informed as Dr. Sowell.  If you ever wondered why the same two camps of  voices combat each other on issue after issue, in politics, in law, in  economics and in social policies, if you ever wondered why no unequivocal  truth emerged from the conflicting premises through more than 200 years of  war and peace, and if you ever wondered (this is the kicker!) why one  side's vitriolic portrayal of the other side met with a generally  benevolent counter portrayal, you will find the answers in Dr. Sowell's  theory of conflicting visions.  Reading this book is like discovering  Newtonian mechanics.   "A Conflict of Visions" is not an easy  read.   However, you won't soon forget its ideas.
