 Professor Jensen's work on mental abilities, as summarized in this book, examines the different aspects of intelligence in a great deal of detail, including the history of the subject along with the work of early researchers, the different schools of thought, the biological correlates, heritability, environmental factors, the gender and race differences and plausible explanations, the role of intelligence in a person's development and the social implications.  The subject of human intelligence had been a controversial one since its conception.  To claim that different people have different levels of intelligence runs counter to the cherished notion that all men are created equal.  However, empirical evidence is overwhelming that every human being is not born with equal potential. Some people do not like the findings of scientific studies because the findings undermine the premises of their belief, and they tend to attack and discredit the scientist and impugn his motive.  Others may not like the findings but accept them if they are satisfied that the findings are the results of scientific methods.  This book appeals to the latter group, as the professor was very meticulous in explaining the hypothesis, the experiment, the data, and the analysis.  He was very candid about what he was sure and what he was not so sure and why. I learned a lot about the subject of human intelligence from this book.  More importantly, as I read this book, I could see that even as the professor pursues the subject with uncommon vigor, he is also a healthy all-around skeptic and would not rest until all arguments, including "rival" ideas, have been thought through.  For this reason, I believe what I learned is the best knowledge to date of the subject. If you are seriously interested in the subject of mental abilities, there is frankly no substitute to this book.
