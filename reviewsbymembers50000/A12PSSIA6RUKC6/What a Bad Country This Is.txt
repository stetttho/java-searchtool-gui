 According to People's History of the United States, this country is a bad country, conceived and built by bad people with bad motives, did nothing but bad things throughout its history, and continues to infest the world with bad things and bad ideas to this day. If one wants to write about bad things in a democracy, he should know two things: 1. (Quoting Winston Churchill: ) "Democracy is the worst form of all governments - except compared with all other forms of government."  Nonetheless, the list of bad things in a democracy is endless. 2. One of those bad things is that it produces lots of vitriolic cynics, like the author of this book, and they can still find voice. Try to write People's History of the People's Republic of China, and you'll be in jail before can say Tien An Men Square.  Howard Zinn's system is saturated with class, race and gender hatred that is at the core of the divisive politics of today. This book caters to the blame-America-for-everything crowd, and will find enthusiastic consumers.
