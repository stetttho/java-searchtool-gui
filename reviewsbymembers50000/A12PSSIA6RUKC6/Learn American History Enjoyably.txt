 Paul Johnson's "A History of the American People" is written for the American people. And, like his other books, this 900 page volume is beautifully written. Being an immigrant, I was not formally taught the history of America, and until I read Johnson's book, I did not have a good understanding of the history of this great country. This book is splendidly done! Johnson chooses his material with shrewdness, does his research with care, and presents it with a fair mind despite his ideology. Whether or not you have had high school or freshman American history, this book will enrich you with a cohesive presentation of American history. You also get the benefit of the analysis, evaluation and interpretation of people, events, conflicts, and epochal transitions by a historian of the highest caliber.   You will get to see a little of the imperfections of even the most revered of our leaders, but you will also see how these leaders courageously steered the course of the country at important junctures, politically, militarily, economically, and culturally, and made this country what it is today. And be proud to be an American.
