 Many excellent reviews have been written for this book and quite frankly I can add little more.  But I cannot resist writing a few words after reading and tremendously enjoying this rather charming memoir. The author chronicled her somewhat adventurous settling in the Italian Riviera through (almost impulsively) buying a very old farmhouse - with a few dozen olive trees to go with it, and struggling to make it a home, and herself and her sister part of the community.  San Pietro was not exactly known for being hospitable to outsiders, how did this pair of foreign females (extra virgins) manage to get accepted as part of the community - in fact, practically as everyone's darlings?  Well, they were friendly, respectful, open-minded, conscientious, and armed with a tremendous sense of humor. Besides learning a good deal about the life style and food fares of the Northern Italian peasantry, the landscape and climate of the place, and the folklores and sentiment of the locals - all through a gracious style of writing, with wit and humor in good measure, I must say I also learn from the author much wisdom for getting to know and live with strangers in a strange place. If you have not read this book, you should not wait any longer.
