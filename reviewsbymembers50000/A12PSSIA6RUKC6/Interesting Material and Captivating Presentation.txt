 This book is an excellent journalistic account of Alan Greenspan's life up to the first part of 2000 - the zenith of his career and fame. The book is not a serious biography. You will be disappointed if you expect the book to give you a deep and insightful analysis of Greenspan's life philosophy, his work methodology, or a revelation of the detail working of the Federal Reserve System. On the other hand, this book is a fascinating account of his life - both its private and public sides. Greenspan's brush with band music, his own economic consulting business which employed mostly female economists, his relationship with Ayn Rand and as an esteemed member of her Objectivist Collective, his role and relationship with the Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush and the Clinton teams. There are also some vivid accounts of how he handled some high profile financial and monetary situations as well as how he left his handprints on several important presidential commission reports and recommendations. And, of course, the book has not neglected to give brief but interesting accounts of the women in his life. This book is very well written - the material is interesting and well organized, and presentation is smooth and captivating. I find it to be very enjoyable reading. Read to the end. The last two paragraphs of the book were as weighty as everything written prior!
