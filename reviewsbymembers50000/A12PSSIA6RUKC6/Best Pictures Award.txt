 I am a learning hobbyist artist interested mostly in portraits.  An artist friend told me that I might be interested in the pictures of the Pre-Raphaelites.  "Pre-Ra...What?"   When I bought this book I had not intended to read much of the text.  I was primarily attracted to the beautiful pictures in the book, which I hope to learn from.   It turns out that Christopher Wood's rendition of the biographies of these remarkable group of mid- to late 19th century English artists was exceptionally well weaved and readable.  I got a very good education on the history of the Pre-Rephaelite art with fascinating details of the lives of the key players and, of course, beautiful, large-format reproduction of their best work.   I came across a number of books on this subject.  Some have better and more detail prose, but none comes close to this one in terms selection and the quality of reproduction of the pictures.
