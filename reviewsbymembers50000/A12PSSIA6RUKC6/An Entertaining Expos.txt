 What Bernard Goldberg did-writing about the bias in CBS news in a WSJ op-ed-was something that he felt he had to do.  I think he was right about that.  At some point, a combination of righteousness and frustration would drive a person to the point of desperation wanting to be heard, even at a high cost.  Goldberg did a good job with the op-ed.  He made a valid point.  He pointed out the obvious.  His credentials also provided high-power ammunition to the networks' critics. So, good job Bernie.  Just please don't whine about being put in the dog house.  Not that you deserve to be, but, seriously, what else do you expect?  Bias is mostly a small vendetta on the CBS news operations, specially targeting Dan Rather and Andrew Heyward.  If you enjoy expos by an insider, this book is reasonably good specimen.  It is written with wit and filled with interesting details.  Quite frankly, although the details are interesting-being able to listen to what one is not privy to is always interesting-but none of it is at all surprising.  The media bias is so obvious, so in-your-face, that it needs no one to point out!  What Goldberg has told in this book is entertaining rather than enlightening. I had a couple of enjoyable evening reading this book.
