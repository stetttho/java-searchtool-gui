 This book is one of the best among those in the Dover Art Library.  I really like this book because the selection includes many beautifully executed portraits.  Sargent's style is at once both romantic and incisive.  The portraits are so highly expressive that one is compelled to assume accurate likeness. John Singer Sargent is a great master of portraiture.  This very enjoyable collection does him justice.
