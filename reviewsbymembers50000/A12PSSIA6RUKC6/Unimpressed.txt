 I would never understand why this novel was on the very top of the Modern Library's 100 best novels of all time, on the "Board's List", no less.  I guess it is there because some authority had once said that it was the best.  And once done, nobody dares to contradict the edict, for if you disagree, you are just not seeing the greatness the experts are able to see.  The same way all "educated" opinions say that Munch's Scream and Picasso's Guernica were great art, that Citizen Kane was the best movie ever made, or that the Emperor's new clothes were most beautiful!
