 This book is completely reference oriented.  If you want to learn to write VBscript using this book, you will get nowhere.  I found the first error in the book within 30 minutes.  To be fair, I have not yet found the second one after 10 more hours.  The problem is, with 10 hours of intensive reading and searching, I am not able to figure out how to write a simple script to find a file with a known name and check its last modified date and conditionally delete it.  Many say it has a good reference section.  It may be true, except that a) it is not complete - I found no reference for Subfolder except the container, and b) the examples are plentiful but they are mostly one- or two-liners which show how to use a particular language element, rather than how that element can be employed to solve real life problems.  $23.07 and ten hours.  That's it.  I am cutting my losses.
