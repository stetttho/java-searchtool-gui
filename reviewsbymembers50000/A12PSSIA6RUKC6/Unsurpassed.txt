 This book is a detailed chronicle of Waterhouse's life and many of his important works.  The paintings are lavishly reproduced in large formats. It will satisfy the most demanding reader.   I loaned out this book from a library with the intention of scanning a few good pictures to learn from.  I ended up marking up for scanning dozens of them that were too good to pass up.  So I decide to purchase my own copy of the book instead. If you are artistically oriented, this book will give you hours and hours of enjoyment, and if you spend time to read the text, which is well researched, well written and prodigiously informative, you will as soon become an authority of sorts on J. W. Waterhouse.
