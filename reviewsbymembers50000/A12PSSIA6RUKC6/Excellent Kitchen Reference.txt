 Howard Hillman's "Kitchen Science" and Robert Wolke's "What Einstein Told His Cook" are two books of largely similar information.  Their titles foreshadow their different writing styles. Both are very informative and worthy of keeping as a reference.  Hillman uses a question and answer format and is direct and succinct.  Wolke also uses the question/answer format, but he has more lively style, and the lengthier answers are rendered with much wit and humor.  For the efficiency-mined reader, Hillman's book gives more bang. Wolke's book gives more reading pleasure. Interestingly, they sometimes disagree.  Hillman says that most alcohol added to dishes while cooking is lost due to evaporation, while Wolke maintains, with a more nuanced explanation, that the anywhere from 4 to 49 % of the added alcohol might remain... Take your pick.  I enjoyed both.
