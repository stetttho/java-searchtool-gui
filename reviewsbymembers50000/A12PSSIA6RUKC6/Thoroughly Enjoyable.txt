 P. J. Orourke is hilarious.  He has the unique gift of being able to entertain while writing about a serious subject.  Now of course you cannot take what he writes as a serious thesis, but most certainly you will enjoy reading his book, and learn interesting tidbits through his narration of many of the many places he visited. An interesting experience of reading Orourke is that even though his writings are full of humor and hyperbole, you are never confused about what the facts are.  Another thing is that by scrutinizing what he wrote about one particular place that I happen to know very well, I can say that he captured the essence of the place quite masterfully in a dozen pages or so.  And I feel quite comfortable that he would do a similarly good job for me for the places that I dont know. Orourke offers his insights as he narrates his experience and observations.  They are quite instructive and succinct.  Overall, the few evenings I spend reading his book have been among the most enjoyable and educational ones I have had.
