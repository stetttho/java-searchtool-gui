 This is a good collection of da Vinci's drawings.  It is one of the best among those in the Dover Art Library.  A few of the pictures so vividly captured the instantaneous expressions of men in various emotional states that one is left breathless by da Vinci's incomparable power of observation and stunning drawing skills.  Another bunch of drawings had complicated contents and they all showed amazingly accurate perspective geometry.  One is left with no doubt that the great artist is no less a great scientist. This book, being a collection of drawings, does little to teach, but it is a good reference and a standard of excellence for comparison with other drawings.  I recommend it for any serious art student.
