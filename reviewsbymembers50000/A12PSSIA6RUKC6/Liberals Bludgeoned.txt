 Ann Coulter is not my favorite pundit.  She is given to exaggerations and rather inflammatory rhetoric, not a style I particularly like.  But this book is surprisingly good.  Her hyperbolic style notwithstanding, this book is a well structured for the points she is to make and she proffers an impressive portfolio of evidence and statistics to illustrate and prove those points.  I am impressed with her critical thinking and analysis.  As well I should be, she is an attorney and it shows.  She is amply good at sourcing and presenting evidence to prove her points and does so beyond reasonable doubt. Those points are that the liberals control the media and use it to slander conservative politicians with lies, name-calling, censorship, biased portrayals, and outright attacks while fawning on liberal democrats.  The liberals, Coulter contents, have no respect for the facts and would do anything to win. Needless to say, this book is one-sided, which means that the facts, data, etc., are all selected to support her thesis.  Nonetheless, those who disagree with her seem to choose to attack her person and her motive instead of trying to debate her by proffering counter evidence or noting errors in her book.  Could it be that, as Ann Coulter herself says in the book, that the liberals just can't, because they don't have the facts with them? After reading this book, I am inclined to revise my opinion of her.  Those exaggerations are still there.  But, like a good lawyer, she does her homework very well, and she writes with clarity and force, generous with wit and humor.  Coulter's well-researched accounts left the liberals no place to hide.  "Slander" is both informative and entertaining.
