 I am not a fan of romantic novels, but I really enjoyed reading this book.  The perfect mix of flirtatious romance, exotic scenery and food, and an occasional outpour of tender emotions makes this book refreshingly enticing.  The liberal sprinkling of Italian phrases is a charm rather than a distraction because the author skillfully makes sure that her readers understand the conversation. This is a first person narrative written in a second person style.  It is a bit strange at first, but you get use to it real fast! This is the perfect book for the rainy weekend.  Highly recommended.
