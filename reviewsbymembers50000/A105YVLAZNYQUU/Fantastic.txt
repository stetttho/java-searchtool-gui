 This album smokes! I have no idea how someone can criticize this at all. How long can COC continue to make amazing records while sales continue to dwindle? This album cements them as masters of a genre they alone have created. Every song is freaking amazing and I never get tired of listening to this masterpiece.  Some people have complained and whined that Corrosion of Conformity changed their name to COC. These same people are losers that complain about this album. GET A GRIP clowns - you are the same people that complain how COC used to be `hardcore' or `punk'. COC create music for people with intelligence, that's it - DEAL WITH IT!   This album absolutely smokes! Every song reaffirms the band at the top of their collective skills. Granted, the production is not their best but the songs speak for themselves. I would have preferred that the production was a bit more raw - just like the live cd/dvd. Regardless, then music is something COC alone could craft and nobody in music today comes close to matching these rock monsters.  Bottom line, COC have crafted something amazing once again and the general public are too dumb too notice. The current music scene is garbage so if you truly want something inspired and unique --  buy COC.
