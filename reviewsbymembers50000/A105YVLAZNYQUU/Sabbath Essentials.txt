 What to say about a record that most everyone knows? I'm sure it's the best-selling Sabbath record ever made and pretty much everyone I know has it - even if it's the only Sabbath album they own.  First off, it's not their best work. Super classic `War Pigs' is amazing, as is `Paranoid', `Planet Caravan' and `Hand of Doom'. The rest of the songs work well except for `Iron Man'. Sure the riff is the stuff of legends but I have always hated the song. It is just too goofy - and the story or lyrics are weak.   The cover art is laughable - couldnt they have something better??  Bottom line - you need to own this album. It will change your life for the better.
