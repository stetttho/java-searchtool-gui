 Sometimes good, sometimes great but overall this book is VERY laid back and sort of half baked. Roth writes with a Zen persona - so some stories dont really head anywhere and some anecdotes fade out before they should.  Some of the time it works and certain chapters are funny, informative, and entertaining. Other times the Zen man doesn't deliver the goods.   Overall the book is a must read for fans of classic Van Halen and DLR because there really is nothing else out there. Unfortunately, there is very little insight to the Van Halen machine at he height of their success.  One additional note - my book is completely falling apart. The publishers used some garbage adhesive or something because I have barely touched the book and almost all the pages have come free from the binding. What kind of junk is that!!!??
