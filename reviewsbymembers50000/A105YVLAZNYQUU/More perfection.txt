 What do you do after releasing the best record of the 80's ( Ride the Lightning)? You record an album that maintains the perfection. Puppets is a metal classic, period. Follows the same formula as RTL but remains fresh and new. Permanent godly status ensues.  Best song? Tough to say, because this album is so over the top good, but I have to go with Orion. The second instrumental they recorded, and WAY better than Call of Ktulu ( which for some weird reason is experiencing some kind of resurgence in popularity). Orion is genuis. I dont have an incredible background in classical music - but to me Orion is as good as anything ever written. The power, emotion, and beauty of Orion is second to none - and in fact, it is an even greater song because of the lack of lyrics. Orion is perfection. Without a doubt, Cliff Burton cements himself as a master musician because as we shall soon see - Metallica lose a large part of their innovation and creativity without him. RIP Cliff.
