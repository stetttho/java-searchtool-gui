 Its basically come to this .. a band that was setting standards with metal innovation have fallen behind creatively - and they get rewarded with insane commercial success. So here you have dumb riffs that dont develop and weak songs from start to finish. Put that together with a super-glossy sounding production package and you have the biggest disappointment in music history. This album was created for one reason and one reason alone - sales. If Metallica had retained their integrity, they would have made a real metal album  - not this crap.
