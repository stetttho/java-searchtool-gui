 If you don't like this album, then you are not a real Pantera fan. I read someone complaining that this album is too heavy or something? WTF? Are you insane? If you want lame ass melodies and wimp music then go elsewhere.   This album freaking kicks in you in head the second it begins, and doesn't let up until the last fade out. It is 100% aggression.  All the songs rule and they all have fantastic riffs and vocals. No awful nu-metal crap and no ballads.  Listening to this album makes my heart skip and it makes me want to fight - which is exactly what it should do.  Pantera should be proud of 3 things:  1. Their albums got HEAVIER with each successive release. This is almost unheard of considering how many metal bands sell-out, wimp out or change styles.  2. Pantera leaves a legacy of pure metal, and this last album stands up perhaps the best work of their careers.  3. They never compromised or sold-out. Period.  Sadly, Dimebag is gone but he will always be the soul of one of the most powerful bands to ever exist. RIP Darrell
