 Rushmore is one of those rare movies that you can watch over and over yet continue to find new gems with each viewing. A total slap in the face to the Hollywood block-buster garbage we see every summer -- Rushmore demands more of you. Not for teenagers or dimwits - they wont get it. Bill Murray is amazing and this film is a re-emergence of sorts for the rejuvenated comic genius.
