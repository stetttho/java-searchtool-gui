 What do I say about the album I consider to be the BEST album ever created?? Words do not do this album justice. It is a masterwork of epic proportions.  Perhaps more than anything - this album cements Black Sabbath as pure musical geniuses. They reach down into the very pits of their souls - and summon a work of art so majestic, it defies suitable descriptions.   At its simplest level - this album is unique, powerful, intense, complex - it is everything you could ever hope for from music. It is the amalgamation of four people and their ideas into one collective consciousness. It is beyond simple titles or description. It is not brilliant - rather it is BRILLIANCE.
