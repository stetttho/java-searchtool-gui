 Lets get one thing straight - COC does not sound anything like those losers in Metallica. I have no idea what people are hearing when they compare COC to the Met camp. Put it this way, COC is a class above and beyond. On this album, the tunes are heavy deep southern fried sabbath doom. It a shame that COC is compared to Metallica at all because the sounds are nowhere alike. Comparing the two is ridiculous - and lets me state for the record that COC creates timeless music that somehow seems to be getting better with each album. While Metallica's best days are long past.  Woody delivers a killer performance! Some of the solos are just ridiculous. I cant figure out how that SOUND was achieved. And Mike blows freaking insane grooves over every inch of this record. He is such an amazing bass-player and he never gets the proper respect from the music press.  And finally Pepper. What can you say about this man that people havent heard? The dude is sick man. He just oozes talent and he cements COC as one of the greatest bands there will ever be.  I personally like Deliverance and America's Volume Dealer better but Wiseblood still kicks major ass. Really - this band is without peer. Simply put, if you like Deliverance - you will like this album.
