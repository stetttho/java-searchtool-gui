 The last couple Belladonna albums were getting tired and clich so Anthrax dumps their singer and brings in super dude John Bush ( of Armored Saint fame). The results are impressive to say the least. More riffage, more power, better lyrics, better songwriting - better production, better everything. Put it this way - old Anthrax is for teenagers, new Anthrax is for men.
