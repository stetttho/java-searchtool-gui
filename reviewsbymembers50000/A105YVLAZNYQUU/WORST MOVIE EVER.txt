 Words cannot describe the agony I experienced while watching this piece of crap. I would rather have 10 root canals then see ANY part of this junk again. Not only is the acting, plot, dialogue, and directing horrible - but in the end the whole world is run by a FREAKING DOLPHIN!!! A big plastic looking fake dolphin. I want my money back, I want a letter of apology from anyone even remotely involved with this film, and the executives who green lighted this crap should be fired. I wish I could give it a negative rating. This is THE worst movie I have EVER seen. Anyone who likes this movie must be really high or really dumb.
