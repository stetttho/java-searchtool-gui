 WOW - to date Sabbath created the heaviest 2 albums ever made and you think to yourself - where do they go from here? Well the answer becomes sickeningly obvious soon enough - they create an even more powerful sound and attitude.   Are you kidding me? Right from the first seconds of `Sweet Leaf' - Sabbath show the world they are the innovators of the heaviest sound ever. The first 2 albums were metal and all - but they were blues based and Sabbath was still finding themselves. On this 3rd outing - the heavens opened and out poured the heaviest blobs of doom imaginable.  Pure timeless boundless heaviness. Every second of this album is perfect. Inventors of stoner metal, doom metal, heavy metal  - every metal. Sabbath is beyond the shackles of mankind on this album  - they have progressed to some other-worldy existence of perfection.
