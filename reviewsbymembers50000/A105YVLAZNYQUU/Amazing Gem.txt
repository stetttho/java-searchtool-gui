 As a whole, this album is ultimately not so great. There are a lot of throw-away songs and some goofy spoken stuff. But there are some damn cool songs and moments of genuine inspiration. More than anything though I recommend this album because of 'Boss DJ'. This songs is so good it is hard to put into words. The first time I heard this song I think I hit replay about 20 freaking times. And everytime I hear it now, it takes me to a different place. It is so simple yet so amazing - and it showcases the beauty of Sublime - Brad and his guitar. Damn this song is good!
