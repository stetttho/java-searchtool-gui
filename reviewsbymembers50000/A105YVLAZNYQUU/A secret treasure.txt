 Fast, hardcore, metal, unique: These 4 elements make up the amazing concotion know as Kinghorse. Basically a relentless battery of anger with occasional melodic expressions. I bought this album the month it was released and immediately loved it. Memorable riffs and lyrics with a splash of hardcore make this a metal feast for the ears. I think this album is too intense for most people 'cause everyone I know hates it except me. I still listen to this record when I want something unique to kick me awake. This album puts the current music scene to shame. Sadly, Kinghorse didn't last long enough to make other albums but this record will always be a powerful stab of emotion. Kinghorse is one of the most unique bands I have ever heard.
