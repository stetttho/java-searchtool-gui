 I am not a fan of Anne Rice, I never followed the vampire stories or whatever, but somehow I got my hands on this book and I was completely blown away. This book is basically the authors' interpretation of Western religion. If you are looking for some kind of vampire story then you will be dissapointed. But if you are looking for a unique view of God and the Devil - then read this book today! The book is FICTION people and no one is claiming anything to the contrary. Enjoy the book to that end.
