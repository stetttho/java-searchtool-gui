 My words cannot properly give explanation to this amazing double-album. I have listened to it completely now about 6 times, and each listen brings new favorites and melodies sticking in my head. It's really too much for my mind to understand how these 28 songs are so good. I was worried that a double album would mean one good album's worth of songs with a ton of filler crap.   Thankfully I couldn't be more wrong. It's hard to understand how these guys seemingly get better and better as musicians over the years. Pretty much for 20 years now, every new RHCP album becomes my favorite and this is no exception. These albums bleed integrity and genius and I feel privileged to hear them.   These songs weave into beautiful sounds and powerful melodies. The one thing that absolutely blows me away is how these guys have become masters of melody and chorus. Simply genius and they get better and better at it with each passing album.  The highlights for me are too numerous too mention, but I really enjoy any time John sings backup - his voice is transcendental. John and Flea are virtuosos on their guitars. Anthony has never sounded better, and Chad pounds the skins perfectly. Freaking amazing!  I think I like MARS a bit better but really it might change any given day. These guys are insane talents, and each member brings their A game.   Thankfully this band still makes music and we are all fortunate to be able to enjoy them. Their last tour absolutely blew me away and I can't wait to see them live again this year. This double-album is really so good it is mind numbing.
