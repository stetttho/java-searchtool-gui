 This movie rocks. I love that Jim Carrey is the demented Cable Guy. Jim Carrey ( up till this movie) was only known for 'wacky' - goofy comedy. And this movie is leaps and bounds above that crap. If you want lame - childish - Pet Ventura junk then stay away. But if you can appreciate smart humor and good writing then this is a blast. The whole concept of Cable Guy is based on a man who will do anything to be liked - even though everything he does is over the top and annoying. The two scenes that always kill me: 1) he dresses up like Freddie Mercury and beats up Owen Wilson in the bathroom. 2) He mauls the dude in the basketball game in slo-mo, then eventually dunks the ball and breaks the glass after hanging on the rim and falls STRAIGHT down.
