 Tommy Lee takes us into his mind and world in this entertaining read. The format is fantastic, the stories are cool, and the bottom line is that Tommy comes off looking like a pretty decent guy. Towards the end of the DIRT, Tommy was looking pretty wimpy and weak - but this book dispels that notion pretty quickly.   An emotional ride and very enjoyable to read - in fact I read it in about 5 hrs in one sitting. Definitely recommended
