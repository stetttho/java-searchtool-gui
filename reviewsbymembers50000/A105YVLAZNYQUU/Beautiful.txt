 On one hand the power and emotion of this album destroys all notions of metal or heavy music, and creates a uniqueness not found before. On the other hand the searing lyrics and vocals tear up your mind as you bare witness to the mental anguish of this band. This record is unapologetic with its first hand account of drug abuse and the disarray it creates. However, the songs are unquestionably a success because they are so raw, genuine, and intense.  Anyone who loves heavy music needs to own this album. Some songs are so powerful, you wonder how the sound doesn't tear through your speakers. Seriously, there are some moments in music history that change things forever. Black Sabbath did it with Master of Reality and Alice in Chains does it here.  The first time I heard this album, my brain was obliterated by its intense focus on HEAVY. Not spastic or noise or hardcore - just freaking beautiful. Sweltering guitar, blazing vocals. The emotion of this record is one of those rare achievements in heavy music.    It can and will change your life permanently. RIP Layne.
