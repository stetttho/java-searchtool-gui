 First off I am a HUGE Jay Mohr fan. The dude makes me laugh so hard it's ridiculous. However in my opinion, Jay's comedy works when the interaction is just YOU and HIM. Therefore his stand up routine and radio appearances absolutely KILL.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Jay's acting gigs, and TV roles such as SNL. The SNL environment pretty much isolated Jay from his strengths - improv, impersonations, and feeding off an audience to get laughter. Some SNL brass recognized his talent and gave him a job, but the SNL machine pretty much chewed and spit Jay out. SNL works as a very disorganized hierarchy where the best ideas or talent does not necessarily rise to the top. And Jay flat out did not function within that environment.  Jay provides insight into the SNL machine and how it runs, so you gotta like that. Plus it is well written and easy to read. You could sit down and read this book in one evening for sure.  Anyway, the book is a good read - nothing great or mind blowing, but if you are a fan of Jay or SNL it is a must read!
