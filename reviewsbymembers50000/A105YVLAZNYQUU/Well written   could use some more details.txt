 First off - this book is a must read for fans of Ozzy era Sabbath. But I must admit that I was a bit disappointed with the lack of detail or 'dirt' that was uncovered. For example the book writes something about a night of 'drinking and trouble'. Well I wanna know what happened, who was there, what sex acts were performed etc. Maybe I am expecting too much after reading Motley Crue's 'The Dirt'.   In any event, the book definitely shows that Sabbath were a regular blue-collar bunch who never took themselves too seriously. Some cool photos and cool stories. One comment - Bill Ward quickly goes from looking healthy to looking sickly in the band photos. Man - he needed someone to help him back in the day. He looks like the walking dead or something
