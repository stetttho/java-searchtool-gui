 This album is widely recognized as Sabbath's best work EVER. At various times I have agreed with that sentiment - but finally I have decided that it comes in at number 2 behind Sabotage.   Nevertheless, this album is a life-changing event. Sabbath could have released the title track alone and it would still be considered a classic album. Sabbath holed up in a castle, threw out all previous conventions they created and uniformly created this colossal amount of metal.  Hidden favorite is `Looking For Today' - an overlooked song that embodies the amazing Sabbath in yet another new musical venture.   You need to but this album - from the cover art to the last seconds of play time, you will not be disappointed.
