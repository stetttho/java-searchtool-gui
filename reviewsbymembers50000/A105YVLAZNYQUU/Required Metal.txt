 Sacred Reich are completely underappreciated and overlooked, but they were one of the elite thrash / metal bands of the 80's and 90's. Heal is a fantastic album with everything you could want from a band. The riffs are cool, the lyrics are always up to par and the production rocks. Plus as an added bonus, Phil can actually sing which is a welcome change from today's junk.
