 This is the album that singularly changed my opinion on Pantera. Up to this point I was not really a fan of the band. I bought Cowboys From Hell and I thought `ehhhhh'.  I bought Vulgar Display of Power and was immediately impressed that Pantera was heavier than on CFH. But something didn't quite click for me. Even still - I like Vulgar but I skip through songs and I don't hold it up to this masterpiece.  Far Beyond Driven is freaking tremendous. Dimebag reaches new heights on his riffery - and it's hard to comprehend how good some of these songs are. Phil becomes the man - a screaming, growling entity that lays his mind bare with some of the most intense self-examining lyrics around. Phil stops trying to sing and in doing so, he scream himselfs into one of the best vocalists in metal.   The first time I heard `Shedding Skin' my brain exploded. To this day, that song breeds something primal in me and makes me want to destroy. That's the beauty of Pantera - you cannot deny their power and their energy.    The band simply gels as one complete pulse of metal - and they make it seem easy!
