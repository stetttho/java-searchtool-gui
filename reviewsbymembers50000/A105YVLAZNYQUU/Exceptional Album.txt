 This album is easily in my top ten list of greatest albums ever. Those of you who can't appreciate this album are weak minded fools.  Angel Dust transcends music and song writing. The pure passion and emotion that bleeds from this album makes me understand that music is the ultimate expression of creating art.  This album was a great huge `slack off' to the commercial machine of MTV and radio and for that very reason alone it can be considered genius. FNM's previous album enjoyed way too much mainstream success and the band followed up with an album that reeked of integrity, and pushed the boundaries of music.  Every song is unique, every song is radically amazing. Years later I still marvel at the symphony of sound and power the band created on this majestic album. From the opening power of Land of Sunshine to the final notes of Midnight Cowboy - this album takes you on a passage through all limitations of genre. Every instrument and sound are perfect. Every band member reaches their peak as a continuation of one unique wall of substance.  And the lyrics - unbelievable!!  Pure and simple -  some of the greatest lyrics ever spoken by man.   Mere labels and categories cannot apply to this band nor this album. Is it metal? Is it funk? Is it alternative? These categories are meaningless. It is Angel Dust and nothing less would do.
