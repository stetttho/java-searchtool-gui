 This movie freaking rules! Billy Bob is a mean ass who absolutely hates everything and everyone. Basically the whole movie is a running joke of insults and loathing. Damn funny! One scene keeps coming back to me - Billy Bob " You cant drink worth sh*t!" Midget "I'm 92 pounds you dic$!"  HAHAHAHAAH buy this movie today!
