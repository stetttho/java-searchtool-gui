 Every Ozzy-era Sabbath album sounds different and it's interesting to hear the unique power that Sabbath create for this album.  Vol 4 is in and of itself brilliant. It stands alone as maybe the first `collection' of songs for the Sab Four. The three prior albums had an unspoken theme or feel to the tunes and Vol 4 strays from that comfort zone. Not that this is a bad thing - indeed Vol 4 is simply devastating.  Lose yourself in the mood changes that unfolds with this colossal album. I must admit that `Changes' is weak - not at all a Sab song I enjoy but nevertheless this album is essential.   Basically  - Sabbath moved forward in their metal progression. Once again they show that they alone are capable of creating something so meaningful.
