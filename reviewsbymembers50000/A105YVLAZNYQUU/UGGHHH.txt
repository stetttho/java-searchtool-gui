 Craptacular and boring. The cinematography and special effects are well done but the story is dullsville. And what is up with everyone who is claiming that 'Rudy' is such a great actor? All he did was act tired - WOW give him the Oscar now.   I have no idea why these films or books are so popular... are people that disillusioned with life that they need hobbits and dragons to make themselves feel good? I don't care that it took 25 years or whatever to make these films and Peter Jackson is regarded as a genius. This film is boring and lame - just like the first two movies. And it's also non-sensical, case in point: the flying dragon things and the super tough mean guy were supposedly the toughest, meanest things in the whole world. Well some chick kills the dragon in like 2 seconds and the tough guy in like 3 seconds. WHY? The movie doesn't explain at all how the good guys are suddenly all-powerful and can't be defeated. Anyway I give this movie a 1 because I couldn't care less about some mystical world and some dumb ring.
