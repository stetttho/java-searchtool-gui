 This movie might just be the funniest movie ever made - depending on the day of the week - it is so outright funny, that its hard to believe. Everything about this movie is genius. Bill Murray is amazing - the final 'bowl-off' with Woody defies description - with the comb-over and the 'YES - I AM FINALLY ABOVE THE LAW' and 'Well I didn't want to lose to a guy with a hook' . Woody as Roy Munson is also brilliant. He comes across as the epitome of a man who has been kicked over and over again - but somehow still retains an edge to him. The scene with the landlady is perhaps the greatest laugh you will ever have. Wow! Anyone who doesn't like this movie - must have some sort of brain damage. It isn't Shakespeare people - it is simply a fantastic comedy that centers around ...................BOWLING. Now who would have believed that!?
