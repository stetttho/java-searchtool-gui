 Sacred Reich are so under-appreciated its ridiculous. Although this album is not as fast as some of their other work, it is still amazing. Amazing riffs, fantastic vocals and cool lyrics. Having teamed up with Dave Jerden - the production on this album is fantastic too. Put it this way - if you like Nuclear Assault, Death Angel, Testament, Overkill, Metal Church, Exodus....then you will LOVE Sacred Reich and this is a great album. Sacred Reich is leaps and bounds above the bands I just mentioned yet for some bizarre reason - they never get/got the same recognition.
