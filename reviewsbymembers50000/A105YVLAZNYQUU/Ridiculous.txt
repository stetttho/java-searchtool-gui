 Creepy movie for sure but not creepy enough... The film begins out with promise and then falls apart miserably in the final 1/3 of the movie. The ridiculous sub-plot with Danny Glover was embarassing to watch. The 'who dunnit' becomes weak and fails as the writers seemingly ran out of ideas and just slapped together some mess of an ending. At times there was good suspense and some scenes were scary - but in the end, the film falls short of its goal.
