 A great Christmas movie. Elf works because Will Farrell is a comedy genius, and the story is just different enough to create a feel-good experience. Elf is not going to win any awards or probably even show up on any Best Movie lists - but if you are looking for a good holiday movie with some laughs then Elf is your best bet in years. Also this is a great movie for kids. In fact I think the target audience is kids as there are no adult-jokes that come to mind at all.
