 Sabbath's last studio album w/ Ozzy and the end of genius. This album can be summed up as majestic, emotional, and inspiring. If you like Sabbath you will love this album. Sabbath never compromised their integrity and this album is testament to that. If you are looking for another Paranoid or Master of Reality, you will be disappointed. But the songwriting on this album stands up to any record Sabbath made.
