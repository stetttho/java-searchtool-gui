 I was apprehensive about this CD because solo projects from members of established bands just don't work. However this record proved me wrong. Be warned though, this record is really mellow - like melt in a bong haze mellow. On first listen, about 3 or 4 songs standout so immediately there is some substance to draw you in - then before you know it, the other songs are stuck on your brain. Jerry Cantrell has crafted a fantastic record that provides a soundscape of melody. If you are looking for heavy Alice in Chains you will be disappointed. But if you enjoyed SAP and Jar of Flies - then this record is a natural progression with more arrangements and instruments. Cantrell has a great voice but I do have to confess that on some of these songs, I was wishing for Layne Staley's amazing vocals. RIP Layne
