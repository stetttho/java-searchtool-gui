 This is it folks - the very first HEAVY METAL album in history. Some absolute perennial classics here - my favorites being Behind the Wall of Sleep and N.I.B. ( which is just NIB - as in a pen nib - Bill Wards nickname - not some acronym as per urban myth).  Metal start here - begin the journey with the originators of the genre. Not their best album but a giant kick in the head to the music industry at the time - and a great first record.
