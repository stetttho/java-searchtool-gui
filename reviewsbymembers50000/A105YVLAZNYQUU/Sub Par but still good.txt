 Of all the Ozzy-era Sab albums, I like this one the least. I guess I struggle with where these songs are going - I mean their last album 'Sabotage' was unequivocal genius and somehow they write this as a follow-up?  Some of the songs work - `You Won't Change Me', `All Moving Parts (Stand Still)', `She's Gone', `Dirty Women'.   One of the songs has a cool riff section but quickly changes tempo and arrangement to something bad (Gypsy).   Two songs are awful - `Back Street Kids', `Rock & Roll Doctor'  And the piano ballad is something akin to a Paul McCartney homage (It's Alright) - so you might like it but I just don't see it as Sabbath.  Overall, the record is still strong songwriting - but it finally shows that Sabbath are human after all. Up till now, they kept making greater and greater albums but with this one the slide backwards.  On a plus side - the production on Ozzy's vocals is freaking amazing. Arguably the sickest vocals he ever recorded.
