 This album takes you on a journey, expands your mind, and makes you realize that COC are one of the greatest bands that have ever existed. While other bands have struggled with their identity, their music and their integrity, COC have consistently put out amazing records for the past 14 years. Don't get me wrong, the 80's discs are good in their own right - but COC did not become epic until Pepper joined the band.  Every track is amazing - and don't expect to be bludgeoned into submission with some kind of ridiculous Nu-Metal garbage. COC delivers music that is timeless. It doesn't matter what year this album was made - it will always sound like COC and it will always sound incredible. How many other bands can say that? And its not like the band stays stagnant with this record, in fact this album pushes their music all over the place.   Woody, Mike, and Pepper are freaking amazing! I can't understand how they don't receive more appreciation and sales. Bonus info: I saw their tour w/ Motorhead and they blew me away. Woody is the most-underappreciated guitarists in metal today. His solo work and tone is unreal!  Mike was absolutely killer and Pepper is one the coolest singer/guitarists of all time.  The bottom line is that COC is absolutely one of the greatest bands around. If you don't like COC or this album, you are ignorant.
