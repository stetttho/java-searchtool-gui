 I recently had a discussion in which I was asked what one CD or double CD I can't live without. This is the one I came up with. There is just so much musical genius in this set, from the classic "Piano Man", the  tender "Just The Way You Are", the nostalgic "Goodnight  Saigon" to my personal favorite "Scenes From An Italian  Resteraunt". And talk about issues, there's love, the trauma of  Vietnam, the evil of vanity, the fancy of reckless youth, questionig of  Catholic belief, despair, anddisillusionment, and the pressure of living...  who can't find somethng to relate to in this stuff? If you love Billy Joel  and you can't afford to get all of his albums, or you simply want the best  of what he has to offer, this is the only one you need!
