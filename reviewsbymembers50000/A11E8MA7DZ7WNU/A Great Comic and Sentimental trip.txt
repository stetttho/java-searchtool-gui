 I think Toy Story 2 is better than the 1st. The animation is even more realistic and lively. It's the story though, that truly astounded me. It is sentimental and funny.I think everyone has had a favorite toy and as we come of age, we lose interest in it. While I certainly don't believe toys have feelings, the story can be transcended into reality. The toys can be symbolic of a best friend from childhood, and with the way the world is today, it is easy to grow apart as we grow up. Someday we may go back to find that friend and become tied to them again, and sometimes we just have to let them go and know that they will be best friends with someone else. I believe that this is the true heart of this movie.While this is certainly a great movie for kids, adults like me, will certainly find the humor and entertainment value in it as well.
