 I have been on a weight loss program for about 2 months and bought this book because I thought it would give me some inspiration. Although Ms Molnar's story is inspirational, there isn't enough of it to make it  worthwhile for someone who just wants motivation. However, if you are  just begining and don't know how to go about setting up a diet and exercie  plan, this book will give you some great ideas.  The one feature I did  enjoy was the reference section which lists web sites that will help you  find events such as bike races, walks, and runs in your area.
