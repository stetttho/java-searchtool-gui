 Sentimental, catchy, fun and inspiring are some of the words that come to mind when I think of this album. This is Garth at his best. Unlike some of is previous releases this one has a lot more country to it, which I  appreciate. There's still some of the rock edge, but overall I like the  feel of this CD. Longneck Bottle, In Another's Eyes, and She's Gonna Make  It are the best of this CD.
