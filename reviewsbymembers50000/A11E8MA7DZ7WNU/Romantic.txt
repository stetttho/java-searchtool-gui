 I am a Julia Roberts fan, but not particularly a Hugh Grant fan. In this film, he is totally charming and sweet, very similar to his character in "Four Weddings and a Funeral". Julia Roberts carries herself with  ease in a role that I am sure is very similar to her own life. The  supporting cast of characters was stupendous - they're rough and tumble,  yet totally loveable. I recommend you see this film, just make sure you  have someone to cuddle up with!
