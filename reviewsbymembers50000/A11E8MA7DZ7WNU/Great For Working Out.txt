 I bought this item to protect my iPod while I work out. I have read many reviews of the Apple armband and I happy to report this is a far superior product. I have worn it on the treadmill, bike, and elliptical machine at the gym and my iPod is very secure. The band repels sweat and provides the protection I was seeking. The armband itself is very comfy and easy to adjust, just don't put it on too tight or you'll end up with an irritated arm. (As I found out the first time I used it) I would recommend this product to anyone!
