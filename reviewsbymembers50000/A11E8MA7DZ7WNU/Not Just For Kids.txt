 This is a film that I really relate to. I was not popular in high school and was teased when the "in crowd" found out I liked one of the football players in their group. Although there are some scenes which seem  outlandish, for the most part, the film is an accurate portrayl of the  cruelty which is a part of high school, and how every girl just wants to be  accepted and popular. Barrymore's character is especially poignant when she  mentons how in the real world, no one cares if you were a nerd or a prom  queen, and she adequately expresses that there needs to be understanding  and kindness for everyone.Another important theme in the film is that  sometimes ethics and morality need to come before "getting the  scoop." If only all journalists felt that way, the world would be much  better off.Yes this does appeal to teenagers and there are important issues  for them in it, but adults would do well to visit those issues as well, and  be entertained in the process.
