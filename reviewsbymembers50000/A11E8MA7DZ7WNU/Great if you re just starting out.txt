 My fiance and I are just starting out and needed a decent set of knives to last until we can afford something nicer. We saw this set on sale and scooped it up. It has all of the basic knives needed in your kitchen. Yes, the knives are serrated and the knives are not forged, but for the price, this was an excellent buy!
