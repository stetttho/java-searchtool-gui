 I recently bought this CD and I am happy to report that I wasn't disappointed. I found some beautiful music which I hope to use in my October 2003 wedding ceremony. I think there are some other Christian songs out there that would have been appropriate for this CD, but overall I would have to say this is a beautiful album and would reccommend it to anyone who is looking for inspirational music for their wedding.
