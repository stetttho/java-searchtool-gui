 This is not like other Adam Sandler films. This story has a real heart to it. Sandler is great playing Sonny, a child in a man's body who takes over care of a young child and learns the need for responsability and patience.  There are a few of the typical Sandler sophomoric gags, such as the whole  premise of his character's interaction with a foreign delivery guy, but I  think people who are not normally big on Adam's movies will find some  endearing traits to this flick.
