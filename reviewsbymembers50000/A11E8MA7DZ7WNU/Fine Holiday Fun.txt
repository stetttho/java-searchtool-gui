 This is a sweet, funny, and entertaining movie. There is no deep moral substance here, however, it is hip and fun. Alicia Silverstone is perfectly cast as Cher, adored by boys, and envied by girls outside of her social  circles. When it comes to love, Cher is totally clueless.  Paul Rudd is  charming as Josh, Cher's unlikely dream boy.
