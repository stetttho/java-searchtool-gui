 I related very much to this story. I grew up Catholic and I was always the likeable but not stunning girl. This is truly a movie for anyone who ever loved someone they thougt was out of reach. Chris O' Donell is great as the  loveable, charming, but human Jack, who sees the beauty within Minnie  Driver's sweet, tough, but vulnerable Benny The book is a bit better but  this movie is pretty close.
