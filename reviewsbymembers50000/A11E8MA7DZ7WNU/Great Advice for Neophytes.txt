 I am a new screenwriter and having never studied the art, I wanted to find a book that would help me get started. This book is the total solution. The writers provide examples using films nearly everyone has seen to illustrate their points. The book is easy to read and all subjects are covered thoroughly, from how to start the idea process, to the correct structure of a screenplay, to how to sell it once it is written. I would recommend this book to any and all new writers.
