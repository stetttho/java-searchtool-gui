 I am 24 years old, and I got this for Christmas last year. Itbrought me back to when I used to read the books in elementaryschool. The best part is that all of the stories I remember are in here. The book has beautiful color illustrations and a nice fabric bookmark attached to the book. Not only are the stories great, so is the presentation. I plan to hold on to it and pass it down to my future children. A great gift idea for Winnie the Pooh Fans of any age, and children who will receive a treasure to pass along for generataions!
