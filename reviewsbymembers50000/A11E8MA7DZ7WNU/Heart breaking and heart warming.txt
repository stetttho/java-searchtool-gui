 I will start off by saying this is not the most well written book. However, what it lacks in style, it more than makes up for with honesty and heart. This is a book that shows all of the anguish, and hope that has come  from this story. After reading this, you will believe that Travis Roy is  one of the strongest and most inspiring people you could ever know  of. The best part about this book is that Travis freely expressed  himself. He was unafraid to show his dispair, his grief, his desire, and  his heart. I feel that element makes this different from any other similar  story out there.  There were parts where I laughed and parts where I  cried. This book made a big impact on me because I was there when Travis  has his accident and I saw how the school got together as a community to  support him, something which was rare for such a large and varied  institution of people. I higly recommend this book to any sports fan,  hockey fan, or anyone who just needs a little inspiration in their life.
