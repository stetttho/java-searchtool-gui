 Mr Deeds is Adam Sandler as we know and love him. It's got some hilarious one-liners that you'll be repeating for days to come and there is the usual funny and outragous cast of sidekicks to help our hero on his way. (I especially like "Crazy Eyes" ) This isn't a deep philospophical movie but it is sweet and has a good theme. A must see for people who love Adam Sandler.
