 Well, let me say that I might be a tiny bit biased in this review simply because Chris O'Donnell is just so cute.... but enough of my gushing! This is an adoreable film. Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zelwegger have great  chemistry as a scared, emotionally unavailable bachelor and his spunky,  tough, but loving girlfriend, respectively. They are believeable as a  couple, which is essential to a good romance. The story is predictable, but  none the less, enjoyable and funny. Brooke Shields is hysterical as one of  O'Donnell's ex-girfriends who ponders marriage for the chance of inheriting  a fortune. The film gives an adequate portrayl of the male mind, and how  most men feel in regards to marriage. Overall, it is worth viewing and I  highly recommend it to brides to be who are looking for films to watch with  the girls at a sleepover or bachelorette party!
