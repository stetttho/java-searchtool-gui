 When I first went to see this movie, I wan't sure if I would like it.. I mean, the idea of a man who is blowing the whistle on the cigarette industry seemed a bit dry and far fetched to me. However, I was very  pleasantly surprised and I thoroughly believe this is the best film of  1999. Russell Crowe is nothing short of phenomenal as Jeffrey Wigand. To  think that hunk of a man turned himself into an overweight, middle aged  business man fascinates me. Pacino was terrific as well. I felt it was  his strongest performance since "Scent of a Woman".  Now for  the story, well, it is throughly intriguing. It is suspenseful and really  draws you into the characters, the events, and the whole reality of it.   The Insider is well written and well acted and definitely worth viewing.
