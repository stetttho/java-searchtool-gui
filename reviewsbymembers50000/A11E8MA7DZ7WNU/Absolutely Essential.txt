 I actually won my TIVO as part of a radio promotion, howvever now after having it for over a year I don't know how I lived without it! It is absolutely essential for anyone who has a life..you will inevitably miss your favorite shows and specials without it. It is easy to use. The remote control is easy to read and use. The menus are easy to use and helpful.  Even if you were never able to set a VCR, you could easily use Tivo!  I am a very satisfied customer!
