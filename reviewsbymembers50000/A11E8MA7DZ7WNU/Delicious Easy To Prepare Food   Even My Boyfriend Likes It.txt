 I happened upon this book and thought I'd give it a shot. That was a year ago and I still use it a few times a week. The food is normal and delicious! My boyfriend loved almost everything I made from this book  because it's stuff you would normally make. There are a few new things you  will probably want to try, but also, if you have a favorite meal such as  chicken cacciatore, beef stroganoff, or cheesecake this book has the recipe  and shows you how to make it healthful and still delicious. I use the  weight watchers points system and had no trouble converting recipes. It  also gives exchange, fat and calorie values for dieters who use a different  program. I highly recommend it! It's worth it!
