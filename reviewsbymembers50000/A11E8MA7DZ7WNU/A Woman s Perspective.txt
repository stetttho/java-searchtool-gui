 Well, if you like Ben Affleck this flick will give you ample opportunity to drool and gush because it has plenty of beefcake hero action.I found the story to be good, but not great.. this is certainly not a thinking movie...but I was entertained and I liked the interaction and relationships established in the film. The action was good..the beginninng sequence with the meteor shower was probaby the most enthralling and technical scene. I reccomend Armageddon greatly!
