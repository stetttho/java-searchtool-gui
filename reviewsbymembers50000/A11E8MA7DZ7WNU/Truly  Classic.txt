 This CD has it all! Patty's latest and greatest are all present from the rip roarin' "Can't Get Enough" to the tender "My Kind of Woman / My Kind of Man" (With Vince Gill) Patty has one of the most  haunting and melodic voices in country music and this is the perfect album  for a new fan who wants a solid collection of her hits,or a fan who just  wants her best.
