 Despite what some people feel for this movie, it is, in fact, a realistic look at love. I understand that it would be easy to distinguish this film as  unrealistic because of the confusion a couple of the character's have  with their sexual identieties. But the basics of the film can be appied to  any relationship. The basic principle is "no one before THE ONE  matters!" Thats it, plain and simple. No experiences you have had  before meeting the love of your life, amount to anything once you are with  your soulmate. This film also demonstrates another principal of  relationships, being that we shouldn't listen to what others say or think.  I think many of us have let outside influences get in the way of what could  have been a great relationship. All in all this is a great film if you get  to the heart of the matter. This is a real film, no hi tech anything, and  no fluff, just an honest look at love in today's society.
