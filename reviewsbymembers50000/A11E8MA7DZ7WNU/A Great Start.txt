 I bought this video to get a jump on my weight loss. It has a slow and controlable pace which makes it great for beginners to intermediates. Denise is motivating, speakig to the camera as if she were really your  personal trainer. I find this video especially helpful for legs and arms,  but it does give a complete body workout and promises resuts in 6 weeks,  but I think you will feel better and tighter in just a week. I highly  recommend this video.
