 I just happened to think of this movie the other night. Like a previous critic I remember watching it endlessly on HBO and singing all the songs. I hope the distributor reads this.... a lot of us want this movie! It's a  little corny but what the heck, its fun, happy, and romantic..what's better  than that? =)
