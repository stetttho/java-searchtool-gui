 I am a woman, and yes I love hockey, and yes I love this movie. The cast is made up of loveable and endearing characters, not the least of which is Russell Crowe, who love hockey so much they play every weekend on their  small home pond. Crowe gives a strong performance as the elder statesman of  the group whose position on the team is threatened when a former resident  (Hank Azaria) returns to stage a challenge of the Mystery, Alskan team  agains tthe New York Rangers. All the while, Crowe is left feeling  vulnerable because of the success Azaria's character has acheived, and he  wonders if his wife longs for her former love.  Burt Reynolds is great as  a former hockey coach who refuses to help coach the Mystery team because of  personal issues. If you love hockey you will love this movie. It's  charming, inspiring, and entertaining.
