 I LOVED this movie and was fortunate to have Santa bring it to me for Christmas. Gwyneth Paltrow was excellent, but it was Joseph Fiennes who stole the spotlight as the passionate Shakespeare who leaves his wandering  ways to spend a few days with the love of his life. I wish it had a happier  ending, but love sometimes happens like that. The humor was excellent as  long as you understand it... I like when a movie makes you think about how  funny it is. Overall I'd have to say this is one of my top ten favorites of  the nineties!
