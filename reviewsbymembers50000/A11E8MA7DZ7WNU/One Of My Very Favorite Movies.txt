 I LOVE this movie. It was the first vdeo I ever bought for myself and is one of the sweetest, most romantic, and funniest movies I've seen. DB Sweeney is gorgeous as the loveable, girl chasing,less than brilliant  ex-hockey god, and Moira Kelly plays an excellent, evil, spoiled typical  rich primadonna figure skater from Connecticut. Techncally, it is hard to  believe a hockey player could be transformed into a figure skater, but view  it with an open mind and you will fall in love with this movie too!
