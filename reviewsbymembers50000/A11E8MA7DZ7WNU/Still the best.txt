 I was just a lttle kid when these films came out, but even then, they had a huge impact on my life. I knew I was a part of a cultural phenomenon. Nothing has changed as an adult, except that I am more aware of their impact on society. The stories of the Star Wars trilogy are humorous, fanciful, and compelling. You can not help but be spell bound while watching these films. And despite what many believe, you do not have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy them.Everything you could want is included: romance, drama, heroric battle, humor... it's just an adrenaline rush to watch these movies. You will love it... they are still the best... Phantom Menace was excellent, but nothing will compare to thes three masterful epics!
