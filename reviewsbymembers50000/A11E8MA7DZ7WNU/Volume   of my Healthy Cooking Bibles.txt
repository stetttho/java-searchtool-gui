 I bought this book after buying All-American Low-Fat and No-Fat Recipes by the same author. I am happy to say the results are just as delicious!!There are so many great recipes in this book. Some of my favoirtes are Chicken Breasts Stuffed with Veggies and Cheese, Pizza Cups, Cheeseburger Pie, and the Veg-All Seven Vegetable Mushroom Rice. The book is light on desserts, but on the up side there is an extensive salad and bread section. This book is invaluable to anyone with a busy lifestyle where a quck meal is essential and a healthy meal is desired. Well worth the cost!
