 I have been doing this workout for only a few weeks and I have already noticed a loss of inches around my waist and a tighter butt and firmer legs.The best part of the video is that Kathy goes over proper tecnique  extensively to help minimize injury. Also, the abs and thighs sections are  seperated into three levels for each so that you can work at your own level  and can alternate your routine.If you want a targeted routine where you can  really feel and see the results you want, this is for you.
