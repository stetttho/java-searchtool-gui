 Unlike other reviewers I wasn't a bit annoyed withthe talking in the video. I have other tapes which are MUCH more annoying. Anyway, the first time you try it out it might take a little work, but after a few gos, it  will be fun and easy. The second workout is simpler than the first, mainly  because it breaks down ito four seperate routines. I liked how the second  workout allows you take it up a notch if you so desire. It's low impact and  easy on the knees. Overall fun and quick if you have the initative to spare  twenty minutes.
