 When you throw together a decent plot formula, high quality slick animation, Blue Man Group on music, a fine stable of voice actors, and, well, probably tons of funds, I'd expect to see a very entertaining movie. And while Robots is certainly entertaining, it never ratchets itself up into the land of four stars.  The natural comparison is Monsters, Inc., which I still pull out every so often (more often now that I have an 18 month old daughter). Sections of Robots are filled with the same sorts of allusions that generate an chuckle at the cleverness of the creators. That cleverness, however, overloads the movie, and feels too intentional ("Wouldn't it be clever if we..."), instead of giving additional levels of amusement.  The cast of characters is, also, I think a bit too large for total enjoyment on a first viewing, as I was too busy trying to keep track of people, not knowing how significant they were going to be.  And all that, the cleverness and the number of characters, and the clear amount of thought and energy that went into this makes me think I'm going to watch it again, and probably even enjoy it more the second time around.  Maybe I should have given it four stars after all.
