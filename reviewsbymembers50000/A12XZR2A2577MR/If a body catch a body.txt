 As one of the "great books", and one that a former consumer I worked with listed as her favorite, I felt a certain obligation to read <em>Catcher</em>, at least once. Alienation?  You betcha. Amazing insight on the part of the Narrator?  No. Interesting insight on the part of the author, into cynical teenage angst?  Somewhat. I didn't particularly enjoy reading Catcher, nor did I see, at the time, what the "greatness" that was supposed to be mined from the pages.  Reflecting on it now I can begin to see a little of it.  Perhaps this is one of those books that was meant to be read and discussed as a group, rather than consumed in a solitary mode.
