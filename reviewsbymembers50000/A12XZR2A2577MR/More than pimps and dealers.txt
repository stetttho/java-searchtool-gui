 I picked up CB: FoS to help round out a character I was playing in a Vampire LARP, in large part because I had never actually tried to play a real Settite before.  All clans are hobbled by excessive stereotyping, but the infrequency of the minor clans and bloodlines makes such stereotypes even more difficult to break out of successfully.  The Clanbook helps bust through the "traditional" view of the Followers of Set, barely even mentioning the base pandering that most people would associate with the Clan. The Revised V:tM books as a whole are a major improvement over the stumbling in first and second edition, and this clanbook is no exception.  An updated Path, while less strenuous in it's hierarchy of sins than some, gives much more character to the Followers of Set, while a review of history and pre-history of the world through the eyes of the cult provides a depth that suits so ancient a following. The updating of the dogma of the Followers of Set does a great job of transforming them from a group of fundamentalists into a vital if dark religion.  The style of writing also keeps the message fluid enough that one finds it hard to get locked in to a single interpretation of the message of the Followers of Set, empahiszing once again that their faith is one to be experienced, not simply one of words. What I would have liked to see more of: examples of the founding of a temple more on akhu and specific ritualistic practices
