 That's how my partner referred to John Edwards, sarcasm apparent in her voice, after reading this book.  This is very much a character piece, designed to give a feel for Edwards as a person, rather than Edwards as a candidate.  Short on policy, longer on "I care about justice for the people working to get by." Unless you're already an Edwards fan and want to learn more about your idol, or have an interest in product liability and medical malpractice civil suits, pass on this one.
