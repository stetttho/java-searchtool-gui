 <em>Lullaby</em> is a story of memes, infectious fragments of mental code that ride minds like genes ride cells.  And not only do they ride, they influence action, seeking to spread themselves further.  Carl Streator is both a professional producer of memes, a journalist, and a person who abhors being imposed on through them by constant noise and sonic stimulation, the pollution of our age. Palahniuk takes the idea of memes one step further to make the premise of the novel, by coming up with the thought that kills, the culling song or lullaby which enters Streator's life and leads him to find others whose lives it has touched.  Helen Boyle, real-estate agent and purveyor of haunted houses.  And, as befits a man who hates the pollution of noise and thought fragments of today, he resolves to remove this one, the culling song, from the meme-pool. As a lover of <em>Fight Club</em> in print and on the screen, I was eager to read something else by Palahniuk.  Unlike <em>Fight Club</em>, however, I didn't find <em>Lullaby</em> particularly engaging to read, or to have an enjoyable story on the surface level.  Palahniuk's spare and direct prose didn't do enough for me in terms of giving life to his characters.   On other levels, there's quite a lot to digest, from how he views memes to the changing moments of his characters, and I'm still letting my own thoughts about the meanings and memes in the book percolate, which is a good sign.  I can understand how people might opt to put it down, however, or were totally disappointed by the lack of an enjoyable outer story. So if you want to get infected by the thoughts within <em>Lullaby</em> and you want to give a few hours to absorb the book before you get much out of it, you'll find a <strong>lot</strong> of stimulation.  Otherwise, stay away.
