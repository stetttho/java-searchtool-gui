 A Call to Service is written at a very basic reading level, and outlines Kerry's agenda for reforming the national economic policy (trade, taxes, job creation, balancing the budget), healthcare system, school system, international relations, and energy & environmental policy. The theme of the book is around the call to service, and recreating citizenship as a participatory ideal, not a consumer oriented one. There's nothing earthshattering in the book, though he does make some concrete policy proposals in understandable language. He repeatedly invokes John McCain and Bill Clinton, alludes to Kennedy, and chastises Bush & Cheney. Overall, unless you want to make a campaign contribution, you'll find much more information on Kerry's campaign website.
