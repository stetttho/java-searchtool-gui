 I just finished reading Lies an hour or so ago, sneaking in chapters here or there, and I have to say that it has provided some of the best laughs I've had in several weeks, from the outright funny sort of laughs to the "I have to laugh, otherwise I'me going to cry from the absurdity" sort of laughs. What Lies is is a look at hypocrisy, over-simplification, and deceit that current neo-cons get away with in the media.  I'm certain an equally detailed book could be written from the other side, though probably not nearly so laugh evoking. Is this a great piece of investigative journalism, a concentrated expos, or anything of the sort?  No, and if you wanted that you'd be reading a variety of other lie-busting sources.  Try Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) or other places for leads. Is this book going to convert many people?  I hope not, as converts tend to lack on the skepticism front.  Rather I hope it provokes good-humored skepticism that will help challenge the current administration, as well as those in the future, and the records of those in the past.  Unlike Franken, I bear no love for the president that "ended welfare as we know it", or under whose watch Enron and MCI/Worldcom developed.
