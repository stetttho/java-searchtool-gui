 With her novelization of the life of a freewoman who made the terrible choice to leave one of her children behind in claiming freedom for herself and two other children, Lorene Cary takes us into a vivid land of history and humanity in pre-war Philadelphia.  As a modern novel, <em>Price</em> is not only accessible, it provides engaging characters and a resonant story. First and foremost, <em>Price</em> is the tale of Virginia (Ginnie), now named Mercer Gray, and her transition from slavery to vigilant freedom.  Cary takes Mercer through a very human path, with attempts to reconcile her desires for freedom, self-sufficiency and some kind of comfort or security, with the costs of that freedom and her duty to both those that have helped her and the price that she paid for her freedom.  The Quick family, a multigenerational mesh of survivors and hangers on, gives a rich field for Mercer to grow in. <em>Price</em> stands as complement to the slavery-era narratives from which it draws.  Written in a more modern English, and with the liberty to have been crafted for drama as well as truth, <em>Price</em> could very easily serve as an introduction to a genre of historical literature that can be daunting for both its content and language.  Cary also has the liberty to go further into the awkward or accusatory truths that free black people of the era may have often self-censored for fear of alienating their supporters. Chosen as the key book for the One Book, One Philadelphia project, Cary's work has the kind of Easter Eggs familiar to those who personally know where a book is set.  Cary's early years and childhood in Philadelphia, and current residence here, provide another tie for the city to give back some Love. Overall an excellent book.
