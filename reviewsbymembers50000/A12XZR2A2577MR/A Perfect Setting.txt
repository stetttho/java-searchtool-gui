 I just finished watching The Others, a movie that had been sitting on my shelf, borrowed from my parents collection, since around the time of Thanksgiving.  The sky outside was overcast, the lights all off in the apartment, leaving enough grey illumination to see by.  The chill of the tail end of winter permeates the house, convincing me to pull myself under a blanket, and the cats have chosen to sleep.  This, I imagine, has to have been one of the perfect settings in which to watch The Others. Without anyone else around, your breath matches to that of the characters on screen, and you get wrapped up in the tightly ritualized life in the house of Grace (Kidman) and her two children, Anne and Nicolas.  The entire family has been stricken by the bizarre allergy to sunlight, although it is only the children that are directly injured by the rays. The movie develops at its own pace, a slow patterning as new layers are added to the mystery, and new inklings of terror are hinted at.  It is a movie to be watched when one in unconcerned about time in the real world, so that one can fall into the pendulum of the film's own cadence. Excellent.
