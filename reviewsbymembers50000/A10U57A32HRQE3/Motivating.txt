 The most motivating woodworking book I own. I bought this book to help with a couple of things I wanted to do around the house. I now have several routers and just can't stop building ... well things. Even when another tool will be more efficient I prefer the router, althought this doesn't keep me from building up my shop. If I could only send the authors my tool bills since purchasing this book (my wife despises the authors). I am a novice and my advice on the breadth and quality of techniques taught in this book should be taken lightly but so far I have been able to do all the techniques taught. They are clearly written and easy to understand. My skills have increased a thousand fold since reading this book, if not because of the information contained in the book certainly because of the motivation contained within.
