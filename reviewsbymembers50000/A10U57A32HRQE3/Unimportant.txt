 I call myself centrist because I have views from both sides of the aisle. From this view point all I see is two sides yelling at each other at the top of their lungs, eyes and ears shut tight.  I do wonder if the author would have called those concerned with our treatment of Japanese Americans during WWII traitors. I think both extremes of American Politics love their country and both extremes find the other repulsive. Indeed both sides probably think the other are traitors and from their views they may be. From the center I find this book somewhat humorous at least in the response it illicits from the two extremes. From the center this book just does not seem all that important.  Its basic premise seems to lack any real intelligence unless you are as far right as Miss Coulter or maybe far left judging by the  response. The book does seem to push for an ideological hate similar to those that allowed for the persecution of faiths antithetical to those in power. It seems equaled only by those directly apposed. It is only that hate coupled with fervent support that gives a book like this any power. Take it as an intersting read at least in its commentary on the state of affairs between the two extremes of American politics if not its content.
