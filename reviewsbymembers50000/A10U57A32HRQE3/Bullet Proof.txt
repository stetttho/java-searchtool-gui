 I have used this sander in many ways it was not intended. Abuse after abuse it keeps running. I would have given it four stars because the dust bag is somewhat cheap and does not attach properly but then I dropped it 2 stories on to a paved driveway. Not even a dent. Up to five stars. I have used it non stop for hours. I should have bought more sander for the tasks but it was there and I needed a sander. When I do finally get a random orbital sander I will get another DeWalt.
