 As a long time user of several versions of Dreamweaver and UltraDev I found this book useless for advanced and even intermediate topics. If you are an advanced user SKIP this book. I was very dissapointed with the book and found the title misleading. It should be HOW TO DO A LITTLE BIT WITH DREAMWEAVER MX. On the other hand, anything basic I needed to relearn for MX was easy to find and easily understandable. If you are just starting out with Dreamweaver MX it is a solid consideration as far as I can tell.
