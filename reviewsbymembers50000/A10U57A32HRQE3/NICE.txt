 The best computer book I have every used. While that in itself is barely a compliment I have found this book incredibly useful and easy to understand. I almost never read computer books cover to cover but use them as a reference. While this book is a tutorial best followed front to back I find it easy to use as a reference. It is not hard to jump in right in the middle of chapter and pick up what is being taught. I bought the book sight unseen in the hopes of learning 6 specific things. In only a week I have found that everything I wanted is either covered or provides enough background to use more advanced texts. Not an advanced book but for those that learn like me (jump in, start writing code and figure it out as you go) this book is fantastic.
