 The sound is great and the display is awesome. Usability is fine. As for the software... Unless you register with sony and have an online account with them you can only use one computer to put music on the player. So much for work (my business - my computers), my laptop and my home office computer. I am sending it back. If this does not bother you I would give it five stars.
