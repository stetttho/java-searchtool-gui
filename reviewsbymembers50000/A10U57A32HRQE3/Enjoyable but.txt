 I really enjoyed the historical review and even the partial diatribes on the importance of our business leaders and their importance to society. I read this book in one sitting and would buy it again but "Learn to Earn" seems misleading.  I found little useful information for investing. I consider myself a novice at investing but this book offered nothing to really make me a better invester that I did not already know. One reviewer said that the useful investing information could be summed up in 3 or 4 pages. I agree if you want to reduce this book to a text book of investing but don't discard the other information presented. I found it very interesting at the least but more likely useful historical perspective that can affect the way I invest. If you want a more pure book on investing there are books like The Warren Buffet Way and even more text-book-like ones out there. This is a good soft core book of investing that is an enjoyable read. I recommend it.
