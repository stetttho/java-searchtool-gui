 As a novice woodworker I find this book heads me in the right direction but does not take me there. It covers a lot of topics breifly without trying to be the complete encyclopedia of woodworking (who would want to carry around that book anyway). I use this book more everyday to help me find other resources and to decide which method is the best for my skills and resources.  There are a lot of useful jigs, equipment advice, shop setup tips and woodworking tips in this book but for the most part they are not complete. That does not take away from the book but rather is a good reminder for what has already been learned but is a bit foggy or points you in the right direction. Having already purchased "Working Wood" by Jim Tolpin I was slightly disapointed in this book purchase. Not because it is less complete or written poorly, quite the opposite in fact, but because they are almost the same book. If I would have been more discriminating I would have purchased this book as my general wookworking book and augmented it with more specific books rather than doubling up. This is the best general wookworking book I have seen. Just don't expect it to teach you dovetails in its entirety (or any technique for that matter).
