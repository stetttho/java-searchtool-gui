 Along with Michael Moore, Anne Coulter, Sean Hannity, Al Franken and others of their devisive ilk I throw Horowitz's book on the trash heap. The idea from both sides seems to be deride anyone seen as the opposition and label them as conservative or liberal and assume that those words are absolute in meaning and absolutely evil.   Tip O'Neal and Ronald Reagen use to share drinks and discussion despite their political opposition. I like to think that Reagan would be ashamed of books like this and Coulters. I hope the line is equally long in deriding the equally devisive liberal books.   As a centrist I have good friends that are wide right and wide left. If you care to get to know them they all love their country despite different ideas about how to love it. They back different parties and have different issues close to their hearts but they care deeply about this country. If you can see only hate for those who do not think like you without thought or heart I have only pity for you. To think that the liberal left would side with extremist Islam is absurd. Taking examples and twisting them to seem like alignment and then further extrapolating to cooperation is fiction not non fiction.
