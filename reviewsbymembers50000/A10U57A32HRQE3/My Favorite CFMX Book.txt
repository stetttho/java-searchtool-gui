 I have about 5 books on CFMX and this is the only one I use anymore. It seems to be a book that is either loved or hated with no room in between. I loved it and in the past I have not liked Forta's books.  I learn best by getting the big picture and seeing how the pieces fit rather than learning about the pieces and then building the big picture. This book allowed me to see the bigger picture and how the pieces fit in it. Another reviewer complained about the explanation of the cflogin function. This was the very reason I loved the book. I looked at the code and glanced through the text for any needed explanations and the confusion I had was cleared up in a matter of minutes. An hour later the administrative site I was working on had much cleaner code and it was working properly. Not every tag is covered in detail but most of what is covered in the body of the book was easy for me to understand. If you learn like me I highly reccomend it.
