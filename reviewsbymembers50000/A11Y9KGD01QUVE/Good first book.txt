 I hoped that this would be better. My trash reading is vampires and this one looked as if it would be a good fit. This one is "ok", and if you hate spending time reading something that is "ok" then don't.  The characters were unbelievable. The story line was interesting for the first 250 pages, but the writer could have spent more time describing the differences between the cities rather than making them all appear as drab, and that every main character would receive this little booklet was silly.  Oh well.
