 I have several books on SQL Server 2000. This is the best one, because the author gives a personal viewpoint to the material. It is filled with suggestions and explanations. The author writes in a conversational style. The sections on security and restoration are the best I have read because the author knows the subjects and gives you an understandable reason why he made his choices. Highly recommended. This book sits on my desk next to my other favorite references on SQL Server.
