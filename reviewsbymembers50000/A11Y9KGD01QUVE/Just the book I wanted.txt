 I have been working with SQL (the language)for years and SQL Server for about two years.  This book is filled with SQL code. I picked up several tricks in just the first 8 chapters. I enjoy the style and the absence of  screenshots of Query Analyzer. Mr. Henderson is good at explaining why the  code is written and when you would want to write this type of SQL  statements. I recommend this book for anyone with some experience in SQL  and some frustration with SQL Server.
