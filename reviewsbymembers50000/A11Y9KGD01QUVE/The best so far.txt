 There are many advantages to reading the Bible each day. This is the best one for Catholics - the translation is good, and the format is simple. It does not usually take 20 minutes to read that daily section.   As someone else pointed out, the New Testament selections are in a different order than usual. That's not a bad thing, but I would like to know the reason for this order. It may be when the various epistles and gospels were written (except we start with Mark - maybe they wanted to be sure that we began with a gospel).  What is missing? An index or table of contents listing the daily readings would be handy. A commentary would be a welcome addition.
