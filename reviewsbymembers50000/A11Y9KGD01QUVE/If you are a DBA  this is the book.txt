 I have been amazed about how much information is in this book. The writing is clear and concise. The long section that details query tuning was an education in itself.  I finished the book with a clear understanding of the types of queries and how SQL Server uses them.  This book is sitting on my desk now. If you want the information on how to optimize your queries, or the database, this is my recommendation.
