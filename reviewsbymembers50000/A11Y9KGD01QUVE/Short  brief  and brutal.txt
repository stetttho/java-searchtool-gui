 I chose this book on a whim. I enjoy essays, and I thought it would be a pleasant way to spend an evening. I found something more. This book is entertaining, funny, and interesting. If you do not agree with a writer, don't worry, another will start in a few pages. All of the essays are well-written and most have their tongue firmly planted in their cheek.  Granted, if you are not a fan of Firefly then this would be wasted on you.
