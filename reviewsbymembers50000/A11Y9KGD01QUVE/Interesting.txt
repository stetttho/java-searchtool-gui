 Incorporating martial art techniques and golf in 51 minutes. I went  through the exercises and then took it to the range. I feel it will really  help my game.I have a tendency to swing out then in (or over the top), and  the exercises give me a clear feeling on how I should swing. I've stopped  trying to hit the ball and am just enjoying the swing. Highly recommended.
