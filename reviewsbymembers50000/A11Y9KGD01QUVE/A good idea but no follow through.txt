 This is an ok overview of UML (the Cliff Notes approach) and design patterns. I picked up this book because I hoped to learn more about design patterns and how they relate to Visual Basic. Most of the books, so far,  have been based on the C/C++ world. The first section on UML covers the  basic aspects with only simple detail. The design patterns take up the rest  of the book, but the same minimalist approach is used. The code samples in  the book are only partial and don't really give you a good idea of how or  when to use this type of pattern. The text is clear, and if you only need  an overview; if you have been chosen by your project manager to give a  presentation to 25 people on design patterns and Visual Basic and it will  only last two hours, this book is the one to buy. If you actually want to  use patterns, choose Microsoft's Visual Basic Design Pattersn by William  Stamatakis.
