 I enjoyed this book. They make an effort to describe the age and the difference between Richard II and Henry IV. They spend some time on the poems, but not as much as I thought they would. They spend a lot of time describing the downfall of Richard. The ruthlessness of Henry and his new government underline the power and its pursuit.  I gave it fewer stars because it was repetitive.
