 I purchased a new 7500 Elite on amazon.com in August 2004 after our old trusty original Sonicare gave out (it was 4 years old and the batteries would not hold charge anymore). After just one year the battery in this new 7500 Elite would not hold charge for more than a day and now in November 2005 would not even complete a full 2 min. brush cycle anymore. I called Phillips SOnicare Customer Support. They are quickly to get on the phone, you have to have the brush and charger at hand because they run you through a few tests. After the test they determined that the handle battery was defective and sent a brand new one without any questions asked. MAKE SURE TO SEND IN YOUR WARRANTY REGISTRATION WHEN YOU BUY ONE OF THESE !! The customer service rep immediately found my registration and purchase data and the warranty replacement was not problem.  RATING: Brush is only a 3 because it is the best brush out there, but has a short battery life. Customer Service is a 5+ because you get a very helpful person very quickly on the phone and warranty is no problem if you registered your product at purchase. Thank you Phillips!!  The replacement handle also comes with a renewed full warranty!
