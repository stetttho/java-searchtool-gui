 I have tried several pads for this orbital buffer. Especially those sold by Griot's garage and I have to say that these original P/C pads work the best for me. They are soft enough, yet firm enough and much thicker than the other pads. One drawback is that they do not last any longer, but then they are cheaper than the hook and loop pads anyway.
