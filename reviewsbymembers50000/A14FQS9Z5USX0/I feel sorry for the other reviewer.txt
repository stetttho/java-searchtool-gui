 ... he or she should not be left alone with any home appliances!!  But anyway, we had one of these little Bissels now four almost four years and it has been a savior for the carpet in two homes. Now the battery is finally to the point where it won't hold charge and the tank/collector started leaking. I am galdly buying a new one today because if used as intended for small spots, it works great! Important is to lift off any fluid that's on the carpet first, then thoroughly (!) soak the spot with the cleaning fluid and suck it in the machine. DO this twice, for which there is enough fluid in the tank, and your spot will be gone. I love this little machine!!  Excellent with kids and pets.
