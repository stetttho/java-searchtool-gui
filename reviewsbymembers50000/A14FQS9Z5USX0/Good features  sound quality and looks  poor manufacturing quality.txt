 Hey Delphi, c'mon... this is really not necessary. The radio features, looks and performance are great, but it is of a surprisingly poor manufacturing quality. The large turn dial has some hard spots when it becomes very difficult to turn, then loosens up again just to get hard to turn a little later on. The buttons on the radio are rubber and all sit crooked in their sockets. Because of that they rub on the case and are hard to push because of the rubber friction against the case. Besides the already mentinoed design flaw that the buttons are illuminated, but the labels are not (duh!). All buttons require a different amount of force to push and sometimes because of the friction, you have to push twice to complete your selection.   Next, the vent mount of the car kit does not match the radio base because the middle rib of the vent mount is too big for the radio base. It looks like there was a running redesign of one of these items and the other was not adapted, so the vent mount is entirely useless. Instead of the several, mostly flawed mounts included, Delphi should do away with them and just include one window suction cup mount like SIRIUS does in their Starmate Replay package. Too bad that a radio with great features is hampered by such a poor manufacturing quality.   We have Siruis on the boat and XM in the cars. Right now it's hard to say which service gets the nod, since we are not interested in sports or Howard Stern.   I think form a music offering there is not much of a difference and the plans are costing exactly the same. It is really up to what service you already have sine a second receiver is always subsedised and costs less than one from the competing companies.
