 This guide together with the "Chile Footprint" is the perfect combo for the first-time Chile traveler. Why? This guide will quickly and informatively bring you close to Chile's geography, history, culture, ethnic groups and most all aspects important to know when travelling there for the first time. It is not too "scientific", nor is it too superficial. Just right.  It is a colorful and high quality book (Discovery Channel) that I was not able to put down until I went through it all.   NOTE: This guide however does not suffice to give specific direction for restaurants, hotels and other facilities or locations needed by travellers. Therefore by itself it is insufficient. For the travel agenda detail you need to get "Footprint Chile". A perfect Chile guide just like a Frommer's. Both books together are the perfect combo !!
