 For a novice like me with long but limited wine knowledge this is a perfect companion. I consider this THE enceclopedia for all wine related questions. It would be hard to find a more comprehensive compendium on wine.  Equally recommended for the beginner or evryone who needs answers to his questions regarding wine. KEEP IN MIND: This is an alphabetic enceclopedia type of book.
