 This is the detail "travel agenda and planning guide" you want to determine hotel, transportation and other location detail. It is very much similar to a Frommer's Guide.  It is sorely missing color and story. Therfore it is boring to read. That's why I only gave it four stars. But Chile guides are not plentiful. This is designed to be more of a reference guide and it is good at that. Don't expect to get enough info on geography, history, politics and the people of Chile.  The good news!! For the information missing in this guide, you should definitly get the "Insight Guide" "Chile & Ester Island" (Discovery Channel). This book has the color and information to give a Chile novice all they need to know about Chile's geography, history, people and politics. I could not put it down until I read all the way through it.  These two books are the absolut perfect combo for the first-time Chile traveller or Chile novice and really should be sold in a package. In tandem they cannot be beat. Get these two and you have the perfect travel guide package.
