 As with any current Jeep book that has been on the market for a while and has been reviewed for newer Jeep model information.....info on the newest Wrangler, the coil sprung TJ, is slim at best. Info on the Grand Cherokee almost non existent, except in the listing of OEM parts. Therefore it is only three stars for any YJ/TJ owner...As always, a great book for CJ owners!!! 5 stars for CJ readers.
