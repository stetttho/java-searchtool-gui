 As all "Illustrated Buyer Guides" so is this one a top notch resource for the numbers and detail guy or gal. One problem is that the version is getting outdated. Covers only up to the 1998 production year. Now that the f-body died, why not update it one more time for all enthusiasts. otherwise great book !!!
