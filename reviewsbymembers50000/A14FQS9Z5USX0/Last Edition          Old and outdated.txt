 This book was last edited in 1993. If you know anything about Supply Chain, you know that technology and management in this area has progressed light years in the last 12 years.  There are scores of newer and better books available. It was probably a good book in its day, but today it is so outdated, I would not pay more than $2 for it.  Be advised and look elsewhere.
