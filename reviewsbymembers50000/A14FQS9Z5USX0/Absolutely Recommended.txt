 As leader of a customer dervice dept. in a company who just implemented SAP, I can only recommend this book. Not only because its relevance to SAP users, but also because it is a very easy to read and excellent written introduction to modern supply chain management and it's basic functions and challenges. No matter if you use SAP or not, you will like this book if you are beginning to deal with supply chain improvements from a basic level. Read this before any other supply chain book and then compare. I am sure you will come back to this publication over and over again.
