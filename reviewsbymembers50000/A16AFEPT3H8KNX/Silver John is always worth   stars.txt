 Silver John is the best creation of a wonderful writer, Manly Wade Wellman.  Yes, it does have some Christian overtones, but it's not the usual Christianity of city folks.  This is the real, active Christianity of the Applachians.  By turns scary, funny, thought provoking and always entertaining, any Silver John story is worth reading.
