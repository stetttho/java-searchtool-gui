 The very best of Manly Wade Wellman was in his Silver John stories.  They are all well worth reading.  It's a combination of horror, folklore, fantasy and ethics, with John the Balladeer leading the way.  It's sometimes funny, sometimes scary, sometimes thought provoking and always entertaining and worth reading.
