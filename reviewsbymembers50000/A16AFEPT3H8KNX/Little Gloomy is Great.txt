 I have not seen this particular book, but I have read many Little Gloomy comics, and they are WONDERFUL.  The characters are fascinating, especially Carl Cthulhu.  If you are a fan of Lovecraft, and also of some seriously funny humor, you will love Little Gloomy.  This book did come in, and I have read it.  It is wonderful.  Easily worth 4 stars, and maybe more.  it's issues 1-4 of the comic, and one complete story.
