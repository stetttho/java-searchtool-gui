 For those who are tired of horror novels and stories that are nothing but superflous sex, spewing entrails and heads lopped off, this is your horror novel.  It's subtle, thought provoking, emotionally compelling and still a wonderful horror read full of ghosts and nonhuman creatures.  It follows a family through several generations, and often reads like a daytime soap opera, then, seemingly out of nowhere, the horror or supernatural enters.  This a a wonderful read.
