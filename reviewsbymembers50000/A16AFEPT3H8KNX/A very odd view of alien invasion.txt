 This spoof is very good for what it tries to do.  The actors are endearing, if sometimes a little "thick", the writing is wonderful and bitter and the story line is so off the wall that it actually could be true.  You will NEVER look at a trailer park in the same way after you see this movie, or look at portapotties, or accordians, or packing popcorn.  Yes, they are all involved in this neat little story.  Not the finest movie I've ever seen, but one that I love to watch for its great comedic moments.
