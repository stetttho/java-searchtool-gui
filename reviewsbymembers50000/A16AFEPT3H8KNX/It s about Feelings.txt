 To be honest, I use this book to weed out new people.  If they really like the book, then they can become friends.  If they dislike this book, or if it's "just okay", then I really don't want to know them.  That's how good Callahan is, and how much the writing of Spider Robinson means to me.  This is damned good stuff, people.  Damned good stuff.  If you don't like it, it's because you are not capable of feeling the human (or humane) condition.  If that's true, I pity you.
