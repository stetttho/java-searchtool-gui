 Toots is one of my all time favorite jazzmen, so it's probably no surprise that I give this 5 stars.  When you add the wonderful guitar of the late Joe Pass and the solid bass of Pedersen, you really have something special.  Fantastic guitar solos from Pass, wonderful harmonica solos by Toots, and some really nice bass as well.  I think the best track, though, is the solo guitar track, not by Pass but by Toots.  Simple, heartfelt and emotionally charged.  This is probably my second favorite Toots CD, after the duet CD with Kenny Werner.
