 There has never been a good movie made of a Lovecraft story.  Let me say that again.  THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A GOOD MOVIE MADE OF A LOVECRAFT STORY.  Having said that, this combination is probably the most watchable of movies made from Lovecraft except for "Resurrected".  "Die Monster Die" is based on "The Colour Out Of Space" and the changes are huge and basically unforgivable.  Only Karloff's presence makes it fun.  As for "Dunwich Horror", well, it stars Sandra Dee.  That should tell you something.  If you absolutely have to see movies based on Lovecraft, these two are far better than the horrible "Unnameable" series, but not by a whole lot.  Yes, I have them.  I'm just not sure that I'm proud of that fact.
