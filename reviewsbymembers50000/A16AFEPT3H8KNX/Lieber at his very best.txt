 Imagine a world where the church ran everything.  Sound good?  Well, it's not.  Just like in the middle ages, this church rules with an iron hand.  Since God must be with the church, then opposition to the church is considered witchcraft, and it seemingly comes from Satan.  A wonderful view of the negative possibilities should once single religion ever really take over the world.  Lieber is a master writer, and this is one of his very best novels.
