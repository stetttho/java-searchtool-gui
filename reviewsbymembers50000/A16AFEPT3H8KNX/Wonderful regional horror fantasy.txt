 Anything by Manly Wade Wellman is worth reading, but his Silver John series is by far his best writing.  It's funny, sad, scary, exciting and philosophical at the same time.  It's obvious that Wellman spent time in the mountains of Appalachia, and knows the people there.  This is well worth reading over and over.
