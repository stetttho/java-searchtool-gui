 After so many horror films that were excuses for spewing entrails, heads lopped off and supurfluous sex, this one has some really creepy moments.  Yes, the plot is a bit muddled, and acting sometimes seems a bit overstated and the writing is a little strange, but the overall affect is one of real, serious creepiness.  It's sure not the worst horror film I've ever seen, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to be creeped out, rather than grossed out.
