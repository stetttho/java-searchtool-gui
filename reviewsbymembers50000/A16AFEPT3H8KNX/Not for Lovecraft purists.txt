 This is not a bad book, but it's not good Lovecraft.  Yog-Sothoth has now become an "extension" of Cthulhu(?), and this whole story is definitely not in any Lovecraft, or Derleth, or any follower of Lovecraft, mold.  With that out of the way, it's not a bad story.  A little too much emphasis on sex, but that's not unusual for today's writers.  The characters are a little two dimensional and just slightly too "heroic" for their own good.  If you love Lovecraft, don't even think of reading or buying this book.
