 I was one of the weirdos that didn't care for Evil Dead 1, but I loved 2 and 3.  I REALLY loved Bubba Hotep.  This one is at least as good as Bubba.  Funny, caring, occasionally sad, a lot of different emotions.  Bruce is just Bruce, which is usually quite brilliant.  The two ladies are not only very attractive, but both of them can act, too.  A rare combination anymore.  All of the acting was top notch, as was the writing.  If you love Bruce, please get this one.  It is well worth seeing.
