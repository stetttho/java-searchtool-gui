 Hodgson's The Night Land was a great book, marred by the very painfully awful prose that Hodgson chose to use.  The concept, though, is chilling.  In this book, you have the concept wonderfully explored, and the writing is much easier to access.  All of the stories were at the very least good, and some were incredibly good.  I loved "Mouse in the Walls of the Lesser Redoubt" and "Eater", but all were well worth reading.  If you like your horror with a scifi edge, but still chilling and horrifying, please read this book.  It's well worth the time, and the money.  I am very eagerly awaiting Volume 2.
