 There are other recorded performances of Mysterious Mountain, but this one has always been the best one.  Hovhanness's music is very spiritual, very emotionally compelling and always uplifting.  It takes a special conductor to create the mood that Hovhannes needs for his wonderful modal music.  This performance outshines all the others I've heard.  The Seattle Symphony performance is good, but this one really captures the mood, the feeling, that makes Hovhanness's music so wonderful. If you never buy another "classical" recording, please buy this one.  You will thank me if you do.
