 Hard to believe that Shaun Cassidy created this series.  It's dark, subtle, fascinating and exciting.  Gary Cole, who has NOT been one of my favorite actors, is absolutely brilliant as Sheriff Lucas Buck (who may or may not be human) and Brenda Bakke really steams up the screen as the sexy schoolteacher, Selina.  The rest of the cast is also great, especially the creepy Marly.  I am so happy to see this series coming out, finally.  Now, if the studios would only release Brisco County on DVD.
