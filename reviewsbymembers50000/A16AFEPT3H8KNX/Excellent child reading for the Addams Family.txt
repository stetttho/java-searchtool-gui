 Very well done.  The poems sometimes stretch a bit, but then, it's sometimes hard for find words to rhyme with Nyarlothetep or Cthulhu.  The drawings, though, are wonderful.  If your intention is to twist your child, much like Wednesday Addams, then this book is essential.  Personally, though, I prefer to twist myself, and this book does that very well.
