 Lovecraft mentioned this novel in his "Supernatural Horror In Literature" essay, and had good things to say about it.  The novel deserves the good words.  The first half, before our hero finds the inevitable woman to complete him, is really dark.  A man alone, totally alone, with only corpses around him.  I think that would send me "over the edge", too.  Shiel captures the pathos of the situation well.  Unlike Lovecraft, though, I like the "romantic" ending.  At least the human race will not die out.  This is well worth reading.
