 There are several absolutely wonderful writers of classic SF that are nearly forgotten today.  Unfortunately, Fredric Brown is one of them.  Whether it's his short fiction, as in this book, or his wonderful novels, including "What Mad Universe", all of his stuff is wonderful and well worth reading.  Brown, Henry Kuttner, CM Cornbluth, Richard Matheson, so many others.  All of them created the SF today, and most of their stuff is superior to the SF written today.  Please, if you love SF at all, read Fredric Brown.  You will thank me if you do.  He is wonderful.
