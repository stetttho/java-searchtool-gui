 Jack Williamson was one of the guiding lights of science fiction during the "golden age".  His writing is always excellent.  That said, this has to be one of his greatest achievements ever.  It's dark, hopeless and tragic, but still filled with the possible triumph of the human spirit.  The main story, "With Folded Hands", though, is one of the most touching pieces of writing I've ever read.  Please, I beg of you, read this book.  It is one of the greats.
