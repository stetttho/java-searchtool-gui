 Chuck Greenberg was one of the true geniuses of modern new age/jazz.  A wonderful melodist, a more than competent instrumentalist, a far better than average composer and a great lead musician or sidekick.  This CD shows him at his best, although there were some unbelievable duets with Chuck and Will Ackerman, too.  The duets here are with Alex DeGrassi, who ain't too bad a guitarist himself.  As usual, Chuck is brilliant, melodic and wonderful.  Do yourself a HUGE favor and buy this CD.
