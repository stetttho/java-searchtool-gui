 If George Orwell's "1984" is considered an important book, then this is an important movie.  Both could easily be the United States in just a few years, when the government rules us all with an iron hand, making all the important decisions for us.  Yeah, kinda like Bush right now, isn't it?  I just hope that when it happens, we have someone like "V", and Evie, to show us the way.  The way things are going in the US right now, the fiction in the movie could be the hero and heroine, not the totalitarian government.
