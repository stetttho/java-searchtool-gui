 Silver John wanders the Appachalian Mountains with his guitar strung with silver strings in search of adventure and good songs.  On the way, he finds various supernatural opponents and he vanquishes them.  That's the story, but it is so much more than that the way Manly Wade Wellman tells it.  This is writing of the highest order and stories actually based on mountain folk tales and superstitions.  Please, I beg of you, read these stories.  It's hard to describe, but Wellman's writing is just so wonderful and his characters so well drawn.  This is GREAT stuff.
