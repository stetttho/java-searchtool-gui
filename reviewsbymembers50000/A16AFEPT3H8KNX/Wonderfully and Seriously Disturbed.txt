 Christopher Moore is a very disturbed individual.  Fortunately, that means that his writing is wonderful.  Although this is not my favorite of his books, it ranks very high.  He uses characters from previous books, so you know them if you've read his other works, and they act pretty much as you would expect them to act.  The premise of this book is so disturbed that I'm not even going to begin to describe it.  Just read this book, and Moore's other books, if you love humor, horror and side splitting laughter.
