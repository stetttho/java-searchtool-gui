 Toots was a one of a kind.  How many men would even try to play wonderful, bop oriented jazz on a chromatic harmonica?  Not only did he try, he damned well did it, beautifully, melodically and wonderfully.  If you don't have some Toots in your CD collection, then you don't have enough jazz.  He is a master, a wonder and a constant delight.
