 You won't be philosophical after watching this movie.  In fact, there isn't much you will be after watching this movie. It's pure escapism.  For a way to waste an hour or so, though, this is pretty good.  The story is weak, the acting is not of Oscar caliber and the writing isn't wonderful, either.  The story line is simple, though, and if you are a guy, the women are at least moderately attractive, and sometimes nude.  I would not call this a movie for the ladies, though.  At least not heterosexual ladies,
