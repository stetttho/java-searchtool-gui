 I've never read Pollitta before, but now I think I'll be seeking out his writing.  This is all the old British derring do stories rolled into one, along with a healthy dose of Lovecraft.  Exciting, adventurous and hilarious are only a few adjectives I could use for this book.  Excellent work.  A wonderful satire and a fantastically funny story.
