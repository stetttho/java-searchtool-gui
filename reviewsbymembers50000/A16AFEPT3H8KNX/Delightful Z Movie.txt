 This movie must have had a budget of $1.98.  For such a low budget, though, it is excellent.  It has the feel of Manly Wade Wellman, although the added Grandpa John, and the girl who isn't Evadare, don't fit.  Other than that, it's decent.  It's also rather antigovernment, but then, most intelligent people are, I guess.  The greatest evil has got to be Congress, right?  It's cheesy, but it's well worth watching.
