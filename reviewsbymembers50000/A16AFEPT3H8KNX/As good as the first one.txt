 Excellent.  It's best to read Radiant Dawn before you read this book, since Ravenous does continue the story started in Radiant, but both books are wonderfully written.  The characters are well drawn, the story is complex but fun to follow and although it's not exactly true to the usual idea of the Lovecraft mythos, it's close enough to be fun to read.  Yes, please read these two.  They are well worth the money.  Mr. Goodfellow, do you have any more novels ready to publish?  I will buy them
