 I have loved the music of Toots Thielemans since I first heard him with the George Shearing Quintet.  Toots has a wonderful melodic flow no matter whether he is playing a ballad or an up tempo bop tune.  On this CD, he is playing only ballads, and with another musician who has the same sense of melodic flow.  Werner is a very technically proficient pianist, but he allows the technique to be at the command of the melody.  With two wonderful melody players playing really lovely ballads, this CD radiates warmth.  It is all slow and relaxed, but certainly not boring.  Of course, Toots is never, ever boring.  One of the best Toots CDs I've ever heard, and I love all of them.
