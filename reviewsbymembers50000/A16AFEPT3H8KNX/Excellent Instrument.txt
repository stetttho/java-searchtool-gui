 Although small, and rather high pitched, this is an excellent instrument for a pianist or keyboard player without a piano or large keyboard.  The sound is similar to a chromatic harmonica, and you can even bend notes like the harmonica.  Good for blues, jazz or any melodies.  You can play chords, and harmonies, but it does muddy the sound.
