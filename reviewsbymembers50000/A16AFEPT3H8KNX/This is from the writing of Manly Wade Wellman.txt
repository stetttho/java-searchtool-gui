 If you haven't read Manly Wade Wellman, then you have missed a wonderful opportunity.  It's good writing, and the best of his writing is about Silver John, who wanders the Applachian mountains finding song, and dealing with supernatural evil, often with the help of this book.  No, it's not a grimoire, but it does have some wonderful folk wisdom that will make the major drug companies hate you, since you won't be buying their drugs if you use these natural remedies.  A wonderful book, and even today, well worth reading.
