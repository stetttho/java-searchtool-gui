 This is not a great movie, but it is a movie that you can watch over and over again.  It has lots of action, some good comedy, some suspense and even some intellectual commentary.  In other words, something for everyone.  Bob Newhart is wonderful as the "Head Librarian", and all the other actors and actresses are very good.  For those who like this, there is even a catfight between two very very attractive ladies.  Yes, it's fun to watch.  No, it won't give you the secret of world peace, or end world hunger, or even pay your bills for you.
