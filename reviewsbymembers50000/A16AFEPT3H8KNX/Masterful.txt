 At the risk of making enemies, the movie is actually more effective than the novel, and that is very rare.  James's prose is sometimes difficult to wade through.  He was a great writer, but sometimes a great writer has problems with a horror story.  The movie, however, is brilliant.  If you love gore, blood, sex, and all the 20th century crap, then you will hate this movie.  If, however, you love suspense, terror and truly imaginative horror, then you will love this movie.  It is second only to the 1963 version of Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting" as effective, yet subtle, horror.
