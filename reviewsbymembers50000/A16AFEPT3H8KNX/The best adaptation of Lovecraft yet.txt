 It's black and white, and silent. Not a combination that would excite a modern movie fan.  But this is the very best movie of a Lovecraft story yet made.  One other reviewer said that the stop action Cthulhu was cheesy.  Well, yeah, but cheesy in a wonderful way.  If you are a Lovecraft fan, you need to see this movie.  Very well done, a lot of fun to watch and very true to the original story.  Well worth 5 stars, or more.
