 An excellent movie for either man or woman.  It has its scary side, in the character of Lyle, a psychopath, a love interest in Jack and Willie, and from a male point of view, Mia Sara is wonderful gorgeous even when she tries not to be.  Her one nude scene is well worth seeing.  She is just as attractive nude as she is clothed, if not more so.  Not worth 5 stars, but worth at least 4.
