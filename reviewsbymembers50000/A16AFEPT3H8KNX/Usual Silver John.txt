 Yes, I read the other review.  It's true, and it's not.  Manly Wade Wellman did actually live in the Appalachians, and he knew the people he was writing about.  They are Christian, but not the Christians city folks are used to.  These Christians actually studied and followed the teachings of Jesus, unlike 104% of modern city self professed Christians.  The stories are a combination of mountain folklore, pure fantasy and Christian principles.  As such, it is well worth reading.  Anything by Wellman is worth reading, but most especially the Silver John series.
