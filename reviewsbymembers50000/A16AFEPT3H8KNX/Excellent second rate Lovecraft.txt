 Brian Lumley is an excellent writer.  That is fact.  He has sold millions of books in his career.  These stories are basically from early in his career, though, when he was writing very derivative, but very effective, Lovecraft pastiches.  If you are a fan of HP Lovecraft, you will probably love this book.  If you are not, then you will hate it.  I loved it, and am glad that these stories are out in this edition.
