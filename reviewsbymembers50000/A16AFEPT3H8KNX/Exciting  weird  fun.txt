 Not a great movie, but not a bad one, either.  A rather convoluted plot, but followable.  The characters were well done.  If you are into catfights, the fight between Teri Hatcher and Charlize Theron is good, too.  These are two really lovely women.  One shot of Charlize nude, too.  A fun movie for a guy, and women would not find it too upsetting.
