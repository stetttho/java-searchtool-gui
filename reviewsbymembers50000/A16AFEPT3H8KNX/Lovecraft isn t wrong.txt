 HP Lovecraft called this book a masterpiece.  It is, and it isn't.  It's full of the late Victorian crap about endless love, and the word Love is always capitalized.  Our hero's treatment of the woman he loves is also suspect.  I doubt very seriously whether women's libbers would like this book.  (Do women's libbers read, though?) Still, the depiction of the Night Land is incredibly chilling and the obvious and unalterable end of humanity is also chilling.  We've finally bitten off more than we can chew, and the very universe itself is out to get us, and it WILL win, whether through the Pneumovores, or the Watchers or some other dark denizen of the Night Land.  This is difficult reading, both because of the prose style Hodgson chose and for the dark depressing subject matter, but it is well worth reading.  Also, please look for Andy Robertson's more modern book in the Night Land here on Amazon.  You need to have read this book before you tackle the Robertson, but both are wonderful reads.
