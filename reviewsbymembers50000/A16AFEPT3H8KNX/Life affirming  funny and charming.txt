 This is a wonderful film for all ages.  It is a fantasy, but it's more than just a fantasy.  It has elements of religion, philosophy, love and life.  Tony Randall is wonderful in all 7 faces, and as himself once too.  The stop motion monsters are cheesy, but that just adds to the charm of this film.  If you have children, this is a wonderful film for them, too.  No nudity, no swearing, no sex, nothing really objectionable.  Oh, some fairly mild scares, but even that isn't really violent.  A wonderful film.
