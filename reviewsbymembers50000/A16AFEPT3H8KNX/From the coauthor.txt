 This novelette is an attempt to capture the feel of what I consider to be the best of H.P. Lovecraft.  It borrows from his mythos and includes references to some of his invented books, creatures and places.  It is set in Ohio, though, and not New England.  Just as a side note, I mention the Ohio town of New Boston.  It did exist, but all that's left of it now is a graveyard and a state park.  Not a lot written about why it died out, at least until this book.
