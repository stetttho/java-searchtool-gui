 Based on Shirley Jackson's wonderful novel "The Haunting of Hill House", this movie is what a horror movie should be.  There are no spewing entrails, no vomiting pea soup, no heads lopped off, no sex for the sake of sex, only a very creepy, eerie story, well told, well written and well acted.  My teenaged daughter had bad dreams for a week after watching this movie, and yet there is no monster, creature or ghost on stage, and nothing really visually frightening happens.  It's left up to the viewers imagination, and that can be the most frightening experience of all.  In my humble opinion, the very best horror movie ever made, based on the very best horror novel ever written.
