 Anything by Manly Wade Wellman is worth reading.  This is no exception.  He was so great at regional horror as well as traditional horror and even Lovecraftian horror.  Please, if you love good horror, get all 5 of Wellman's books from Night Shade Books.  They are all well bound, good looking books and they all have Wellman's wonderful prose.
