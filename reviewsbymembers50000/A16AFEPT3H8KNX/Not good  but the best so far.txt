 Lovecraft stories have yet to be turned into good movies, or good TV shows.  Even the great Rod Serling failed to make a decent Lovecraft show.  Still, for what it's worth, I'm glad to see this movie released.  Based on Lovecraft's short novel "The Case of Charles Dexter Ward", it's not too horrible.  The movie people do add Ward's wife, who didn't exist in the story, and a private eye, who also didn't exist in the story, but they also remove Dr. Willett, who was one of the main characters in the story, so I guess it kind of balances out.  The feel is good, though, and actually fairly Lovecraftian.  I was impressed with the acting, because Chris Sarrandon was the only name I was even barely familiar with, and then it was because of Susan that I knew his name.  If you love the tales of Lovecraft, and also love movies, then this movie is by far the best adaptation.  Almost as good as "In the Mouth of Madness", although that is NOT really a Lovecraft story.  It just feels like it.
