 Oscar Peterson was one of the finest jazzmen in the history of jazz.  When he was "on", NO ONE could cut him.  He is definitely "on" here.  Surrounded by musicians nearly equally competent, this CD is a prize.  Milt Jackson is driving, Joe Pass is brilliant, Toots Thielemans is wonderful and the rhythm section pushes things along beautifully.  This is not only great jazz, this is GREAT JAZZ.
