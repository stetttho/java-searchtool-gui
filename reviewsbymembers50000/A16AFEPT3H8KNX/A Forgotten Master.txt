 Henry Kuttner was a master of thoughtful, humorous and bitter scifi.  He was so prolific that he used at least 5 pen names, including Lewis Padgett.  My all time favorite story is "Mimsy Were The Borogroves".  If that story doesn't give you shudders, then you are no longer alive.  His stuff was well written, well plotted and wonderfully presented.  If you have never read Kuttner, I envy you.  Reading him for the first time is an amazing experience.  Please get this book, in whatever form you can.
