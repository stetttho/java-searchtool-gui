 Martha Stevenson has a new family. Her dad remarried, and she now has a new stepbrother. When she moves from Chicago to a small town -- Bedford -- she thinks that her life is at an all-time low. She's dead wrong! Martha starts receiving threatening phone calls and grotesque pranks bring her life down even more. Soon after, she learns that someone was murdered in her new house -- in her room, specifically. But even before she hears the news, she senses a menacing evil within the house. Something -- or someone -- wants to repeat history, and in order to do that, they must kill..... I thought that "Trick or Treat" was great. It was definitely suspenseful and even reminded me of the horror movie "Halloween," with the murderer appearing out of the shadows.....It wasn't the best I've read by Richie Tankersley Cusick, though. I've read two others by her and they were a little more action-packed. The culprit is surprising, yet a little predictable if you think about what happened throughout the book. Overall, a nice read! Also recommended: a.) "Starstruck" by Richie Tankersley Cusick b.) "Secret Santa" by D. E. Athkins c.) "The Train" by Diane Hoh d.) All books by Joan Lowery Nixon
