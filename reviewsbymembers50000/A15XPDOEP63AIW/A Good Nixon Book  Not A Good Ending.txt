 I thought that "The Stalker" was another good thriller from Joan Lowery Nixon's endless list of great mysteries! If this is going to be your first Nixon story, it'll seem totally great! But, if you've read lots of Nixon books (like me), it can't compare to most others!  The story is about a girl named Jennifer. One day, she comes home and finds out that her best friend -- Bobbie -- has supposedly killed her own mom! Jennifer knows that that can't be! So, after no one will believe her, she enlists the help of a retired cop, Lucas Maldonaldo, to help her with her detecting! As the couple come closer and closer to finding the murderer, Jennifer's life begins to end up in danger. Someone obviously doesn't want her to find them out! Can Jennifer and Lucas add up the clues and wrap up the case!? Or will the killer stop them dead in their tracks? Find out in "The Stalker!" Also recommended: "Name of the Game Was Murder," "Who Are You," and "Nobody's There." All A+ Joan Lowery Nixon books! :)
