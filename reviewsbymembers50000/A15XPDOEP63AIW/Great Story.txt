 Darcy is dumped by her mom, and left at her Uncle Jake's house. His home is inside a horror museum -- The Dungeon of Horrors, which he owns. As soon as she arrives, strange things start to occur. Girls start turning up in dark alleys with their throat slashed, and two lipstick marks on their necks -- implying a vampire bite. Darcy's thrown into the midst of the terror when she believes that she's being stalked and receives a threatening note under her pillow. To add to the situation, she starts suspecting that someone she knows is the killer! Will she survive long enough to find out?..... "Vampire" was a very good book, and up to par with a great author -- Richie Tankersley Cusick. This was my second book by her, and it was great! Keeping that in mind, it did have a few flaws. It was a bit hard to get into, and didn't get straight to the point. Aside from that, it wasn't too fast-paced. The ending (being the most important part of a book -- especially in mysteries) was satisfying, but not completely shocking -- like most other books. Still, it was unique how the author made you change your mind three times about who the killer was before they were revealed.
