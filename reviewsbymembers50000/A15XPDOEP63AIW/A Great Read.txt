 Julian Dax is the new guy in Randy's life. One night, while she's taking out the trash, he appears out of the darkness, and from there, she falls in love with him. Randy's always been the sensible one, the one to do the right thing. Her father's away for three weeks, and Julian spices up her life. He gets his kicks out of pranks and scaring people. At first, the stunts are harmless, but they get deadlier. Who is Julian? He's always appearing out of nowhere, right on cue, and soon his jokes will ultimately lead to murder!.... Sinclair Smith is an awesome author! She definitely has a knack for jokes and pranks (such as in "Double Date"), but the idea seems to spawn hits. I felt that "The Boy Next Door" was a very thrilling, suspenseful book. You wondered what Julian was going to think of next, and you didn't know if the main character was starting to go crazy or not. The only flaw was that the ending was a little rushed and a bit hard to follow. Otherwise, it's worth your time!...
