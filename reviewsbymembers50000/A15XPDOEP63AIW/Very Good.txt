 Diana Connelly is amongst the hundreds of new employees at the Crossroads Mall. The mall will be opening shortly, and all workers must prepare for the grand opening. After hours of preparation, the police come to advise them of a winter storm. After the cops arrange driving situations, there are still people who need a ride home. Eight friends give up their vehicles and decide to wait-out the storm at the mall. They use a furniture store for sleeping purposes, and restaurants are open to them, care of management, for food. They think that things couldn't get any better until someone in the group is found dead. Was it an accident, or is someone out to get them? The question is answered very quickly when another person is found....The phones are dead, and each person receives ominous messages....Who's doing this, and who will be next? I thought that "Slay Bells" was very entertaining! Reading it within a few hours definitely added to the on-going suspense! The storyline was very original, and so were the murders. Also, I like how it was different from most other thrillers. Instead of starting off with the suspense, it had foreshadowing, which didn't rush the book, like most other thrillers. Even though it was strong in those areas, it lacked logically. How coincidental that all the people that the murderer wanted to kill were the ones stranded at the mall? Also, the way the friends disposed of the bodies were very radical, and didn't seem to have a long-term shock on any of the friends until the third murder! Still, the book deserves five stars for originality and suspense, which is the main purpose of a thriller, right?..... a.) "The Train" by Diane Hoh b.) "Secret Santa" by D. E. Athkins c.)
