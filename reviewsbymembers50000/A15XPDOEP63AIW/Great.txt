 Livvie has a new stepfather. Since the day she met him, she thinks that he's overly-nice and fake. In addition, everyone else thinks that he's the best man to ever walk the face of the earth! One night, while her mother and stepfather are out, Livvie stumbles across the "Fugitives from Justice" TV show. She thinks nothing of it until she sees a very familiar face across the screen -- her stepfather's! He's wanted, under a different name for the murder of his wife and stepdaughter! How can Livvie prove that her stepfather is a madman? No one will believe her; they'll think she's going over the edge! Still, somehow, someway, Livvie must do it. Of course, there is the minor detail of her stepfather coming after her, stopping her from exposing him. He'd have to be crazy to try to get rid of her, too! Right? Then again, he'd have to be all along!...... I thought that "The Stepdaughter" was very nice. It wasn't your average stalker-type thriller -- it was unique. The only downfall would have to be the first half of the book. It takes time to get into, and the author crams the events into the last 20 pages or so. Other than that, it is a wonderful story that will prove the phrase "looks can be deceiving!" Also recommended: a.) "Someone at the Door" by Richie Tankersley Cusick b.)
