 "Don't Scream" was awesome to say the least! The storyline revolves around a girl named Jessica, or Jess. Two guys just moved to the small town of Oakberry; one of them right across the street! Just as things begin to look up, they take a turn for the worst. Jess realizes that she knows nothing about these guys. Plus, they both seem so intent on changing the subject when the topic involves where they came from, what they like, etc. Especially Scott! Those dark eyes, almost scary, seem as though they're always lying; hiding something. Then, things begin to go totally downhill when her neighbor's cat disappears, preceding her own cat's dissappearance! Who's doing this? Jess can't help but suspect Scott, especially after she finds out that he's not who he says he is! After all, he did say he hated cats, right? This book is for anyone, like me, who love mystery/thrillers. Especially those who love Joan Lowery Nixon. Also recommended: "Name of the Game Was Murder," "Nobody's There," and "Who Are You," all by Joan Lowery Nixon! Enjoy!
