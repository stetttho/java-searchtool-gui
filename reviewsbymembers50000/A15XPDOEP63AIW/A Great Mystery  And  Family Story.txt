 I thoroughly enjoyed Joan Lowery Nixon's, "Nobody's There!" Not only was it another awesome thriller from Ms. Nixon, but it was also a great family story...  The storyline revolves around a girl named Abbie. Her father recently left her, her mother, and her brother for another woman. One night, while Abbie is spying on her father and his new romance, she becomes so furious when she sees her kiss him, that she begins to throw rocks at her window.  Now in trouble for malicious mischief, Abbie's judge understands (to a certain point) what Abbie is going through, and puts her on probation. For a punishment, she is put in the Friend to Friend program, which is a program in which high-schoolers visit and look-after elderly women a few times a week.  When Abbie is assigned to Mrs. Merkel (an extremely grumpy woman who is totally disagreeable), she considers quitting, but hangs in there. Mrs. Merkel is a part of a book club, which is turned into Buckler's Bloodhounds (a new program where elders try to stop other elders from being tricked by con artists).  Mrs. Merkel gets way too involved, thinking she is a real private eye, which could be dangerous...  One day, Abbie decides to skip a visit to Mrs. Merkel's, but afterwards feels guilty. So, later that night, Abbie goes to visit Mrs. Merkel only to find her laying in a pool of blood. Mrs. Merkel ends-up in a coma, and Abbie is determined to find the culprit. Could it be someone who was tired of her meddling around, and decided to put an end to it? Or is it something deeper than that? Find out in the stunning novel, "Nobody's There!"
