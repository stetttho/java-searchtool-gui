 Carolyn Baxter's father recently died. Soon after, her mother gets word that her aunt died and her house was left to them. Mrs. Baxter is set on transforming the home -- Glanton House -- into an inn. They need a stronger financial income, so they hire a drifter to fix up the house. This adds to Carolyn's wariness about the house. After all the ghost stories, the creepy housekeeper (Nora), and now the new drifter, what is Carolyn going to do? Joss is tall, dark, and handsome and seems to be there when accidents happen -- rescuing people. Then again, could he be creating them?..... "The Drifter" was a pretty good book. I love Richie Tankersley Cusick, but this story is her weakest one so far. It didn't hold my interest at all, and the ghostly scenery didn't intrigue me. While there were a couple thrilling parts, they weren't very shocking or surprising....Cusick just incorporated too many ghost stories, which I didn't like. Overall, especially if you're planning on reading this book, and this book only, you should read it. But, if you're going to read all of Cusick's books, put this one on the bottom of your list!......
