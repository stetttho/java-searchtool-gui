 Joan Lowery Nixon is the best mystery writer out there! I don't know how she does it, but every single book that she writes becomes a hit! She mixes terror and fear with love, devotion, and other common emotions to create stories that not only entertain you, but reach out to you! "The Ghosts of Now" was no exception. However, I feel that Nixon left the most important part of the story -- the ending -- in the dust; it was just way too abrupt and not suspenseful. Aside from that, Nixon gives away too much information about the characters too early in the story! The story is about a girl named Angie. One night, her brother leaves, but fails to tell Angie where. Since their parents aren't home, Jeremy feels as though he doesn't have to explain himself. After he leaves, Angie gets a call from a person who whispers to her that 'Her brother is dead.' Now -- with Jeremy in a coma, after being the victim of a hit-and run -- Angie sets out on a determined journey to find the coward that attempted to murder her brother. But, it's not as easy as it sounds. People around the town are "hush-hush" about what they saw they night, and Angie finds that the majority of them are lying! Who? Why? Angie tries to answer these questions before someone tries to stop her in "The Ghosts of Now."
