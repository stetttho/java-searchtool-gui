 Cleo and seven other friends from her high school are invited to a Secret Santa party by popular girl, Djuna. Why? Cleo is new to the school, and has barely said three words to Djuna this year! Before she knows it, she's whisked off by plane to a remote island in the middle of nowhere. After everyone arrives, odd things take place. Gruesome Secret Santa presents, traps set to kill, and eventually they all start disappearing, one-by-one! Who is this phsyco-Santa? What do they have in mind? Murder?..... "Secret Santa" was awesome! The writing style is unique, switching to each character's actions, which is confusing at first. But once you get in the flow, it's hard to get out! For once, the culprit shocked me! I remember saying to myself before the ending, "It'd be so ironic if the stalker turned out to be __________....." Sure enough, it did! Plus, the stalker's motive was genuine and realistic. Not petty. Apparently, this book isn't getting enough promotion, seeing that I'm the first person to review it after it's been out for a year. Maybe because everyone knows that D. E. Athkins' books are all out of print (except this one), they don't bother to check to see if there are any new ones. Well, there are, and it's an awesome thriller! Get your hands on a copy while you can!
