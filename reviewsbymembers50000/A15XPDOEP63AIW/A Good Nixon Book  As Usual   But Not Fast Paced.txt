 "The Seance" by Joan Lowery Nixon was very good. Nixon never fails to bewilder me with her writing talents. Unfortuantely, out of the four books that I've read by Nixon so far, "The Seance" has been my least favorite. The book would be a lot more interesting if it was more fast-paced. Instead, the book drags along, barely keeping you interested, until the last few chapters... The story is about a group of girls who get together one night and have a seance. They think it's all fun and games until one of the girls, Sara, starts to act very strange and the lamp plug is pulled out. When the lights are turned back on, Sara is missing. To make matters even more strange, both doors are locked, and Sara is found dead the next morning...Lauren is the main character. Sara lived with Lauren and her aunt as a foster child. Everyone thinks that Sara ran off with somebody and told Lauren her plan. And, after another girl is found dead, Lauren starts to suspect that whoever killed Sara is after her, thinking that she knows their identity...Will Lauren be able to figure out who Sara was meeting that night? Or will she be murdered before she can piece together the clues? Find out in "The Seance..."
