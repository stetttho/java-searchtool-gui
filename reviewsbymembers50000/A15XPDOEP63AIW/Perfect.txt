 Melissa is urged to compete in Westdale High's first homecoming in 25 years by her friends, Izzy and Celeste. At first, Melissa's anxious to start campaigning, however, her spirits are dampened when the news of why Westdale hasn't had a homecoming until now gets around to her. Apparently, homecoming queen Brenda Sheldon had an accident on the night of homecoming. Rumor has it that her ghost is still seen around town, wanting to reclaim her crown. After a brief scare, Melissa overlooks the talk, until terrible accidents start occurring to the others running for the title; two barely missing Melissa! Who's doing this, and why? The answer is revealed in the exciting conclusion!..... "Homecoming Queen" by John Hall was amazing! Mystery and suspense seems to wrap you up in an exciting blanket, nonstop! It was one of the few books that actually gave me chills. It is nicely descriptive, with a killer-surprise ending! The only flaw for me personally, was that I had previously read a book, "My Bloody Valentine," that was similar to this book, which took a little originality out of it for me! If you haven't read that book, though, you should be fine! Enjoy! Also recommended: a.) "Someone at the Door" by Richie Tankersley Cusick b.) "Starstruck" by Richie Tankersley Cusick c.)
