 Joan Lowery Nixon is the best! How she mixes the perfect amount of humor, love, suspense, and fear all into one book astounds me! "Spirit Seeker" is among the many, awesome thrillers delivered by Ms. Nixon. Keep 'em coming!  "Spirit Seeker" is about a girl named Holly Campbell. She has a huge problem! Her best friend -- Cody -- has just been accused of murdering his own parents! Her father is the lead detective on the case, and even he can't deny that all the clues point to Cody. He left his house after a heated argument with his parents, then returned later around the estimated time of death. Holly is positive that Cody wouldn't commit such an evil act, but how can she prove it?  At the scene of the crime, a strange woman named Glenda Jordan stops Holly. She claims that she's a clairvoyant and can see things (that she hasn't physically seen) in her mind. At first, Holly thinks that Glenda is bogus. But then again, why does she call her "Amber Girl?" After all, lately her amber hairpin has been glowing strangely with heat. Can she really help Holly find the murderer, or is she just wasting her time?  I though this book was good. Nixon has definitely written better. Strictly judging on mystery, I'd actually rate it poor. It had a more clairvoyant, fortune-teller, mystical feel to it (which in the end, turns out to have helped very little). I also think the main character could've dug deeper into the problem, instead of just insisting Cody was innocent. Unlike Nixon's others, there is no stalker, no detecting, and no surprise ending. Plus, Holly's endless, stubborn theory of Cody's innocence gets to be annoying....Overall, I sill think it'd be worth your time! Also recommended: "Name of the Game Was Murder," "Who Are You," "Nobody's There," and "Other Side of Dark," all by Joan Lowery Nixon! :)
