 Joan Lowery Nixon is a talented writer! Even though this wasn't my favorite book by her, she still made sure the reader feels as though they are in the story!... "The Dark and Deadly Pool" is about a girl named Mary Elizabeth. She just landed a new job at the Ridley Hotel's heath club. Her shift takes place from 3-11 PM. One night, while Liz is by the pool alone after closing, a person comes up from the pool and reaches out to Liz. By the time Liz calls security, the man is gone! Liz starts to realize that her new job is getting stranger by the minute when guests start to have their wallets pickpocketed. Not only that, but roasts and turkeys are being stolen from the kitchen, and two antique sofas are stolen by people posing as cleaners. Liz knows that these events must be linked, but how? Will Liz be able to detect what's going on with the Ridley Hotel events, or will her investigations lead her to death? Surely finding a dead guest in the pool will throw her off the case, right? Find out in "The Dark and Deadly Pool!" Overall, I think this story was very good. Nixon also incorporated romance into the story for a sure-hit! Aside from that though, I think that Nixon could have put a bit more action into it! Also recommended: "Name of the Game Was Murder" and "Nobody's There," both by Joan Lowery Nixon!
