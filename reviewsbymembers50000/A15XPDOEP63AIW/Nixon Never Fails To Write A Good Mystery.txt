 "Murdered, My Sweet" was one of Joan Lowery Nixon's best books! It was packed with redherrings (people who the author wants you to think the murderer is) and the murderer could've been a number of people. I must say that the ending was very abrupt and wasn't like all Nixon's other endings (action-packed and suspenseful). But, I'm still rating this a five because she made up for it with comedy and romance!..... The storyline revolves around a girl named Jenny Jakes. Jenny's mother is a mystery writer who is known around the world. Jenny and her mother are invited to their Uncle Arnold's party in San Antonio, celebrating the reading of his will. When they arrive the guests act mysterious and some even say that reading his will could be dangerous, especially since he made revisions. Before the will is read, Arnold's son, Porter, is murdered! When Jenny's mom -- Madeline -- starts to investigate, things start getting dangerous. Maybe the murderer thinks Madeline and Jenny know too much. Are they the next vitims? Find out in the thrilling, "Murdered, My Sweet!" Also recommended: "Name of the Game Was Murder" & "Nobody's There."
