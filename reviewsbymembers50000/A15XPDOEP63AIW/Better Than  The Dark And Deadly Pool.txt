 I really liked Joan Lowery Nixon's "The Weekend Was Murder!" This book is the sequel to her previous book, "The Dark and Deadly Pool," which is another hit! I felt that "The Weekend Was Murder" was better than the first, but was a bit confusing towards the beginning. There are so many names to remember and keep track of, that it takes away from the storyline... "The Weekend Was Murder" is about a girl named Mary Elizabeth (Liz). She works at the Ridley Hotel as a summer job. One weekend, the hotel hosts a murder-mystery weekend in which a couple hundred people act as sleuths and try to uncover a pre-determined mystery. Liz is one of the actors and is supposed to "find a dead body in one of the hotel rooms." When she finds a real body, it starts to become all too real! Who's the murderer? Is it one of the mystery weekend guests? Could it be the famous mystery author who is running the mystery weekend? Did she get caught-up in her stories and decide to commit real murder? Liz finds herself intertwined in a real murder-mystery in "The Weekend Was Murder!"
