 Tracy and her boyfriend Kyle are invited on the date of a lifetime by Christie and Travis. Travis is a very heavy practical-joker, and it shows from the very start of the date with his gruesome pranks. Tracy is uncomfortable at first, and feels that something isn't right. Why does Christie and Travis keep looking at eachother as though they're planning something? Like they hold a special secret? Tracy is forced to believe it's just her imagination by her boyfriend, who finds the pranks funny and harmless. But nothing's funny when Travis takes them all to a deserted mansion and they each start disappearing, one-by-one! "Double Date" was awesome. It was so interesting that I finished within 3 hours! From the very first page, it has you hooked, which is a great start. From there, the book zooms by, each page holding a different surprise, until you realize that you're finished. The only downfall that I could think of is that towards the end, the killer's attempts were a little weak. Other than that, a must-read! Also recommended:  a.) "Amnesia," also by Sinclair Smith b.) All books by Joan Lowery Nixon
