 Livvie has a new stepfather. Ever since the day she met him, she was uneasy about him. She felt that he was fake, and acted overly-nice. Still, nothing prepared her for what she saw on TV one night while everyone was gone. She never expected to see the face of her stepfather on the "Fugitives from Justice" show, wanted for the murder of his wife and stepdaughter fifteen years ago! How can she prove to herself that he did -- or didn't -- do it? Everyone thinks that he's the nicest man to ever walk the face of the earth! Most of all, what happens if -- or when -- he suspects her of snooping around his past? He would have to be crazy to try to come after her, right? Then again, has he been all along?  I thought that "The Stepdaughter" by Carol Ellis was one of the best books I've ever read! Every chapter kept you on the edge of your seat! Is there a reasonable explanation, or is Livvie's stepfather a murderer? Find out in "The Stepdaughter."  Also recommended: a.) "Someone at the Door" by Richie Tankersley Cusick b.)
