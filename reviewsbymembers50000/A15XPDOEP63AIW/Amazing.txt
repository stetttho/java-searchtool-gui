 When Miranda gets the call from "On The Edge" magazine telling her that she's won a contest to stay at movie star Byron Slater's California house and get the chance to star in his next movie, she's thrilled. Byron Slater is the hottest topic of teen action-romances, and to be able to spend the week in his house is unbelievable! As soon as she arrives, she senses that Byron has taking a liking to her and he starts confiding in her. He tells her that he thinks that someone might be stalking him and he feels in danger. Then, the sickening "accidents" start. Or are they accidents at all?..... I thought this book was great! Richie Tankersley Cusick weaved suspense and romance throughout the book just right. I'll probably end up agreeing with the other reviewers in saying that this wasn't the author's best. This was the first book I read by her, and, standing alone, it seems terrific. But, compared to her other books, it might not seem as good. I'll admit, though, that while the book was suspenseful, it was a little predictable and the killer was, too. Other than that, I loved it! Can't wait to read more by her!.....
