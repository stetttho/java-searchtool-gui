 This book is about a girl named Dina. She has Hodgkin's Disease and becomes friends with a 9-year-old girl named Julie in the hospital. Julie was in a car accident in which her parents were killed. She has no other relatives, and she is terrified of a man she calls Sikes. She insists that he killed her parents and is coming back to finish her off. Will Sikes put Dina's life in jeopardy to get to Julie?... Overall, "The Specter" was average. I'll admit that there was a stange twist at the end, but the rest of the storyline was bland and boring. There wasn't much mystery until the last couple chapters, and it was a little predictable. Joan Lowery Nixon is my favorite suspense author, but it seems like her earlier books weren't as good as her newer ones (such as "The Seance" and "The Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore"). Back then, there wasn't as good of sources for ideas, such as scary movies, etc., so I forgive her.... Also recommended: "Name of the Game Was Murder," "Who Are You," "Spirit Seeker," and "Nobody's There," all by Joan Lowery Nixon!
