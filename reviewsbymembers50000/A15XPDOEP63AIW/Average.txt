 Maggie Keene's mother is working desperately trying to restore the town's old, historical courthouse. The town has a new one built, but Sheila Keene is a member of the Women of Heritage Club, which specializes in cultural matters. Maggie and her friends would rather have the place torn down for a new rec center, and apparently someone else does, too. A little too much! When the accidents start happening, everyone believes that they're just coincidental. But soon, they become more gruesome and more deadly. Someone would kill to have the place torn down, and they just might get their wish!..... I thought that "Blindfold" was nothing special. In my opinion, it's very hard to get into, and the suspenseful events were few and far between. It talks about the courthouse for a considerable amount of the story, and doesn't get enticing until the last few chapters. If you're on a mission to read all of Diane Hoh's books, like me, then it would be okay to read it. But, if you're looking for a thriller to pass the time, don't expect the time to pass very fast with this one.....
