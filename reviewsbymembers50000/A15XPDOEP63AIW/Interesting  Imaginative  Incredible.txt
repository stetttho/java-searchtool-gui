 Sarah is stunned when she receives an invitation to the biggest party of the year. The hostess -- Cass Rockham -- doesn't even know Sarah! She's not part of the "in" crowd, nor very popular. So why is she and four of her friends invited? Something doesn't seem right to Sarah, but, because of her friends' anxiousness, decides to attend. The party gets off to a weird start when they play a game of musical chairs. One by one, each of Sarah's friends conveniently lose and are whisked off for a "consolation prize." But, why aren't they returning? Soon, Sarah's the only one left, and, she too, is separated from the party. Her question is answered when she is locked in a secret room, all by herself. Cass has decided to play a game of "people hunting," a variation of "treasure hunting," starring the five "losers" of the party. But, someone out there is playing a game of their own. Kidnapping and torturing each and everyone of Sarah's friends. Who is it? Why? How can they be stopped?..... I thought that "The Invitation" was a very unique book. The storyline was very imaginative, and not your everyday thriller. The way the pieces to the puzzle fit together made perfect sense, and went smoothly. However, it did seem a little rushed! Still, "The Invitation" is a top-notch thriller that is not to be missed! Enjoy! Also recommended: a.) "Someone at the Door" by Richie Tankersley Cusick b.)
