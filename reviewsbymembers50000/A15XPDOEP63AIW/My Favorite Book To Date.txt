 Hannah and Meg live miles from the nearest neighbor. There is a big snowstorm on its way, and they've heard that if the power is to go out, it can take weeks to restore it! Still, they aren't worried about being home alone until their parents call to tell them that they're snowed-in at the airport. The call from their parents and the news brief that an escaped killer is headed in their direction is the last two things they hear before the electricity goes out. Then, in the middle of the night, the two sisters get a knock on their door! Two wounded, half-frozen strangers stand in their doorway, asking to stay the night. Of course (for protection, according to them), they refuse to leave in the morning, and strange things occur. The dog disappears, along with their axe, and the girls realize they don't know the guys at all! I thought that "Someone at the Door" was unbelievable! Richie Tankersley Cusick (one of the best horror writers out there) concocts a story full of mystery and horror. The scenery adds to the suspense; two girls, miles away from anyone, helpless. The events were thrilling and surprising, and the ending was shocking. A must-read for all horror fans! Also recommended: a.) "Starstruck" by Richie Tankersley Cusick b.)
