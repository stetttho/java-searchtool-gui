 Joan Lowery Nixon is definitely the best mystery writer! With "The Other Side of Dark," she went an extra mile, with her super-descriptive adjectives, and her page-turning charisma! She actually made you feel sorry for the character, as though you were a friend! Could it get any better? Please tell me when it can!.... The story is centered around a girl named Stacy McAdams. She wakes up in a hospital bed, having no idea why she's there! She's quickly informed that she was shot, and had just awakened from a coma four years later! The person who shot her killed her mother, and now Stacy is seventeen (only knowing how to act like a thirteen year old) feeling all alone. But, wait! The murderer would flee the country, right? He wouldn't be crazy enough to come back for Stacy! Would he? Also recommended: "Name of the Game Was Murder," "Who Are You," "Nobody's There," and "Ghosts of Now." All by the magnificent and talented Joan Lowery Nixon!
