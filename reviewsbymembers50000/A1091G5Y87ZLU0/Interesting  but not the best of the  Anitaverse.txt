 Fans of Ms. Hamilton are very familiar with the world that her character, Anita Blake, dwells in.  It's our present day world, the only difference is that monsters, ie...Vampires, werewolves, zombies, are a natural part of  everyday life.  To say the "Anita" world is highly creative and  immensely entertaining is an understatement.  I couldn't read the series  prior to this book fast enough.   This novel, however, I did not find as  fasinating as the prior installments.  Dealing more with Edward, one of  Anita's human friends, the plot, though well developed, was not the  gripping adventure that I'm used to seeing in her books.  Also, I must  point out that Edward is not one of my favorite characters.  He is the  least well defined, and also hard for me to learn to like, even though, in  this book, he is a little less cold blooded. I also have to say, being a  fan of her prior stories, that I do miss the regular characters that  normally bring humor, action and interest to storylines.  Even though Anita  is the main character, I'm a little more fond of some of the  "monsters" than of Anita herself.  I also happen to be a  Jean-Claude fan, her main Vampire, and his absence in this book was keenly  felt.   This book is an interesting read, but it is also quite violent.   The other books have also been very violent, which I don't have an  adversion to, as it normally fits well within the story.  I think I just  noticed the darker side in this book was thicker because the characters  were less easy to like or understand.   For those who are familiar with  the Anita universe, I would recommend reading this book.  For those that  are not, I would recommend starting with the earlier books to understand  Anita and her world a little better.
