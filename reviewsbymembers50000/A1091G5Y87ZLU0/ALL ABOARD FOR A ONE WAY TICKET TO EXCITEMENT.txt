 Night Train to Memphis is my favorite book to date written by the marvelous Elizabeth Peters. Once Ms. Peters introduces a character to you, you find a new friend.  This book, in the ongoing saga of Vicky Bliss and  friends, is a treasure.  Even if you haven't read a "Vicky" novel  before, you will soon be drawn into this tale of adventure and romance amid  the ancient pyramids of Egypt.  With a hero to-die-for and a heroine who is  as smart as she is beautiful, this book is a must read. Ms. Peters gives  her readers the greatest compliment of all...she doesn't insult their  intelligence.  Her stories are full of historical data along with plots and  twists that satisfy even the most devious of mystery lovers.  Check out  Night Train, or any other Elizabeth Peters novel....you'll be glad you did.
