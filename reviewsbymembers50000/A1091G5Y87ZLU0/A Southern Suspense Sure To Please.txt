 I've always been able to depend on Nora Roberts for an entertaining story, but her latest works have been top of the line storytelling at it's best.  Carolina Moon is a bit more gritty and earthy than some of her prior  novels.  It's a well rounded read, filled with complex characters and  intense plot lines.  Tory, the heroine, is quite engaging, not a simpering  southern belle, but a deep individual coming to terms with her past as well  as looking towards her future.  Cade, as the understanding hero of the  book, is not just a spoiled rich boy, but a man who tries his best to be a  fair person in a climate where right isn't always the most popular course  to follow.  With supporting characters that are just as interesting as the  leads, this book is a can't-put-down kind of story, with nail-biting  intensity.  It's Nora Roberts at her best!
