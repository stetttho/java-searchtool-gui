 I'll admit, having never heard of an heir hunter, I wasn't surehow interesting I'd find this book.  Mr. Larsgaard has done awonderful job, not only introducing a field that I knew nothing about, but writing a very entertaining story as well.  This is not just a very good first novel, it's a terrific book period.  The characters are well defined and have indepth personalitles. You care about the characters from page one.  The storyline is complex and compelling. It was quite a page turner and I hope that Mr.  Larsgaard plans on a long writing career in the future.  The main character, Nick, came to life throughout the pages.  With twists and turns, as well as intrigue and conspiracy, this book made for quite an exciting ride.  It's very much worth reading.
