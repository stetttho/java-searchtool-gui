 Actually, anyone who reads this book will be smiling too!  This is one of those rare stories that draws you right in.  You feel as if you, yourself, are walking on the hillside, with the beautiful native flowers all in bloom. Or sitting in the charming local pub with all the delightful town  characters, hearing the tales told from generation to generation while  listening to the music a true Celt never forgets.  A wonderful mixture of  romance and Irish folklore, this book is a treasure!  So get cozy with a  cup of tea(and if you add a dollop of whiskey to warm the bones...nary a  soul will think less of ye!)and have a grand old time with a truly  pleasureable read!
