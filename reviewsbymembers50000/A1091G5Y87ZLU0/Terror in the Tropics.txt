 High Tide, though enjoyable, would not be my first recommendation for a Deveraux book.  The characters in this book are less well-defined than they are in her other novels I've had the pleasure to read.  Her  "Montgomery" heroes are normally "to-die-for" types  with a great sense of humor.  The humor in "Ace", the leading  male character, is lacking as well as the three dimensional qualities  normally present in Deveraux's other work.  The plot, while interesting, is  also less in depth than I am used to seeing in her novels.  High Tide would  be a pleasure to read, however, if you're looking for a nice way to spend  an afternoon or a day at the beach reading.  If you are looking for a  better example of Deveraux's writing, I may suggest A Kight in Shining  Armor.  That book is a gem.
