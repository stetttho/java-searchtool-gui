Ms. Michaels has wonderful three dimensional characters to go along with  her chilling tale that takes you from the present to the past, with all the  mystery and intrigue you can possibly desire.  Walker is a wonderful book  to cuddle up with on a dark, stormy night...but do yourself a favor...you  may want to leave the night light on after you read it!
