 This CD is a beautiful collection of love songs.  I like all different types of music, but after hearing Michael Ball, I must admit that other artists pale in comparison.  His voice is lovely and each song he sings absolutely rings with emotion.  I have long been a die hard rock music fan, although I enjoy music as a whole.  Thanks to PBS for introducing me to Michael in the 10th anniversary of Les Miserables, I have found that I have a new appreciation of music that I would have passed up on and would have missed something very special.  Songs Of Love is a magical audio treat that is such a pleasure to enjoy.  Pay special attention to Walk Away, my favorite, sung with such feeling, it brings tears to your eyes.  Do yourself a favor....light a few candles, sit back with a mellow glass of wine and listen to this true gift of music!
