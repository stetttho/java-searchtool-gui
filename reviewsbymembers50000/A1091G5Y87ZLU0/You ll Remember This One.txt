 Hat's off to Mr. Koontz! False Memory is a true page turner.  Every character in this book has depth, whether it be the hero, Dusty, the heroine, Martie, or Dusty's burnt out bro, Skeet.  I was drawn in from page  one, through a story that get's more intense with each paragraph.  To me, a  great author is one who makes you care about the characters, whether those  feelings are good or bad.  This book has it all....three dimensional  characters, an excellent plot, and enough intrigue and terror to keep you  breathless.  Also, cudos to Mr. Koontz for his ability to care about the  animals in his novels and giving them "stage time" so to speak.   For myself, an animal lover, I applaud his efforts to show the depth of  character in the animal realm as well as the human realm.  This book is a  winner!
