 At one point, I would have described Grisham's writing as intense, devious and entertaining.  This book is not impressive.  I actually had to force myself to read it, while nodding off between sentences.  The plot was  ingenuous, however, the book missed it's point in the non-descript  characters.  In other Grisham novels, even if you hated the character or  what they stood for, they were three dimemsional, well-written beings.  The  "Brethren" were three of the most tedious beings I've had the  displeasure to encounter in a novel.  The other characters in the storyline  were equally as uninteresting as well.  I have to admit, this was certainly  a dissapointment.  After such wonderful novels as A Time to Kill and The  Client, both The Brethren and The Testement were a decline in work for Mr.  Grisham, at least in my opinion.
