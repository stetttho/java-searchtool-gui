 First off, "Insturrection" is a space opera, nothing more. Those looking for character developement or character interaction will be sorely disappointed. Although Weber's hand will be apparent to fans of the Honor Harrington series, particularly in the description of naval space battles,  it is clearly lacking in both pacing and  characters. "Insurrection" chronicles a war of secession in the  Terran Federation. Its inspiration lies squarely on the american revolution  (with even some overt and explicit references in the book), but the action  departs rather quickly from it. Most of the book is spent on following a  few characters (all of them flat) as they fight bloody naval battle after  battle. The battles themselves show Weber's steady hand and excellent story  telling. However, the book feels extremely choppy, with months falling off  "between chapters" followed by entire chapters which describe the  action of only a few hours or days. This gives the book an uneven feel  which makes the whole suffer. Fans of space opera on the grand tradition  of Doc Smith will probably be reasonably satisfied by  "Insurrection" and its epic battles, despite its flaws in pacing;  however, if you require characters to go with your action, you might want  to stay away from this one.
