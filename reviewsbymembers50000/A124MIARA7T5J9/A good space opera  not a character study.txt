 "Crusade" is billed as the second book in the trilogy which also comprises "Insurrection" and "In Death Ground." However, chronologically, it goes before "Insurrection."  "Crusade" is a space opera, with a handful of interesting  characters, that are nonetheless one or two-dimensional at best. Fans of  Weber's Honor Harrington series will see his hand at the orchestration and  description of the space battles, as well as some of the personal clashes  and resolutions (one in which a naval officer faces down the local  government and industrial lobbyists by quoting case law comes to mind).  However, the lack of compelling characters makes it overall a book inferior  to the HH series. On the other hand, as pure space opera this is a  remarkably good and entertaining read. After their Orion allies are  attacked by mysterious ships, humanity (in the form of the Terran  Federation) must meet the challenge and defend their honor, or risk a new  war with the Orion Khanate. From then on, the book will spend most of its  time either describing fleet actions or preparations and consequences  thereof, with a few passages given over to character interaction (but,  alas, never character developement). In the grand tradition of the Doc  Smith space operas, in which characters are flat and almost secondary to  the action, with one larger than life character orchestrating it all (in  this case, two: a former president and a naval admiral), the book has no  apologies to make and is an excellent specimen. If that is all you are  looking for you will be happy with your purchase and entertained  throughout. If you are looking for a bit more character, however, you will  probably be disappointed.
