 This books marks the beginning of the Honor Harrington series. David Weber has managed to translate the napoleonic wars into a space setting, justifying it all with careful detail on the technology that makes it  possible. The details are legion: ships and detachments months out of  communications range, broadside battles, and the interspace war between a  monarchy and a corrupt republic. But that isn't all. Although Weber  spends some time (and written word) on establishing his world, he does not  forget to let us get to know his main characters. The hero is Honor  Harrington, Commander in the Manticoran Space Navy, commanding a light  cruiser. But other characters, which will continue to reappear as the  series goes on, also populate the pages, giving us glimpses (from the brief  look into the merchant magnate Hauptmann to the breaking and remaking of  Alistair McKeon) of characters whose complexity is clear and will only  continue to develop. And of course, there is tension, both military and  interpersonal, giving it all a nice sense of balance for those interested  in characters and those interested in hardware. Weber also takes a lot of  care to portray the military discipline of life aboard a ship of war  realistically. I have recommended this book to a number of friends, and  they all became hooked on the series. If you like science fiction with a  good mixture of both hardness and space opera, then this book is definitely  what you should read.
