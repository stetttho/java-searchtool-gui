 Those looking for some more (well deserved) bashing of the postmodernist academic left, such as that found in Gross and Levitt's previous book "Higher Superstition" may be disappointed. This book is a  collection of papers delivered at a conference held under the auspices of  the New York Academy of Sciences, organized by the authors. The papers vary  both in quality and in thrust depending on the author. The book is  divided into 11 sections, each containing three to five papers that fit  into the general category. Categories include "The Public Image of  Science", "The Foundations of Physics", "Health",  "Environment", "Feminism", "Humanities",  "Religion" and "Education", among others. It being  proceedings from a conference, few papers actually delve into particular  examples of bad science. Notable exceptions are "Building bridges to  Afrocentrism" by Ann Macy Roth and "Whatever happened to  historical evidence?" by Mary Lefkowitz, both of which contain  criticisms of many afrocentrist claims regarding the egyptians, among a  handful of others. Other papers talk about the philosophical underpinnings  of the postmodernist movement, or survey some of the literature, or  encourage scientist to speak up in defense of science against the attacks  by those championing the irrational. Many authors try not to get into  discussions of validity in order to not be seen as "preaching to the  choir", which can leave the lay reader looking for more postmodernist  howlers feeling ill-served. On the other hand, the articles contain a  wealth of information in the form of references, and mark trends both of  the anti-science academic left and her critics. Not recommended to  non-scientist (read Gross and Levitt's other book instead), but those with  a keen interest in the debates what what science "is" will find  it an interesting and thought provoking read.
