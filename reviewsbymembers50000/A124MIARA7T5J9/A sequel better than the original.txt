 "In Death Ground" is the third book to come out in a series which also includes "Insurrection" and "Crusade." "Insurrection" takes place many years after the other two books,  however. "In Death Ground" is, chronologically, the sequel to  "Crusade"; moreover, it reuses many of the characters from  "Crusade," as well as relying on background information provided  by that book. So "Crusade" should be read prior to "In Death  Ground." That being said, "In Death Ground" is a book  which is superior in many ways to "Crusade." At heart, both books  are really nothing but space opera, in which space battles play a major  role. But whereas the characters in "Crusade" were flat and there  was little change in them from one end of the book to the other, this is no  longer the case for "In Death Ground." Finally, what Weber has  learned elsewhere gets a chance to shine here. His hand is clearly present  at the description of space battles, but some of that great character  insight he has shown (in the Honor Harrington series) he is capable of  finally makes an appearance in this book. The plot is straightforward,  pitting again the Orion-Earth Federation Alliance against a new foe. Battle  after battle follows, but this time we get insight the head of a few of the  captains and admirals commanding this battle (something sorely missing from  the previous book). As opposed to both "Insurrection" and  "In Death Ground", the issues are NOT resolved in this book;  clearly a sequel is planned, and I hope not too far away. In summary,  this book is pure fun space opera, but with some actual three-dimensional,  evolving characters thrown in. Fans of mindless space opera will no doubt  enjoy it, as will those who require a bit more depth to their science  fiction. But beware: you should probably read "Crusade" first,  and that is, unfortunately, an inferior book to "In Death  Ground."
