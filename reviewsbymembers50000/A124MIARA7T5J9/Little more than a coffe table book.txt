 I bought this book hoping for more than I found. There is information on the hierarchy inside a ship, as well as (very) brief historical accounts of the mutinies at Spithead and the Nore, and a little background information.  Although interesting at times, e.g. when pointing out that the Glorious  First of June was actually a strategic defeat for the Royal Navy, it is  much too brief on its accounts of famous battles such as Trafalgar and the  Nile. Some information on the ships is provided, but not enough for a  non-sailer to get his bearings in a Hornblower book. The author keeps going  out of his way to mention the defeat of the Royal Navy at the Battle of  Lake Eerie (which is at best tangential to the subject matter), and to  namedrop Hornblower whenever he can. The book contains some nice  illustrations, mainly paintings, and some interesting information, but it  reads like nothing more than a coffee table book, superficial in its  infomation, merely hinting at things I was hoping to learn through it.  There are also a number of typographical errors that ought to have been  corrected but weren't, giving the entire book the air of something dashed  off in a hurry and with little care. I was hoping for much, much more than  I received.
