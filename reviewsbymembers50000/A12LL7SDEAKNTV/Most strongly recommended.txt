 It's no secret that "Vjesn Svjashchjnnaja" ("Spring Consecrated", a literal translation of the original Russian title) is an exceedingly difficult piece to understand;  doubly so if all one can do is hear a recording.  A score is essential for it to be fully understood - and what better way to handle this challenge than via this reprint from a Soviet edition(outstandingly accurate yet inexpensive)?  Another bonus:  you also get to sample some of the thinking and ideology that Communism was forcing on its people in all regards and all walks of life - outstanding reminder of what political correctness can do to us all(this warning especially meant for those who believe in it in any way whatsoever...)!!  Buy this without delay!!!
