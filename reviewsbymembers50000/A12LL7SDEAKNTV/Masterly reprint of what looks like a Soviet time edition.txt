 I say "Soviet-time" because of the use of the new-style, modern Cyrillic characters - the composer wouldn't have hesitated in the days before the Communists reformed the Russian language to have used letters that got eliminated post-1917.  Otherwise, an excellent reprint (though I think the original edition could have been printed on somewhat fewer pages if the paper-size were larger without losing any clarity or ease of reading) - any lover of this piece or composer - or of opera or even classical music generally should have this in his/her library!  Most warmly recommended!
