 Ideally, I'd have given this recording 4.5 stars (the thing that bothers me is Marie Collier's howling and crying as Chrysothemis:  much as it is indeed called-for in the score, it seems overdone...);  since that's not available, let it have the full 5 as it otherwise deserves it.  This is particularly so given its presenting the full uncut musical text of the opera (apparently all the other recordings, with the possible exception of the Sawallisch, have the same 6-7 cuts that are usually made with staged performances);  in any case, the performances (particularly those of Solti and the Wiener Philharmoniker, as well as of Nilsson and Krause - what power!!!) make this recording an absolute must in any serious classical music collection - especially with any Straussians!  People, do your best to get this recording (even if you need to order it from Amazon's UK subsidiary, where it's readily available as yet!).
