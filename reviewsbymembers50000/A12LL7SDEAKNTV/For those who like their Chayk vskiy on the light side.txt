 If I had had the chance to hear this before buying (even with 1-minute samples), I would NOT have done so!  4th = 3.5 - 4 stars; 5th = 3; 6th = 2.  Ashkenazy's somewhat cool, no-nonsense approach works better in Rakhminov (I can recommend his recordings of that composer's symphonic music unreservedly) than in Chaykvskiy.  The 4th symphony works well that way;  the other 2 come off however quite shallow (perhaps in part because of what I've come to know and value of other performances over the decades) and even at times mechanical.  The 5th still has some fine moments, but the 6th truly is a loser...  If Bernstein earlier came off at times as over-calculated earlier, it still beats Ashkenazy!
