 Since other people have already described the opera's content quite reasonably well cumulatively, I'll simply re-affirm their recommendations especially relative to the other two recordings I've heard of this piece: Gjrgijev (on www.gmn.com with his Kirv-Marinskiy Opera Company - NB, this recording of a live performance at London's Barbican Hall is not for commercial sale and needs a good internet connection to be properly appreciated) and Chung (on Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft).  Those who don't like Vishvskaja's voice, in my opinion, will still find her much more classy and appealing - as well as orthodox in treating her part - compared to Ewing on the Chung recording.  Although both take a few liberties with the occasional note and/or rhythm, there's no question that Vishvskaja is far more convincing, respectful of the composer's intentions and tasteful (that she studied the part with Shostakvich himself {they were very close friends!} is so obvious as to defy any attempt at refutation).  The same applies to Rostropvich, even though brass-haters might gravitate to Chung on that basis (here the brass really let rip, though nobody is slighted all the same!):  the seal of authenticity is impossible to shake from this recording even though DGG has a somewhat clearer sound allowing more detail to come across at times (and Chung has to also get credit no doubt too for that extra-transparent sound there).  No question that I find Petkov much more sinister compared to Haugland with Chung as the evil, incestuously lecherous father-in-law Bors (quite aside from Chung encouraging all his singers to think more along the lines of "Sprechstimme" to the point of abuse!) - and here Haugland is more in his element as the Police Sergeant.  All in all, although some details occasionally get muddied up (e.g., Bors's first entry in ghost-form obliterating the woodwinds on this recording), this reading is far more compelling in every way (and it shows just how every bit of Shostakvich's vocal writing is eminently singable - contrasted to the complaints of his first singers before Stljin banned the opera outright, as Vishvskaja relates in her autobiography).  Don't hesitate, anybody who reads this and wants to explore this opera (especially for the first time!!!):  THIS is the recording to get!!!!  Afterwards you can also check out the other two or more that may be around;  but even a seasoned Lady-Macbeth "lover" like me gravitates back to this recording each and every time without fail!
