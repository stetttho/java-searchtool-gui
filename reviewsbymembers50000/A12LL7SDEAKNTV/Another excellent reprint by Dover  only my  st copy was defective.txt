 Once I got past the defects of my 1st copy (which had to thus be exchanged), there is no question of this being another gem to add to Dover's collection of fine reprinted 1st-edition scores, with this one to boot having the bonus of having apparently-decent singing-translations in German and English in addition to the original Russian version by Konstntin Blmont which Sjergjy Vasljevich Rakhminov set.  [The very fact that the English version used in the score is NOT the original Poe poem-set can indicate just how virtually untranslateable poetry usually happens to be (hence one book trying to do that writing of such attempts as 'a study in failure')!!]  The only regret from this non-Italianophile writer is that the the instrumental nomenclature is in Italian (unlike the same original publisher's "Ostrva Mjrtvkh" {Isle of the Dead}, Op.29, which was basically done in German);  however, that's inconsequential.  [Another thing that might have been of help could have been to print the two scores in one volume;  furthermore, the original publisher Gutheil often lets blank staves fill up pages and systems where perhaps they could have profitably been omitted - but that's not Dover's fault at all...]  Otherwise, bravo Dover!!!!
