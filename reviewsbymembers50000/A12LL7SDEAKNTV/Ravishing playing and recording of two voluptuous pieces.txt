 Here is a recording that ought to win any and all waverers who might initially be discouraged by the reputation or the music of the mature Schoenberg.  [Only those who are utterly bigoted against him or whose sophistication and taste are relatively lightweight are likely to resist this music and recording.]  This is due both the the sumptuous sonorities and playing of the Berliner Philharmoniker as well as to the recording itself (though it's a pity that DGG didn't dare use the CEDAR de-hissing technology that Decca/London has been doing, including Solti's recording of Richard Strauss's "Elektra" - it would have helped even better!).  This recording in particular was the one that opened my eyes to the beauties of the symphonic poem equivalent of the Debussy opera on the same subject.  In this incarnation, "Pellas und Mlisande" can already be seen as a step leading away from the openly-Romantic feeling of "Verklrte Nacht" and "Gurrelieder", with the dissonances becoming more powerful, the horizontal quasi-contrapuntistic thinking and the orchestral sonorities of later works coming into brighter focus (already noticeable in the opening 4-6 pages of the orchestral score).  It therefore already serves as a good bridge between his earlier output and his even more radical 1st Chamber Symphony while still plainly indicating how much of a Romantic Schoenberg remained at heart and would remain so.  This is an absolute 5 stars and more!
