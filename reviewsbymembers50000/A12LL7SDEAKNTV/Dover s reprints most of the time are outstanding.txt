 Sure, there can occasionally be problems with reprints of older editions (and I've seen some quite poor ones at that, notably with Kalmus!);  however, this one of Dover (as well as their reprint of the same composer's opera "Pellas et Mlisande") is not one I'd slight in the least.  My copy has very few problems indeed.  I recommend this one unreservedly!
