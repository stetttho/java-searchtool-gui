 Having now heard the recording, I must express some disappointment with it and the hype in its favour as follows: - Nuccia Focile is excellent with her singing and characterisation as Tatjna;  however, it's obvious that neither she nor Neil Shicoff (who doesn't strike me as having the real nobility of voice for the rle of Vladmir Ljnskiy) have fully mastered their Russian diction.  Most of the time they're OK, but now and then when they slip, it's noticeable to this Russian speaker.  [No such complaints generally apply to Dmtriy Khvorostvskiy, ljga Bordina, or Irna Arkhipva - this last-named is a revelation of how well a voice can beautifully survive the wear of time, well done!] - Sjemjn B'chkov jars with some of his conducting, both in terms of letting the singers have excessive liberties with the music and also with some of the emphases in the orchestral writing which at times seem vulgar!  [A case in point concerns the Prelude to Act I:  where is the yearning Rostropvich so beautifully brings to that critical overture, taking his time and not over-accenting where it's best not done?  Alas, other conductors are worse as described below...] - Furthermore, I strongly object to the cossaises of Act III being cut on recordings!  [This is caught due to knowing the movements from other recordings plus following with the Dover orchestral score.] - The twin stars of this recording that most impress me thus are the St. Petersburg Chamber Choir (they really sound fabulous!) and Irna Arkhipva. In sum:  good but not great.  [What on earth has happened with the 1969 recording with Rostropvich conducting with his wife playing Tatjna - that's the one I'd recommend and would have preferred to go along with by far...alas, Bors Khakin's handling of the Prelude to Act I is even worse than B'chkov, while Solti (from the samples provided) seems somewhat less than fully involved with his soul in this music!]
