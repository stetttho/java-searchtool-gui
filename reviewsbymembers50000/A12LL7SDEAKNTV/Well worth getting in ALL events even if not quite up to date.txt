 The reason for the above title is that Debussy made a few alterations (almost exclusively additions to the score in terms of orchestration - though there are one or two lines missing that also apply to the singers) after the publication of this version of the orchestral score (even up to not too long prior to his death).  However, one will have to be prepared to shell out $190 US. to get the latest version (published by Edwin F. Kalmus) - which is a whole lot more;  particularly given that anybody with a keen ear can capture most or all of the orchestral changes by listening carefully to recordings - and jotting the changes down either right into the score or at least onto copied pages therefrom with extra staves added as necessary (the latter eventuality - one passage in Act II, scene II, where a trombone is added to the texture) only needed in 1 case in so far as I've been able to determine).  Engraving is of excellent quality, and it's quite easy to follow!  Definitely a must for any interested party's library - it's a steal!
