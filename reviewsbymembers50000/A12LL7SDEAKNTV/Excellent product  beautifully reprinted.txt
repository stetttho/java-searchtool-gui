 This is a reprint of the original Gutheil score issued when the work was published.  Sometimes I wish that empty staves could have been eliminated, but given how time and again instruments not expected at the moment are nevertheless called upon, that's a minor fault at worst.  Very legible, authoritative and a pleasure to have - be it in one's lap when following, or on the podium for conducting!  Buy it!!
