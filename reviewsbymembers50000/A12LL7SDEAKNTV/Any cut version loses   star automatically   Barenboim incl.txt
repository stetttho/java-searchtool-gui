 From hearing the samples, this seemed to be a very winsome recording of the opera.  The principals all are most competent, with a beautiful tone-quality with Deborah Polaski in the title-rle (almost sounds at times like Birgit Nilsson, when heard over the relatively lo-fi sound available through a computer with those small speakers...).  The same can be said of Waltraud Meier as Klytmnestra, and the care they pay to the notes they sing definitely reaps lovely results.  Barenboim really is a star with his tempi and the grand yet muscular (though also at times ravishing) orchestral sound he gets from the Berlin Staatskapelle. So why does this recording NOT get a full 5-star report?  For some unknown reason (excepting Solti and perhaps Sawallisch - and in the case of Solti, he {with the recording director John Culshaw and Regina Resnik as Klytmnestra} were barely able to finally cajole Birgit Nilsson into finally agreeing to record the complete version!!), the cuts omitted in most or all live stage-performances keep on being excised from most recordings - and selection 3 from Disc 2 misses some lovely stuff right on the spot.  Given that the whole opera is less than two hours long, while cuts may be possibly understandable under live conditions, for recordings they're absolutely _unacceptable_!!!
