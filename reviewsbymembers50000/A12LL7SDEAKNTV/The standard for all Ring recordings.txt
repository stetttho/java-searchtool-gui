 Let's be honest:  first, one has an outstanding Wagnerian orchestra and conductor, who give this recording (without excessive playing troubles!) the sonorities needed, while allowing the music to speak for itself, never rushed nor overly slow for most tastes.  Secondly, the cast is very hard to beat overall (yes, one can fault this or that singer, but there are no major miscasts...);  and thirdly, the job done with Decca/London's engineers is utterly outstanding!  The extra effects don't get in the way, but enhance what not only is the best Ring recording period overall in itself but which also would be the ideal soundtrack to any movie made out of it!  [Yes, I could wish to see some things done differently, but it's impossible to get everything perfect, especially with a cycle of this nature!]  Definitely a must-have for all classical-music connoisseurs!!!
