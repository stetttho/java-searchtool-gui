 This is a reprint of the vocal score issued in 1935 by Universal Edition and MUSGIS Moskv.  Already there's censorship of both the music and the text present (not as severe as with the 1962 "Katjerna Izmylova" version, Op.29/114 - but still purged enough - the irony is that it still wasn't tamed enough for Stljin's tastes!).  While good as a curiosity, save your money and first buy the vocal score of the 1932 version from Hans Sikorski (especially if you can accept not having an English text - they have it in Russian and German - either way, it's still in print to the best of my knowledge) - OR wait until they publish the English text that has already been prepared for Boosey & Hawkes.
