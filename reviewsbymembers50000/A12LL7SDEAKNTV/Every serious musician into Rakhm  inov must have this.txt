 Regarding those who say that the type is too small to allow pianists to learn their parts from this version of the score:  fine, get a 2-piano version for your technical mastery of the music, BUT get this too if you want to be a real musician when learning this music.  [The same applies to singers and other instrumentalists when dealing with concerti and other such works, period - never rely only on the vocal/instrumental arrangements with piano...]  This is an excellent edition and deserves its full 5 stars!!!
