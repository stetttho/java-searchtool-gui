 A very beautiful reproduction of an older Russian edition, with clear, legible text and music.  So far, I've not found any reasons to justify the complaints issued by an Italian reviewer asking for, among other things, English translations of the sung texts (surely that would take up too much space;  furthermore, when will we accept Russian as no less valid a language as Italian, French, or German?).  So far, only good things can be said of this edition and I heartily recommend it!
