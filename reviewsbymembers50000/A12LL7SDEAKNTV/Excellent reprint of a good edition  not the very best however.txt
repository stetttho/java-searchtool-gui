 The only quibble I have with this reproduction (and it might be a personal preference) is that I like having all the instrumental abbreviations (i.e., which instruments are meant to be assigned to which staff) explicitely placed alongside each system for those staffs which are used (even if it's most or all of the players that are called-for overall that have to play on a given system).  Without those being in place, it can be difficult to be certain - for example - where is the 3rd flautist supposed to be playing the fife (piccolo) instead?  Otherwise, more than well worth having - especially at such a price!
