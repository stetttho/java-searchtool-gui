 Whoever said that this performance "sucks" and blatantly disregards/ignores the score is plain _wrong_!   To begin with, having the alto solo taken over by part of the choir-section is in all likelihood what the composer would have accepted as an 'ossia', just like he does for the tenor solo parts later on (which are quite beautifully sung, even if the sound may not be 100% idiomatic, which anyway is a matter of taste).  Secondly, the placement of the choir is indeed quite recessed, but at no point is the diction, the music or the outstanding choral sound compromised.  Thirdly, the very slowness of Shaw's interpretation (compared to the samples I tried out of Cleobury, Rostropvich, Chernushnko, Bordina, and Poljnsky) lends an air of deep mysticism to this work - and, following with the score (as well as having at least some direct knowledge of both Russian and - as in this case - old Church Slavonic) I see nothing otherwise disregarded.  Overall a matter of taste.  Sure, go ahead and get at least one of the others (in the above list), but Shaw's recording most certainly has every claim to be an equal to those overall and deserves to be in every CD library.
