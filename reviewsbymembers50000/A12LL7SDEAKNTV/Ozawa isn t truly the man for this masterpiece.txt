 There is no question about Arnold Schnberg's gigantic oratorio "Gurrelieder"'s greatness as being on the very same rarefied plane as any of mankind's other masterpieces in music (e.g., the Beethoven 9th Symphony, the High Mass in b {natural} by JS Bach, the Wagner opera "Tristan und Isolde", or Stravnskiy's ballet "Le Sacre du Printemps,") and most probably no single conductor's reading of this super-score will totally satisfy everybody.  Certainly the ingredients for a superb performance are present:  a truly great orchestra, worthy choirs for the 3rd part, wonderful soloists.  The one thing that is however missing in this recording is a truly involved conductor who can truly bare his heart on his sleeve like a Kegel or a Sinopoli - or a Stokowski.  So many, many of the really great moments of passion, tenderness, pain, and outrage (e.g., the interlude prior to the Song of the Wood-Dove) go for nothing in the hands of Seiji Ozawa - they're just brushed aside and not truly developed in terms of the eloquence and lushness this huge piece calls for.  Whatever Ozawa's greatness in Berlioz or whoever else, he almost feels mechanical in his approach - which is not what Schnberg, any more than Mahler, Wagner, Chaykvskiy, Puccini, or Richard Strauss, would have had in mind.  No, thanks to him (and it was his interpretation through which I first came to know this chef-d'oeuvre), I can't really recommend this recording almost at all.
