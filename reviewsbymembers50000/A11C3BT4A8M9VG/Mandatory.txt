 This live album is pure energy. It really is what the title suggests, a whole decade of aggression compressed into two convenient discs. How awesome is that! This album came out at just the right time. It contains songs from Show No Mercy through Seasons In the Abyss. If it came earlier, the selection would'nt be as diverse, and if it came out after another album was released, it would contain newer stuff that isn't as good. (In my opinion). Well if you have it, enjoy! and if you don't, what the hell are you doing READING about stuff so cool? You should be listening to it instead!
