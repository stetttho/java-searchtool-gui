 Anyone who says this album is where Metallica sold out is wrong. It's not a sell out, it's great, heavy music. And don't think I don't like thrash metal...I love it, but this album, and it's lyrics has something more to offer than just speed and aggression. And by the way, I don't remember Metallica ever telling you "fans" they would always play thrash metal. So don't feel all hurt and betrayed because Metallica didn't play exactly how you wanted them to on this one, that would mean you're weak. I'm not saying you have to like it either, I guess it's not some peoples style....(although you're still equally as ... for not liking such good music....). I have a feeling most of these guys saying how Metallica sold out are really young (like 13-16). A true metalhead will appreciate this type of hard rock/metal. As for the music itself, well I won't bore you with my reviewing style. I'm sure you've all heard most of these songs...that's why reviewing this is pointless.
