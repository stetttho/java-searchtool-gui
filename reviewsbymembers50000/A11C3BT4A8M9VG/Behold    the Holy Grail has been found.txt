 As any diehard Sabbath fan suspects, this album rules, and that's something someone realizes weeks before the actual release of it. The tracks on here are so raw, and really give a strong feeling to what Sabbath concerts were like in the '70s. The first disc is the previously released 'Live at Last', but it seems cleaned up, with better sound quality. It was recorded in '73 I beleive, and includes such killer tracks as "Killing Yourself To Live", "Snowblind", "Children of the Grave", and an awesome "Wicked World" medley that clocks in at 18:55. Defiantely well worth the price for just this disc alone. Then, we get an incredible second disc that's probably my favorite of the two. The tracks from Sabotage are really what takes the cake, but they are all "just grand." "Symptom of the Universe" has one of the most massive guitar tones I've ever heard (yeah, I think it's even heavier than the album version), and "Megalomania" is just insane, no other way to put it.  This could very well be the best live recording of the millenium, infact, I'm sure it is. Sure, they probably released this mainly because they needed some cash (or not, I could be wrong), but I plunked my American dollars down with pride, knowing exactly what I was about to experience.
