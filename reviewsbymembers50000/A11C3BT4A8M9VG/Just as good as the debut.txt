 That's my opinion anyways. I feel this and the debut is absolutely required in any metalheads collection. It's a shame that more people don't know of them, but don't blame me if you haven't checked these guys out because I'm telling you right here and now that they rule. Every song is awesome, ..... Overall, it's produced well, and should be turned up very loud at all times. So there you go, this album rules, get it ASAP if your a headbanger. And if your not a headbanger...well...I just don't know what to tell you... ...
