 Well, it's not really a review. I would just like to say that anyone that considers this just noise, and not music, must have a very slow mind. I'm not trying to insult anyone specifically, but for such a great thrash record, it sure has a lot of 1 star ratings from some of the worlds biggest boneheads. Every song sounds the same? Sounds like something a metal virgin would say!! It's a classic, regardless of what some 12 year-olds say.
