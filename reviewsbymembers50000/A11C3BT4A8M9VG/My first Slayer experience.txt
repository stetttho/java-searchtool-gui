 My brother came home...with a bunch of records and had some killer albums. Amoung them, Reign In Blood. I was very much into Metallica (and still am) and wanted to hear Slayer. I'd heard good things about them and some of my friends were into 'em... After it was over, I was speechless...and still am to this day! What can you say about one of the greatest metal accomplishments of all time? Also, when you buy the album these days it is expanded with Aggressive Perfector (insane version) and Criminally Insane (remix). WOW!! Talk about value!
