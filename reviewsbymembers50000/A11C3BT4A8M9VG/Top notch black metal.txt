 In a world that's filled with gay music, it's nice to know you can always depend on Enthroned. My opinion: The best black metal money can buy. It's a shame they are so underrated. I am glad in a way because it ensures that they will never sell out or compromise. This is their debut album (with the exception of the 7" Scared By Dark Winds EP) and is produced much better than early Emperor. The crown in black metal truly belongs to Enthroned. HAIL!
