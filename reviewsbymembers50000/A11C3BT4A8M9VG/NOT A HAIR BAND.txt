 I agree with pretty much every review on this album except the ones that call Skid Row a hair band. Any one who knows a damn about rock 'n' roll knows hair bands are Poison and other .... I mean Skid Row toured with Pantera and are good friends with Slayer. Well with that out of my system, I can actually review the album. If I am in a bad mood I put this CD on. It automatically puts me in a better mood. Not that it's all happy b/s! This is great for parties, or anything really. My favorite is probably "I Remember You". Bach is so good at what he does that in recent years he performs on Broadway! That alone should make you go out and buy this awesome metal debut.
