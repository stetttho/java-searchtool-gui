 This album has already become one of my favorites. Many consider it nu-metal influenced but it isn't IMO. I hate all this "nu metal" stuff, and I honestly like this CD. Sure, it's different than all the other Hypocrisy albums, but that's what makes them an exciting band. The songs are well written, and you can tell that they spent a lot of time on this one. Hypocrisy does what they want, and if they did what some of the "hardcore" fans always demand, then they wouldn't be free to do as they please.  As with all Hypocrisy releases, the production is excellent. These are some really catchy songs too, with good lyrics as well. All you really need to know is that if you consider this record a sell out, then that means you are out of touch with reality.
