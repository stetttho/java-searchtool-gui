 Personally, I find this closer to black metal than death metal, but whatever you want to call it, it's supreme in it's genre. Blessed Are The Sick, and Altars of Madness also rule, but this one is my favorite and is very technical. It's faster, more consistant, and better produced than BATS, and it has ANGEL OF DISEASE (this little ditty reminds me of a punk rock song in some parts)! OK, maybe that one's not my favorite song or anything, but it's cool.  I think they went a little downhill after this, so IMO this is the pinnacle of MA's career, and isn't laughable like so many poser bands out there. So if you want extreme, ... agression, look no further than Covenant. If you aren't into real metal, stay away.
