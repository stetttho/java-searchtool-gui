 I do not think using subtle keyboards or different guitar effects makes any album a sell out. Thats just stupid, plain and simple. Unfortunately, some of my metalhead peers feel differently (although I agree with the reviews on this site).  What we have here is Maiden STILL in their prime. Yes, I'm not going to be lame and say their good music ended in 1985, but it is safe to say this is the last classic Maiden release until Brave New World IMO. Think about it, if Maiden would have released Powerslave #2, people would label them boring, dull, running out of ideas, etc. These guys keep their music career alive with albums like this and Somewhere In Time. I understand that this album is generally considered a classic today, which is great, but upon it's release it was thought of as a sell out. Only the lame still think that.
