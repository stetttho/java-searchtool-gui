 Although quite different from their first three releses, Vol. 4 contains some of the bands best song writing. From the piano in Changes, to the raw righteousness of Snowblind, Sabbath delivers! I think this is a very well rounded album; it has something for everyone. The guitar intro in Under The Sun kind of sounds like a death metal riff. It is a very dark, heavy riff that contrasts well with the previously mentioned Changes. FX is rather odd, and isn't a song, but it's interesting. How could I not give a Sabbath record with Ozzy 5 stars? This is another classic!
