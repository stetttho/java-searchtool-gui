 This record was recorded very inexpensively, but that's the way it should be. Some might say the production sucks, but I love it. It's one of those classic records that you can keep turning up and it's sounds better and better. You know how some albums are over produced and are hard to get loud? well think aint one! Actually, this remains one of the best records EVER, 32 years later. You know Korn won't be like that in 32 years!
