 I guess there's always some people that just HAVE to complain about perfectly good things. Take this book for example; I think it's great! These guys are whining about , "oh...the answers aren't given for the review questions..." HA! Who cares? I had no problems. It's called, "understanding the concepts", and yes, you might just actually have to READ the chapters to get the concepts and info. down. After you do that then it doesn't matter how they ask the questions on the tests, because you actually understand what's going on, as opposed to just memorizing text book answers. This book provides what you need to know about Windows 2000 Pro, and getting certified. Ofcourse, the best way to learn is by listening to your instructor, taking notes, and hands on experience, but as far as books go, I have no problems with this one. And no, I don't work for the company that made this book in case you were wondering. One of my favorite parts of this book is the CD-ROM that came in the back of the book (don't know if all of them come with it though). It creates scenarios, which allow you to do labs in a simulated Win2k application. For example, it will have you set up consoles using the MMC, set up a RAS, perform administrative functions, etc. So far this book is impressive. I recommend it.
