 Kill 'Em All, Bonded by Blood, and Show No Mercy are the best metal debut albums of all time. This was my second Slayer album after RIB and ever since, Slayer has been one of my favorite bands. This is like Appetite for Destruction, in that, it means it was a great album. Pure aggression. Araya's vocals are so good on this one, just listen to those high notes!
