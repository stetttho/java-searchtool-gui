 I've owned this awesome box set for years, but never thought to review it. Metallica are so brutal live, and this collection really captures their powerful sound. I used to think the sound quality wasn't that good on the CDs, but now I really like how it sounds. You have to have relatively good speakers, and you can't turn the bass too high though. Everyone on the face of the planet should know the songs...I won't comment on them...we all know they rule. The videos are great too, but my only conplaint is the book...the pages keep falling out!! I've heard other people say that too....oh well. I haven't watched the DVD format....I haven't heard very good things about it. Why am I still yappin?! Go out and get this!!
