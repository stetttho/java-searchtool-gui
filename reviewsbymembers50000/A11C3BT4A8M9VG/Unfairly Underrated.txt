 This album is really a lot better than many give it credit for. OK, so maybe it's not my favorite Anthrax album, but it's essential in any Anthrax collection, lets just put it that way. You have to listen to it to know how cool it is, so why don't you just do that. I don't like reviewing stuff because I'm not good at it, so just buy this fun, unique thrash album.
