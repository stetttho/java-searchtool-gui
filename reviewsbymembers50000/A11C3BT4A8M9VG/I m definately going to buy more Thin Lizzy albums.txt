 Before I got this disc recently, I'd never owned a Thin Lizzy album. I wanted a good overview, and this is pretty good...I understand it doesn't feature songs from every album, but this disc is 76 minutes long, and not one song is bad. Metallica's late bassist Cliff Burton loved Thin Lizzy, and that's what made me want to check these guys out, and I couldn't be happier. This is rock at it's best! I'm going to start collecting every Thin Lizzy album, and I suggest you do the same if you haven't already.
