 I'll be the first to admit that I don't know everything there is to know about prog rock/metal, but I know for a fact these guys are the best at what they do. Some [people say] this album has no feeling, and it's "mechanical" or [something like that], hahahahaha. That's not true at all. It's not mechanical, it's precise. And it's played with a lot of feeling. That said, as you probably already know, DT is probably the most talented group of musicians in the world...no joke. Do you have any idea how hard this would be for a normal band to pull off? Impossible, I'd say. Not to mention the hooks, groove, and cool riffs they always manage to throw in. This is probably my favorite DT album yet, and if you have half a brain, you'll like this stuff too. Listen to the other guys that gave this album a good review...they probably know more about it that I do. I'm just here to confirm that this is infact a masterpiece.
