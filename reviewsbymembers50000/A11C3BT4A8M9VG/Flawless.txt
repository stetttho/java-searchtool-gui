 There are not many albums I consider "flawless", but this is an exception. The production, lyrics, vox, musicianship, etc...truly amazing! Since their debut in 1992, these guys have never put out a gay album. Each one is different, and they are all equally as good. If you like extreme metal, these guys are righteous. Definately essential!
