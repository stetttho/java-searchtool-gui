 OK, let me break it down for the more simple minded fans that might think of giving this album a 1 star rating. This is a S-O-U-N-D-T-R-A-C-K to the movie Maximum Overdrive, that's why they didn't call it a "greatest hits" record. They probably wrote the new songs to fit with the movie (it's been a long time since I've seen it). It's a must have 80's hard rock album, don't listen to people that can't grasp simple concepts.
