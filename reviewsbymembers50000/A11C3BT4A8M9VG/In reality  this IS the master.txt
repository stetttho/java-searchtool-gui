 Very cool disc. One of my personal favorites, and I just happen to be listening to it as I type this. Well, what can I say?...it's a classic and one of Black Sabbath's best. I'm sure other reviews have covered all the bases on this one so I'll just encourage you to obtain a copy as soon as possible.
