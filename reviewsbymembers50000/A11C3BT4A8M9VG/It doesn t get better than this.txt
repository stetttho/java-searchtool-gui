 There might be metal albums that equal this one's greatness, but there are none better. This is the most infamous live '80s metal album I can think of, and for good reason. It's Maiden live in their prime backing some of the best albums in history, period. The production is flawless, and with the newer re-releases of this CD, you can even get the five tracks that were not included in the original CD release. All killer, no filler, that's the best way I can think of to describe this masterpiece. Being born in 1982, this band is special to me. When I listen to '80s Maiden, I remember how we used to go over to my cousins house and they would listen to Maiden, AC/DC, Sabbath, etc. and my Mom wouldn't let me listen to it with them. I thought it was cool back then, and I think it's even cooler now. Iron Maiden will ALWAYS be a classic metal band, and no release by any band could ever think of topping the stuff they put out in the '80s.  Now if I were you, I would start collecting as much of this stuff as I could, especially with all this bland, faceless, uninspired, not to mention poser, "nu-metal" corrupting the airwaves today.
