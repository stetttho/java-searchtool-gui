 When I first heard this in '89 I went, "Holy sheep $hit!" It was the craziest metal I've heard. Since then, better bands have come along (ex. Hypocrisy) but this will always remain one of my favorite ORIGINAL albums. Altars of Madness isn't some 3rd rate, knock off, generic, immitation. This is PURE death/thrash.
