 Well, I'm sure everyone who reads this agrees that this one deserves 5 stars, except for maybe "James Hendrix". Lightning has many melodies and is pretty technical. Call of Ktulu is a very cool intrumental and sounds like it would be good to cast spells with, or something! And, you guessed it, Creeping Death is featured here. What?, you don't think I chose that name for nothing, do you? It's albums like this one, that blows Megadeth out of the water.
