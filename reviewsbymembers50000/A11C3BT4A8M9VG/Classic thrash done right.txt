 My personal favorite Slayer album because it has so much variety. The songwriting is awesome, and this showcases all of what Slayer is capable of, all on one convienient disc. This review has been kept as brief as possible for a good reason; so you won't get sick of hearing about it, so just buy it, instead of reading about it.
