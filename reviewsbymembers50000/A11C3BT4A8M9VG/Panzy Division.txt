 I know all you Megadeth fans instantly hate me. Good. I always get the feeling most of you would rather give Dave Mustaine a hand job rather than listen to good metal.  The production is still god-awfull. Dave's vocals are the annoying and pointless. Um...hello! Megadeth isn't good thrash people! I've heard every album and one work always comes to mind, panzy.  Well, now that it's out of my system I feel much better. It's always nice to comment on bands that lack anything cool. You people have a nice day.
