 ... I think this album is solid all the way though. I think Bill Wards vocals on Swinging the Chain are incredible. In fact, that's one of my favorite songs on the album. If you're a fan of good metal/rock you'll like it, don't listen to the bad thinks you've heard on the album. You don't have to be a die hard Sabbath fan to enjoy this a lot. Highly recommended!
