 This album was hard to find for me, so I'm very pleased to have purchased it recently. So far it's the only Flotsam & Jetsam album I own, but that will change because these guys tear it up. This one seems to be a fan favorite, but I can't say which one's best because I haven't heard them all. This stuff is just as good as Anthrax, Testament, and Megadeth of the same period, so that's why I'm confused as to why it's not more widely known and appreciated. Any fan of old school thrash will love this.
