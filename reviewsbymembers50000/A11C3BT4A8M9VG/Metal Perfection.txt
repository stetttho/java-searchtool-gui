 This album is perfect in every way. Back then, they had all the right ingredients. The most important one you ask? Easily, Cliff Burton. His influence is obvious on everything he appeared on. He shines on MOP and he is greatly missed. But that's not all, ALL of the other members put their heart and soul into this record and it will forever be remembered as the greatest album in metal.
