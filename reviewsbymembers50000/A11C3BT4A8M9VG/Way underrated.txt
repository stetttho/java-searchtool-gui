 It might not be the heaviest or most brutal album in the world, but II really makes the "trilogy" complete. In my opinion, Appetite, and Illusion I & II are all equally as good. Actually, I would say every G n' R album is as good as the other. It's one of those bands where you just have to have every album or else it's hard to sleep at night. That's the way it was for me anyways. (I know, that's dumb, oh well!) They were truly classic!
