 This is the best burning software I've ever used. It does everything I want it to do, and then some. I installed version 5.1 on my computer running Windows 2000 Pro, and it's run flawlwssly so far.  Windows 2000 and XP users: Like many here have already said, get the version that doesn't advertise the "Take Two" feature, and make sure the box has a blue corner that says, "enhance your Windows XP burning experience" or something like that.
