 Among the Living was the first Anthrax album I ever bought, and it is one of my favorites. Some peolpe might say it's dumb because it has songs about Judge Dredd and Stephen King, but that's part of the fun of this particular thrasher. Every song is cool, and grows on you over time. At first I liked the album, but every time I listen to it I like it more and more. It's really different than any other thrash albums like Reign in Blood or Ride the Lightning, but that's good because that means Anthrax is an original band...which I'm sure you already know if you are reading this. Bottom line: Buy this... album, you won't regret it.
