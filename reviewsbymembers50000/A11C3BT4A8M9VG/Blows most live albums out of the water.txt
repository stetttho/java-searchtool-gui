 Man, what is there left to say? I wish I would have gotten this album years ago! It's probably my new favorite live album (along with Iron Maiden's Live After Death). It makes my live Led Zeppelin albums look like jokes, and infact I've come to like Deep Purple more than Zeppelin. The energy level here is one of the highest I've ever heard...WAY better than anything out at it's time (except maybe Black Sabbath...I'll always love that band, although DP is every bit as good). Deep Purple was crazy, check them out if you haven't...this is great stuff.
