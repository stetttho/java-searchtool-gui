 I am new to Dream Theater, so I haven't heard all their stuff. But I happened to pick this up, and I think it kicks... Each of these guys are very talented at what they do. Sometimes, they sound like a cross between Rush, Metallica, and Skid Row. (All awesome bands!) I'm looking forward to getting Awake, I hear it's one of the best. Also, I think it's cool that these guys covered the entire album of MOP, live! That must have been awesome!
