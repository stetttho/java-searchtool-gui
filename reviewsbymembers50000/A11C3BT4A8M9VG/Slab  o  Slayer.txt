 Wow. That was my reaction when I first heard it in '88. Sure, it's not as blazing fast as RIB, but it kills just the same. One of my favorite songs on the album is "Cleanse the Soul". Truly classic! One of Slayer's best songs. "Spill the Blood" introduces clean guitar sounds for the first time in Slayer's career and is the one that first caught my attention on this release. So cut yourself a sizzling slab 'o' Slayer with this one!
