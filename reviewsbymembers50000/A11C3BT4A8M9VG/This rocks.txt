 I have always liked Metallica over Megadeth. But I really have to hand it to them on this album. It has some amazing guitar work and includes my favorite Megadeth song, In My Darkest Hour. Yeah, you can say it's a little cheesy, but 80's cheese is cool. Overall, this album is solid and will always remain a thrash classic.
