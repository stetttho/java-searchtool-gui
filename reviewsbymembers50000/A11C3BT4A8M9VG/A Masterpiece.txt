 This is probably my favorite Danzig album. This one has everything! Great dark lyrics, awesome guitar, and I feel Glenn's vocals are at a peak. If you are into blues metal or stuff like Black Sabbath, you will probably dig this. I would name stand out tracks for ya, but they ALL stand out, so just look at the track listing for the names of the best songs. "Let them all be cast aside..."
