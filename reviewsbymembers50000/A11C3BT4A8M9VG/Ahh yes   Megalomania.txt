 Well, here you go! Possibly Sabbath's best. But I'm not sure, I tend to say that about every one of them. This one include the mammoth song Megalomania. If you haven't heard this song, man!, do I feel sorry for you!! One of my favorite songs Symptom of the Universe is included and alone is worth the [PRICE]. Sabotage has some of the evilest sounding laughs in between Am I Going Insane and The Writ. BAD! It's records like this that make me wish I grew up in the 70s.
