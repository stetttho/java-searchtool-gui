 Wow, what a classic album! I didn't think I'd like this one as good as Beneath The Remains before I got it, but I do. In fact sometimes I like it better. A little slower than BTR, but it has more variety and rocks just as hard (and STILL plenty fast). Every track is a standout IMO, but my favorites are, 'Arise' 'Dead Embryonic Cells' 'Subtraction' and 'Desperate Cry'. The gold remastered disk that I have has four bonus tracks; Orgasmatron (Motorhead cover), Intro, C.I.U. (Criminals In Uniform), and Desperate Cry [Scott Burns Mix]. In fact C.I.U. is one of my favorites as well, and it is ashame it was left off the original release. Well, what else do I have to say to make you buy this? I'm horrible at reviewing stuff, so just buy the [...] out of this, NOW! Oh yeah, in the liner notes Max talks about his experience while recording Orgasmatron. " I remember recording it completely f'ed up," he says, laughing. "I drank half a bottle of rum before we even started. All I remember is singing the first lines, then waking up the next morning and going on tour. I asked the guys, 'did we finish the song?' and they said, 'yeah, you did the whole thing.' And I was like, 'wow, I finished the whole song?' And they kept saying, 'yeah, you did!' Then we listened and it was pretty good!"
