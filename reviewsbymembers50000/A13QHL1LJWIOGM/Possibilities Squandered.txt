   I saw this when i first came out.There was so much that could have been done comedically with the premise of this,without stooping to lowbrow slapstick (though that has it's place too). The same story could have been told in America. I thought the setting of Tokyo was,with a couple of exceptions,wasted.    I found it very difficult to get to the ending,,and I'm perfectly capable of getting through a movie where stuff doesn't get "blowed up real good" every two minutes.    But,i've always been one to make myself sit through a movie, and I'm still glad I sat through it, because my prediction of "we're going to see a lot more of Scarlet Johansen" appears to be coming true.
