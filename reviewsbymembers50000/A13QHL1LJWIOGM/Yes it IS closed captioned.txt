  Since I originally wrote this,I have purchased and viewd Season 3 CSI,and like everybody told me,I loved it.Still think the menus are a little lame,but the menus aren't the meat.I think a special feature on a real-life crime scene analyst would be something neat to see.    Now..about those subtitles...I,like many of you,simply cannot comprehend the abscence of them in this day and age.    I'm sure the vast majority of you already know this, but there seems to be a couple of people who claim they can't find the closed captioning on the DVD. That's because you have to use the closed-captioning on your TV.It's encoded in the DVD itself,but you won't find it in the options.Just turn on the close captioning on your TV. It has long been a law that televisions manufactured for sale within the US have close-captioning ability. I'm not sure if this applies to stand-alone monitors (Ie,flatpanels,LCD's, plasma screens,etc) but unless your TV set is really,really old,it should have CC capabilities. However,even if I were hearing-imparied,I would much prefer the subtitles. So much cleaner and less obstrusive!(and usually more accurate)
