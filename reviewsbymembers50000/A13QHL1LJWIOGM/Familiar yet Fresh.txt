 I find the "indie-chick-newage-folk-rock" tag used the the Amazon review to be rather fitting.This CD just picks up momentum as it goes along.There are some interesting moments along the way.David Bell's Spanish-style guitar solo in "The Seed" adds a nice flavour. The solo is perhaps a little too loud in the mix,but I'm sure the guitarist isn't complaining!     Things start off nicely enough.Then Kerry kicks it up a notch with the Byrds-esque jangle and upbeat tempo (not to mention the stick-in-your-head chorus) of Comin' Home.Rounding things out are 3 more uptempo songs,with "Take Me Somewhere" being the rocker of the bunch,which also features an electric solo from Monsiuer Bell,on which he does a fine job for a self- admitted "not a rock soloist",which means the solo fits the song.    Things get mellow again with the title track,which closes out the album,and where the new-age influence definitly show through.Kerry's voice sounds (to my ears anyway) like a cross between Joni Mitchell,Edie Brickell, a just a dash of a non-annoying Alanis Morisette,but ulimatly she sounds like....Kerry Rutherford.Who in a vast sea of faceless,commercial music,has set afloat a buoy of originality.
