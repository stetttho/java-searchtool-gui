 Don't get me wrong, I LOVE The Simpsons,and greatly enjoy the Halloween episodes,and I can't wait until it arrives in my mailbox.Finally, I'll get to see "Homer" with a clear picture (as opposed to the grainy one I taped off TV so many eons ago) My one star is for FOX.They initially said Season 5 of the Simpsons would be out by now.Perhaps this Treehouse of Horror DVD was a way of trying to make up for it a little (or bilk us out of more money, take your pick), but FOX ISN'T EVEN PROMOTING IT! No store in my area has it, and people look think I'm making it up when I ask for it. I tried 2 national chains,and nobody knows what I'm talking about! How can people buy your product if nobody knows it's out there?        If you've found tis page, then you obviously know it's out there. If you're wondering about buying it...well..you must be a Simpsons fan, or you wouldn't be staring at these reviews,right? If you enjoy their yearly Halloween escapades, then go for it!Some of the best are to be found here.I wouldn't reccomend it for those who are easily grossed out. Though it's exaggerated cartoon violence, some people can't seem to grasp the fact that they're only drawings! No actors were harmed in the making of these episodes. (well..then again..we ARE talking about FOX here). So grab a bag full o' Halloween candy (mmmm...free candy),stuff yourself silly, have a scare, and laugh your hairy yellow ... off! (You'll probably have to order it from right here at Amazon, as nobody else seems to be aware that it even exist)
