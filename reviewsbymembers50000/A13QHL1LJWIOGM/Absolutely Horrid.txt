 This is NOT a good DVD for beginners..or anyone else. Like others have said,it's just a taped Capoeira class,with no explanation of how to do any of the techniques. I would be willing to buy a DVD of justa Capoeira demonstration if it was advertised that way,and if the camerawork was professional. Some of the Capoeristas on the program are very good,but it's not worth the money. I got this and the advanced Capoeria dvd for FREE with another order I placed, and I STILL feel ripped off! Avoid at all cost..unless that cost is free.
