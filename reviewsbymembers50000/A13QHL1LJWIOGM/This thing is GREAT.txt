 I've noticed a couple of people have had issues with the moon phases display,and I had the same confusion myself when I first got it, but it DOES correctly display the phases correctly! When the display is fully black, it's a new moon.When there is nothing in the phase display, it's a full moon. It makes sense once you get used to reading it.  The only "problem" I have had with this is having to replace the batteries in the clock and transmitter every 6 to 8 months. For that reason, I highly reccomend a quality battery. (I'm partial to Duracell myself). And I have no beef with having to place the OUTDOOR tempature sensor OUTDOORS to get an OUTDOOR tempature reading. I would think the phrase "outdoor sendor" might be a clue! Anyway the outdoor sesnor works fine, and is always within 1 or 2 degrees of the local news or online reports.  As far as the clock itself, it's great having the correct time (almost) all the time. I say "almost" because every once in a while it will lose the radio signal, and it will display the wrong time and year. Leave it alone and it will usually correct itself within a couple of hours.  If it's not against amazon policy, you'll now see a link to the official U.S. time http://www.time.gov/timezone.cgi?Eastern/s/-5/java The link will show you Indiana time, but you can change your time zone once you get there.Indiana will begin to illegally observe DST next spring. (illegal because we, the citizens, did not get to vote on it)Anyway, about that link, once you get the clock set up, it's almost always perfectly synced with the time displayed on the link. Trs cool!!:D
