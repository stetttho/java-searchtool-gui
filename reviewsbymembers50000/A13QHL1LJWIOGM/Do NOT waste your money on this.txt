 (1 star because they won't let me vote negative 5!)This 2 DVD set is WAY overpriced for what it is. I got both of them for free when I ordered the entire series from Panther (A much better series,though this art pretty much requires 1-on-1 instruction). I'm glad I got them for free, because I would have felt extrememly gipped otherwise.    They name some thechinques, but no explanation is given on how to do them. The camera work looks like it was shot on a handheld 8mm. All in all, they're just taped Capoeria classes with no instruction. I will admit, when you CAN see through the grainy picture,some of the Capoeristas are very good,but not good enough to warrant the proce of this poorly shot and produced jump-on-the-bandwagon peice of garbage.
