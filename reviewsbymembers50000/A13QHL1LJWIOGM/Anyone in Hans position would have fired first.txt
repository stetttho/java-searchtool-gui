 Okay, of course I haven't seen the DVD's yet, so the 5 star rating is simply because it's Star Wars.(Well..it USED to be Star Wars) SOME of the retouches I don't mind (IE: It always drove me nuts that you could see the cells around the spaceship models in ANH). But some are just there because ILM is saying "Look what we can do!" (The most obvious,and obnoxious case of this being Jar Jar Binks).    Now,I'm not sitting down with the tape here, so I might not get the dialouge exactly right, but I know I'll get the gist of it enough to demonstrate that Han Solo was justified in shooting first. GREEDO: "Perhaps I can take you to Jabba myself" SOLO: "Over my dead body" GREEDO:"I was hoping you would say that.I've been looking forward to this for a long time!"    There! Now, in the same situation,wouldn't YOU fire first. Granted, Han was preparing his balster as soon as Greedo sat down, but can you blame him?It's one scene that needed NO tampering with! It just doesn't look right.
