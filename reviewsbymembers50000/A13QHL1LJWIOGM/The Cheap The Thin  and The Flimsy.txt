 Ok..5 stars for the the season itslef, despite a couple of clunkers (hey..not sayin' I could do better). as far as the hollowed out human head packaging, I really don't mind, except that, as others have mentioned, it's really thin, flimsy packaging. I take pretty good care of my stuff, so i don't see this as being a problem for me. And the flod out book which contains the discs themselves is actually pretty nice.   I do have one major gripe with this and season 5, and that's you can't turn the subtitiles on "on-the-fly".Every now and then, I'm sure a line gets by that we can't quite make out. On the past couple of Simpsons DVD's, you have to go through about 3 or 4 steps each time to turn the subtitles on and off. One thing they did right this time,however, is many of the songs actually have the lyrics subtitled, instead of just saying "singing". (On the past disc, you could still get the lyrics by using the closed captioning on your TV set).   So, let's get it right, FOX!! (THERE'S some wishful thinking!) Subtitles on demand, and if you insist on carrying on the human head idea, at least make quality human heads!
