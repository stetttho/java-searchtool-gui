 Ah...season 4..I can't believe it was 12 years ago, yet how clearly I remember these episodes! A testement to the growth of the show.    There's not much I can say here that hasn't already been said..funny episodes,great video transfer,quicker menu/load times,etc. About all I can add is it has the sweetest surround sound mix of any of the Simpsons DVD sets.(I also share the complaint of it taking so long to get these things out).    So..you must be a Simpsons fan if you're reading this. Well, stop reading and buy it now!:)
