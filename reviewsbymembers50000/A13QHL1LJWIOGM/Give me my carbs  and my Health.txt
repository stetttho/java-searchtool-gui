 High protein, low carb diets are nothing new. In fact, they've gone in and out of vouge since approximately the 1860's. They SEEM to work at first, because one does lose weight. The trouble is, this type of eating puts the body into a state called Ketosis, which basically means the body is unable to properly metabolize fat, due to a lack of carbohydrates! So it starts feeding off of muscle tissue for energy.    Carbs are needed to metabolize fat for energy, and without the proper amount of carbs,you will tire out more quickly when exercising than someone who has an adequate carb supply.In fact,the human body needs on average about 300 grams of carbohydrates a day. 60 grams a day are needed just to maintain proper nervous system function.The simple carbohydrates found in fruits and vegetables are quickly used by the body. Complex carbs,found in starchy foods,are stored in the body until needed for energy.If they aren't called on for energy,you gain weight.     Much of the weight lost on a low carb diet is water weight (mostly from muscle). In fact, for every two pounds lost on a high carb diet, 1 pound of it is muscle! Hardly a good trade off for anyone.     If you're considering this type of diet, consider this instead..eat less, do more! In fact, I lost 20 pounds in two months simply by doing more and eliminating fast food.(I've maintained the same bodyweight for the past 7 years, even though I've had fast food for lunch every day. How is this possible? Activity level!)The only other change I made to my diet was cutting back to one soda a day and drinking water, fruit juice, or a sports drink the rest of the day. But there would have been no way I could keep up my activity level by robbing my body of carbohydrates.  If you're obese (or even if you're not),see your doctor about and exercise/diet program. It's better to lose a pound every week or two than to lose it too rapidly. (People who lose it rapidly often put it back on).That may seem like a slow way to go about losing it-and it is-but it's simply not worth the risk to your health for a quick fix. (and didn't Dr. Atkins die from heart attack?)        Eat Less/Exercise: Good        Ketosis: Bad!
