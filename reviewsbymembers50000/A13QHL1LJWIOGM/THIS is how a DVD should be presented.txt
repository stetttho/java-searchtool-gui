 What can I say? Surely everyone who's fan of the genre has seen the movie several times by now. But the picture is perfect, and the 5.1 surround just RIPS and puts you right in the middle of the action. Many DVD's make rather dissappointing use of surround sound.They need to give this a listen to see how it should be done. My only gripe is the lack of separate French and Spanish language tracks,so I still have the rugular version of the T2 DVD. Languge students take note,DVD's are a great (someimes VERY frustrating) tool for the intemediate student on up,though I'm sure many have discoverd that by now.(And those dreadful Pokmon cartoons are much more tolerable with an alternat language track). But as for T2..Listen to me now and hear me later and understand a coupl of weeks ago in the not too distant future..if you don't have the T2 Ultimate Edition DVD, you are quickly relenquishing your right to claim yourself as a fan of the film! (As for Star Wars and Indy Jones, right now I would be as happy as a pig in...uh..you know..for movie-only versions with 5.1 on DVD!!)
