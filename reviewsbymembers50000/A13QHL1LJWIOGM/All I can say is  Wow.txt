  Finally we have a concert DVD with decent video editing!None of that MTV cut-every-2-seconds garbage.(To be fair,Scenes from a Memory wasn't too bad about the video editing). The camera actually focuses on the band members long enough that you can see them do their thing.   And many times,as they're doing their thing,you'll find yourself shaking your head in disbelief and going wow.Especially during the many hyper-speed guitar solos that Jordan Rudess matches note-for-note on the keyboards. These guys are ridicuously good! And the 5.1 mix is fantasic for about the first 3/4 of the show. It's still good after that,but someone should have caught that before it got out. Much to my delight/chagrin, John Petruccis guitar is mixed dominant in the right rear speaker,every note comes through loud and clear. (Guitarist know exactly what I mean by the delight/chagrin comment;)    I know a lot of people complain about James LaBrie,but I've never really had a problem with his voice.At least he sings on key. He's more animated here than on previous releases,where it looked like he was just there to do his job. On this one,it sounds like he's getting vocally tired towards the end of the show.Then he coms back in full voice for the encore.    The extras are very good too.Especially the documentary and the multi-angle of "Instrumedley".    Unless your offended by instrumental profinciency, just get this!
