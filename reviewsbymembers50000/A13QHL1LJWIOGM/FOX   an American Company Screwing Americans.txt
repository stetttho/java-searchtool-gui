 If it were not for the Simpsons,(which appeared to be on a rebound last season)I wouldn't even give FOX the time of day.Here we have a great show like Futurama,that they never gave a fair shot,pre-empted ad-infintum,and now we're bludgeoned with garbage like (insert titile of reality show you hate the most here.)    Thankfully, they've gotten these DVD sets out more quickly than the Simpsons. Though Europe had Season 4 of Futurama quite sometime ago (way to screw the Americans over,FOX!!)     Okay,okay..I'll stop being grumpy now..because I WAS quite elated to see this in my recommendations!:D:D There's really not much I can say that wasn't covered in the Amazon review. You probably already know you like it,so whaddaya waitin' for? (how many other shows could actually get away with several visualizations of sh**ting a brick?) Stop reading. Buy (or pre-order) now.
