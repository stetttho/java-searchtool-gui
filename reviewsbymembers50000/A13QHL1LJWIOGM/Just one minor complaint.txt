 Love the series.In fact,I had forgotten how funny it was (since FOX hardly ever showed it!!) But I was very,VERY dissapointed in the sound.First I was dissapointed because there is no 5.1.Not a big deal,as they did provide Dolby Surround,or so I thought. But even in that,there's not a lot of seperation between left and right,and a lot of times,the music is coming out of the center speaker!C'mon!Even The Simpsons Season 1 had a better sound mix than this!  Like I said,it's just a minor complaint,which hopefully will be rectified by season 2. Fellow tone freaks will understand.But I've updated this to 5 stars because,even though I still am disappoinrted over the sound,that's nor reason to knock a star off this funny,funny series given the shaft by FOX.(Booooo FOX!!)
