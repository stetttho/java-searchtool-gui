 First, I want to say that I really,REALLY have liked this movie for sometime now. If this were the only version available, I probably would have given it 3-1/2 stars. But when you pay over 30 bucks for a DVD, you expect lots of bells and whistels and shiny things. But today I just happened to check out the back of the regular DVD in a Dept. store. The Criterion version only has audio in 2 channel stereo. If that's what the film was originally recorded in, fine. But, it has since been remixed (as have many titles for DVD) in English 5.1, which is available on the Dept. store release for half the price. But thqt's not allllll you get!! Also for half the price, you get French AND Spanish, both in 5.1 surround. For thjose who speak neither language-or who don't have a surround sound system-it's probably no big deal. The thing that originally attracted me to DVD's was the separate language tracks. It takes away from text-book boredom, and you get to hear how the languages are truly spoken. Even if the detp-store version only had English, I would still be miffed by the fact that it's in 5.1,whilst the Criterion version only has stereo (those who are finicky about sound will understand). While the picture quality is superb..and okay..the audio isn't THAT bad..the "extras" really aren't that good.Maybe for film students and really hardcore fans. It was neat to see the "deleted scenes" via the story board, but on the whole, this particualr DVD is wayyyyy overpriced for what you get. I thougt "The Rock" from the Criterion Collection was great, so I was expecting the same of this.I learned the hard way to research,research,research before purchase!And despite the claim of additional footage, it's exactly the way I remember it,(and I've seen it al least 2-4 times a year before I got the DVD).Maybe I missed somthing (or we've all become desensitized to squibs and gunfire in the years since it's initial release).
