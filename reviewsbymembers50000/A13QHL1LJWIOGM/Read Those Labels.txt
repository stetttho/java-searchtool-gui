 I was taken by the "Now Ephedrine Free" label. I took as per label directions,(1 capsule after meals,3 times a day)taking the last around 6pm. I could not sleep at all that night. I looked at the smaller print on the back  and this containd 200mg of caffiene per pill! I am not hypersensitive to caffeine (thank goodness) but nobody needs this amount of a stimulant in their system.(Mountain Dew,by comparison,has 45 mg per 12 oz serving).    I have since been using a tried and true method for weight loss..eat less,do more!
