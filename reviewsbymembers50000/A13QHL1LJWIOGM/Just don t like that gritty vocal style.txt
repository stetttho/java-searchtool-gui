 Don't get me wrong,I think Ripper Owens is doing a stellar job as Halford's replacement,I just never liked gritty vocal styles in general,which is really just a matter of ones preference.Though it kind of makes me cringe because I know how hard on the vocal chords it is,and I would like to see Mr. Owens have as long a career as the rest of Priest already have.    But enough academics,this is Heavy Metal!!When Ripper hit's those smooth tones or rips those high notes,look out!I had forgotten how much I liked "Desert Plains" unitl I watched this.And I agree with another reviewer here when they ask why "The Sentinal" was left out of the set list.They do it in soundcheck,but only half of it!      So for that,and a gritty vocal style (which again,is a matter of personal preferance) I knock off a star.(Well,1.1% of the star knocked off because of grit,the other 98.9% because of The Sentinal fiasco.   I was gong to knock off becasue I thought the guitars sounded a little thin,but hey!It's live for goodness sakes!And besides,I'd have to add back on because the 5.1 really fills out the room nicely!Groups are really beginning to take advantage of Surround-sound,and so far this is one of the best concert 5.1 mixes I've heard!(wow,when did Judas Priest get a bassist?!)      Anyway,the bottom line is I would highly reccomend this to any fan!Even those who have sworn them off since Halford's departure,TAKE A LOOK (and a listen,of course) AT THIS!
