 I'll get right to the point, these episodes are even funnier than Volume 1! Just buy it already!    Having said that, I have a couple of beefs. They already have season 3 (possibly 4) on DVD in Europe. While on the West side of the pond, we just got season 2?!!(I could be wrong, but I think the European DVD's have a 5.1 audio option as well).    But here's the thing that got to me. During one of the audio commentaries, somebodty said "as we watch this, it's 2001". They recorded the commentaries TWO YEARS AGO,and we're just now getting the DVD's?! *Homer voice, shaking fist*-I hate FOX so much!! Here yhey had a good show that they barely gave a chance. Then they cancelled it while trying to shove dross like (Insert reality show title here) on us. Once they lose the Simpsons, they can bite my shiny metal...um....enough of my griping, this is supposed to be a review.So here it is recapped in a nutshells cap: Great picture,(some gorgeous 3D animation),a few entertaining commentaries,and the best cigar- stoking/booze-guzzling/foul-mouthed robot ever!(Did I mention even more funny than season one?!) Fill out the neccessary forms and buy it already,mon!
