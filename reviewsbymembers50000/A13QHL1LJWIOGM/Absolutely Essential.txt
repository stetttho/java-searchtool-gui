 What can I say that hasn't already been said?One of the best-if not THE best TNG episodes ever.Even if you're a casual sci-fi fan,I'd wager that you'll really like this one. Of course,if you know the history leading up to the episode,and the repercussions that come if future episodes,that makes it even better!!I cannot wait until these seasons are out on DVD!!
