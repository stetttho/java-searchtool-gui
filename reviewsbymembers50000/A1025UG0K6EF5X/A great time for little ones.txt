 I have a 4.5 year old and he is a HUGE Jeffrey fan!  He knows the words to the songs and it really gets him dancing and clapping.  Our favorites are the Bossy Frog song and the Airplane song.  This guy really knows how to relate to kids.  Everyone in our family loves Jeffrey - we would give him more stars if possible!
