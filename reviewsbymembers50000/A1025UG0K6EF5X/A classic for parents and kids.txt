 I think this book is sweet and it brings across the message of unconditional love.  Those reviewers that talk of it being creepy or weird at the end need to be reminded that it is fiction and is written for kids.  I think the author is trying to drive home the message that your parents will love you FOREVER not just when a child is little.  I find the end interesting - it becomes the child's turn and I like that.
