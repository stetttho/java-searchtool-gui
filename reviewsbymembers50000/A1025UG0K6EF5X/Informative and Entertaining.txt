 First of all, this book is worth its weight in gold just for the brisket recipie alone! (try Haina's Sure-fire Brisket - its easy and super!)  Not only does this book have a great variety of multi-ethnic recipies, but it has interesting sections on different aspects of New York cooking.  It's a great read and has super recipies. Also, Catherine Hepburn's brownies are fabulous and Carrot Top carrot cake will make a carrot cake lover out of anyone!
