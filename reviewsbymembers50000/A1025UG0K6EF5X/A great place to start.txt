 I found the audio cassette and book very informative but there was little information that I did not already know.  I found this to be a very broad overview and did not provide any in-depth information. I do give it 4 stars because it is very clear and consise.  The author and panelists explain SI in a very easy to understand way.  I had already read "The Out of Sync Child" and I wish it had been the other way around.  I found "The Out of Sync Child" a little difficult to read at times and I think that if I had listened to and read this tape and book first, then I would have had an easier time with the other. In a nutshell, I highly recommend this book/tape as a "jumping off" point for understanding Sensory Integration Disorder.
