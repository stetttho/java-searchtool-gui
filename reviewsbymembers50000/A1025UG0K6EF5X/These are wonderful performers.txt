 I originaly found a different set of CD's by Sharon, Lois and Bram for just $3.00 and my son LOVED them.  This CD is extra nice because it has not  just Chanukah songs but general songs about winter.  My mom loves Old King  Cole.  It's a great CD - great for the kids but sophisticated enough to not  drive the adults crazy.  Heck - I love it!
