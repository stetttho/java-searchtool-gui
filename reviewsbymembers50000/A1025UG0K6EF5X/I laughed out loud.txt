 I took this book with me on a vacation and I read part of it on the airplane and I laughed so hard at some points that I know other passengers were looking at me.  I found this book to be truly delightful.  I was sad to come to the end because it was so enjoyable.  I have since loaned it to several friends, all of them enjoyed it as much as I did.  I can't wait to read Ms. Cohen's new book, Much Ado About Jesse Kaplan!  Enjoy!
