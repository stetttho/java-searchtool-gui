 My friend gave this to my son because it is a favorite in her house.  This is a great toy!  This toy has sparked such creative play enthusiasm in my son like I have never seen before.  Ernie and Elmo take turns driving the sub to all kinds of places and he also uses this toy in conjuction with other bath toys (like boats).  I HIGHLY recommend this toy for kids 2 and up.
