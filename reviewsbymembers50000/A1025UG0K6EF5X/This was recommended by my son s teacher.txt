 Before holidays or birthdays, I ask my son's pre-school teacher what toys he should have.  One of the first things she recommended was Barnyard Bingo.  Boy, was I glad she did!  Ben (3.5 yrs) loves this game!  He has been playing with it since he was about 2.5 years old and he can stick with it for a long time.  I found the game to be very sturdy, I just make sure we have all of the pieces before putting the toy away.  This game is a great first game - it teaches turn taking, colors, and matching.
