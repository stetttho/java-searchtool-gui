 All of Mr. Crews' books are favorites in our house...so it is no suprise that my son, Ben (3), loves this one too!  I am buying another copy for my girlfriend's children.  I think this man is one of the best authors/illustrators of children's books around.  He has a way with beautiful pictures and simple verses that are so pleasing for young children.  This book is a little different from his others because of the sliding pages but it only adds to the charm.  This book is a winner!  Also, check out Freight Train, Flying and School Bus by Donald Crews as well, you won't be disappointed!
