 This book is essential for any holiday family traditions.  Ms. Nathan not only shares some wonderful recipes (try the Orange Chicken - it's easy, fun and OUT OF THIS WORLD!......) but she also shares her family's traditions and give you wonderful ideas to enhance your own celebrations.  My family loves this book and we refer to it on a regular basis. I would give it more stars if I could!....
