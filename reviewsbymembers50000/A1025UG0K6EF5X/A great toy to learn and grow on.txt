 My son got this as a gift and he loves it!  It is a great toy to start out as just a drawing board for the very young and as the child gets older, add  the spirograph part.  I would say that my 3 year old plays with it at least  2-3 times a day.  He can indulge in his artistic side and I do not need to  worry if he is writing on the walls (floors - yes floors).
