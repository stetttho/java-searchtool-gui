 My 4.5 year old son loves this album in the car!  He is a HUGE Jeffrey fan and I think this is his favorite album.  Our favotites are Snortin Nortin, Everybody Loves Grandma,and Something Smells (its my nose).  The last one sends my son into fits of laughter.  Jeffrey really understands kids and seems to have the ability to reach them through his music.  WE LOVE JEFFREY!
