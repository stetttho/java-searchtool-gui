 Miranda Lee will not be winning any major literature prizes any tine soon, but for what this book is, it's great.  This book moves along quickly - gets to the point without the plot or character development being too flimsy.  I do keep a look out for Ms. Lee's books - so I guess you could say I am a fan of sorts. This book takes place in Australia (as have all of the other Lee books I have read in the past) and involves the lifestyles of the very wealthy.  If you have enjoyed Ms. Lee's previous books, or you enjoy the short romance formula, you will certainly enjoy this book!
