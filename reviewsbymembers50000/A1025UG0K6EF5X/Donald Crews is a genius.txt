 I highly recommend all of Mr. Crews' books.  He writes in a style that is very easy for toddlers and pre-schoolers to relate to.  Furthermore, his illustrations are positively delightful!  However, I recommend this book even more because it was instrumental in easing my son's fear of flying and airplanes.  I bought this book and read it to him before our airplane trips and I take it on the airplane and read it to him there as well.  As the plane is in the various stages of flight, I show him that part of the book.  I am not kidding, we went from a toddler who had to be carried on to the plane kicking and screaming to a kid that is excited about airtravel!
