 My son, now 3, loves this album!  He also loves the Wiggles videos.  This has been a favorite of his for about a year now.  His favorites are:Get Ready to Wiggle, Rock-A-Bye Your Bear, We're All Friends, Little Brown Ant, Dorothy's Birthday Party, Henry the Octopus, Lechoo Yeladim and Whenever I Hear This Music.  This is great for the car as well at home.  It's great music that does not make the adults go nuts while listening to it!
