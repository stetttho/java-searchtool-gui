 An outstanding Third Person Shooter with excellent graphics, sound , and gameplay! It truly feels like playing a light-hearted version of HALO, complete with awesome vehicle use and melee attacks! Also it has a great story with excellent voice work.  I try very hard to take shooters on their own merits, but the similarites to HALO are uncanny. This game is chalked full of spastic running and gunning against various butt-kicking, smart enemy A.I. that works together well. But don't worry because you'll have help from friendly A.I. fighting beside you. However you must either keep yourself as a fast moving target or use the cover provided by the large, beautiful levels (or maybe alittle of both) to stay alive. The vehicles are original and handle well. This is a very challenging and entertaining shooter. The multi-player format (like HALO) provides for hours of replay. For it's bargain price you really don't have a good reason to, at the very least, not rent or buy this game. Metal Arms is one of the most enjoyable shooters I have ever played!
