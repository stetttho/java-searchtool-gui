 If you can get past the fact that your not doing the shooting, you will love this strategic command of an infantry squad! This is very realistic and intense video game combat. You will take control of a basic infantry squad, having the ability to assign sectors of fire, control team formations, and have access to battle field assets such as indirect fire support and air recon intel. The interaction of the individual soldiers responses are just hilarious (and realistic from my experience). The over all graphics and cut-scenes are just awesome. I almost feel like I'm playing the "Black Hawk Down" movie, the combat is intense and almost seems like combat file footage. My only small complaint with this game is that (I don't believe) there is not a way to move all of your fire teams at once in a standard squad formation. Overall, this is simply an awesome military game!
