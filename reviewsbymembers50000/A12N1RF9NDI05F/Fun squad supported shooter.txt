 First off, yes you can manually aim at targets (some other reviewers didn't play the game long enough) also there is an excellent auto-targeting system. Made by the same people who did Hitman 2 (another excellent game), Freedom Fighters brings to the table awesome firefights in very detailed environments. The sound and music is excellent bringing back memories of watching "Hunt for Red October" and "Red Dawn". The game begins as a third person shooter, but soon evolves into your strategic command of a small band of fighters. You will dominate the battle field and slaughter the soviets, however their Hind attack helicopters are unstoppable and rain death on your troops. As shooters go, this one has a very good story told mostly by soviet news propoganda. In all this game has good enemy and friendly A.I., excellent weapons, great looking, large level maps, and addictively satisfying gameplay. This is an excellent squad shooter!
