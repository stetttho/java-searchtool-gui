 A fun platformer designed for the younger gamer, but challenging enough to kept most adults interested. If you enjoyed the 1970's Hobbit cartoon you'll like this game. The cut scene movies are great, but are almost ruined by the story telling of the book pages between levels. The ending is a bit anti-climatic and does not do justice to the book (or even the great 70's cartoon movie). In all it is a solid platformer and most levels are challenging.
