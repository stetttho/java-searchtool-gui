 This is by any means not in contention to be a Game of the Year, still I found it a fun distraction game. Unlike some of the reviewers, I have actually played the game (and no I'm not trying to sell a copy). This is the type of game that the average gamer will beat in a day or two, so you might want to rent before your buy. Because of it's bargain used price range I went ahead and took a chance on buying it.  The Scorpion King has graphics that could be compared to a great PSOne title quality. I thought the level maps looked good, but were small and character movement is the old, slightly jerky motion with moderately detailed models. This game is a button mashing fighting adventure that tries to make use of an average combo using, combat system. Enemy AI is moderate and serves it's purpose, groups of enemies strike in mass. Enemies vary from swordsmen, guard dogs, giants (the average NBA player), to trolls and archers. The bosses look pretty good in this game and require alittle puzzle solving to defeat (like your average Zelda boss). I find it to be a fun change of pace from some of my more intense games. It's not great but it's worth atleast a weekend rent.
