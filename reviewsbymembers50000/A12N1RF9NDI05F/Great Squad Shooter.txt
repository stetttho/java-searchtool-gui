 I have owned all three ports of this game, and honestly this is my least favorite. However, I still love this title. The GC version has slightly more akward controls than it's rivals, AI is still just as solid. The squad based mission orders are controlled by a basic, easily learned control format. Weapons are somewhat realistic but you are required to find weapons caches for ammo and guns, a big disappointment to gamers used to picking up and using the enemy's weapons. Multiplayer (UP to 4) cooperative is awesome for this game! Requires some thought and don't forget to take cover, for me this game is more enjoyable than Ghost Recon or Navy SEALS. Love this game!!!
