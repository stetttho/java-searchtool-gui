 This game got alot of things right, but missed on some of the small elements that gamers have come to expect from this generation of gaming. First off let me state that very few gaming moments have made me feel like a total bad-ass (and a dork, all at the same)! Hanging off the running-boards of a Little Bird helicopter while sniping suckers on the ground was just awesome! Other great moments were manning the mini-guns on a Black Hawk (WE NEED MORE LEVELS LIKE THIS!!!) and convoy ground turret missions (but why only a 50cal., why no Mark-19 40mm grenade launcher).   In all Black Hawk is a solid First Person Shooter. There is an excellent weapon lay-out, however some missions are limited on choices; this is a mistake in my opinion. My only real gripe with the game's mechanics are the player's interaction with enemy combatants and civilians. For instance every Somolian with an AK-47 is an expert sniper, however the only thing MY D-Boys and Rangers can hit is me (over, and over, and over again, in the back of the head every time). My second point on this issue is the inadequate squad command interface; half the time it is unavailable, the other half it is unresponsive. My only other real concern is that I could not kill civilians or other background characters. I DON'T WANT TO, it's just that it removed a major element of realism for me when a stray shot has no effect.   In all I enjoyed completing the campaign in a weekend, I didn't have the opportunity to try the co-op though. The graphics were alittle less polished than what I was expecting, and I didn't get the feeling of the overwhelming odds faced by the men who were faced with the real-life hell. What I got was a good Medal of Honor style game with slightly clunky control that was fun but left me wanting just a bit more.
