 Think up a cross between Splinter Cell's Sam Fisher and the aggressive firefights of Conflict: Desert Storm and what you would get is Kill.Switch! I'll be perfectly honest, this is not a game that I would be quick to drop fifty bucks on, but is an excellent rental or one to scoop up at the thirty-five or lower price range. Those who appreciate a good shooter will love this one! Gameplay is very realistic and difficult, sound and graphics are great! This is how video game combat should be, grenade a room with a frag or flash bang then come in spraying! I have found the enemy A.I. to be very challenging, attacks are very coordinated using covering fire and flanking movements. Another big plus this games got going for it is the re-use of enemy rifles (I hate it when you can't pick up the guy's gear that you just shot). Character movement is the only real problem I have with this game. The character looks great and can combat roll but looks sluggish when running, but when this is the only problem you've got an awesome shooter! You'll love it when you're running for you life from the first attack helicopter you encounter! I have never been required to use the environment so much to stay alive, it's an awesome game element and I'm shocked that no one has done this before; thumbs up to you Namco!
