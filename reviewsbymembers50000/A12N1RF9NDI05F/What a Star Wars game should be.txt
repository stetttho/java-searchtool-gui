 This is the best ground combat Star Wars game to date! This is not a game with a richly detailed story like "Knights of the Old Republic". "Battlefront" is instead designed to be an awesome multi-player online experience, but thankfully the solo player has not been neglected. This game is far from perfect, however it is not so seriously flawed as to be doomed to the bargin bin.  NEGATIVES: 1. Friendly AI are stupid; acting mostly on their own, they will frag you and themselves as much as the enemy will. 2. There is no choice of view while in a vehicle or spacecraft. 3. Jedi are non-playable, support characters and can not be killed! 4. Aircraft cannot fly very high and are severly limited by most map sizes. 5. Squad commands are basically useless in the solo campaigns.  POSITIVES: 1. The graphics and sound are beautiful and worthy of the movies! 2. The ground combat is solid with excellent control setup. 3. The battlefields are massive engagements filled with large forces slugging it out for control of key locations on many planets. 4. Many excellent choices of troop types and vehicles, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. 5. Split screen, linked systems, online playing: what ever your choice, multi-player is just an awesome experience! 6. Very little story in campaign, however there are excellent perks like DVD clips from the movies and unlockable movie stills and artwork. 7. You can chose to drive/fly a vehicle or just be a gunner!  Like I said already, this game does have minor flaws, but they will not over shadow the pure enjoyment this game brings as a shooter! "Star Wars: Battlefront" is on par as a ground combat game to Nintendo's "Star Wars: Rouge Squadron" series as a flight game. Regardless if your an online player or not, this is one of the best Star Wars games ever!
