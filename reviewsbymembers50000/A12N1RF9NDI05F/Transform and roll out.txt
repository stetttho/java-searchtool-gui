 Gameplay is solid, but nothing ground breaking. Very good graphics and sound, controls are dependable. The levels are vast, detailed land scapes filled with challenging enemies. I'm not a big fan of the mini-con concept in the new cartoon show, but it has actually proven to be a very positive element of the game-play. This game does the franchise justice, the tranforming is executed beautifuly in sound and look. You'll love it when you ram a decepticon in vehicle mode, then transform to finish him off. Overall this is an excellent game!
