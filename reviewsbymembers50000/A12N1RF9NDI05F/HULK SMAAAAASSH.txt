 Game play is a continuation of the events that take place after the movie. The graphics are great, the attacks are just incredible with easy control (but does get repetitive), and the sound effects are great. The environment in the levels using the Hulk's persona are extremely destructable and can be used to say smash a squad of soldiers with a car or rip a pipe off the wall and beat a monster to death. Levels using Banner are based more on stealth and thought, provides a great change of pace during game play (but very, very frustrating). Cut-scene movies are great and very entertaining. However, the ending does not flow well with the game's story and was a real let down. I recommend renting before buying on this one.
