 I'll admit that Vice City has more depth and originality, but personally I would rather play as a cop than sell drugs, steal cars, and kill hookers. However, if your a thug at heart, this game allows the player to be a dirty cop.  You won't get the unlimted access to drug running speed boats and helicopters as in VC, but True Crime does bring to the table a reasonable variety of vehicles which you might be required to "comandeer" in order to protect the citizens of L.A. from themselves. And don't forget this game has a customizable soundtrack, to many publishers are ignoring this feature for the X-box. True Crime delivers a great gameplay execution with a decent story mode. There is no denying that this is a GTA clone, however it does provide an excellent gaming experience.
