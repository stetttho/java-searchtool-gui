 I'm very impressed with the improvements added that have made this title better. First is the ability to combat roll in the prone position. Second and most important is the improved enemy A.I. and overall apperance of graphics(with the exception of the new Jones). The combat system feels more solid in execution, however bodies still vanish and you still have to locate weapon caches for ammo. This sequel is based more on urban combat(and we're talking some big, intense maps here) than on the open desert fighting of the first game. The X-box version still has the great multi-player cooperative format, which is the best feature of the game.
