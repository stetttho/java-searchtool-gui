 This is a modern game for fans of the old Centipede and Zaxxon arcade shooters. Characters can only move left or right across the bottom of the screen shooting and throwing grenades at many types of aliens and zombies. At the end of each level you fight a giant boss, like in Contra. The graphics are great but the voice acting and storyline sucks. If you liked the old-school arcade shooters, you'll find this to be fun!
