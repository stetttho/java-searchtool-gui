 Folk's sometimes you just have to leave your past in the past. Seems this is a new version of the dessert kid, revived for the current generation. That's right the movie was made for our kids, it's ok to let your childhood rest peacefully. Look I'm personally still upset that Duke's no longer head hancho at GI Joe. With that said lets just give the new kid a chance. I've got three preschoolers and one in big K, all four of them really like this movie. It has a decent story and nice, well written music and songs. I could see this becoming yet one more cartoon I'm forced to watch regularly. My kids love it and that's who it's made for so I'm giving it five stars (even though I want to put my boot in the cat's furry little butt, every time she opens her mouth).
