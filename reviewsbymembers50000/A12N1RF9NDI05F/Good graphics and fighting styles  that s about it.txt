 I really hate to say this, but the truth is the game is pretty boring. The game's fighting mechanics for each individual character have very reponsive controls in an easy format. The graphics are very good, story line is entertaining but not great, and you get to fight against several of the FF's better known enemies. Unfortunately the first group of levels are extremely brief. The latter levels have a strong sense of "been there, done that", with many common enemies having the basic style of attack with just different character skins. There is a small element of puzzle solving, but the meat of the game is button-mashing combat. Characters can progess their skills through acquiring score and purchasing moves. There is co-op two player only support (why no 4-player?), and some pretty good interviews and other stuff to unlock. Very good concept, but overall repeditive and stale gameplay. Rent or buy used, you'll most likely regret buying new.
