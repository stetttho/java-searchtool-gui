 If this game would have been an N64 title it would have been great, but on the Game Cube it lacks depth. Sum of All Fears is the little brother of Ghost Recon but plays more like a Rainbow Six clone. My major complaint is the lackluster graphics. The environments are some what detailed put they and the characters seem not quite finished. Enemy AI is moderately challenging, however your team is clumsy and a burden. You command a three man team (which you cannot switch between unless someone dies), that is given a specific entry route to follow generated by the game (you don't get to choose your own waypoints). While you are executing your tasks, other assault teams (friendly AI, 3man teams) conduct simultaneous assaults which generally provide effective supporting fire. In this game your not the boss like in Rainbow Six, instead your a middle manager taking orders from Jack Ryan and John Clark. I kinda like this bold move, it makes you feel like your part of a large assault on most levels. OK, weapon assortment is very good, BUT the auto-aiming can get easily distracted by multiply enemies (solution : grenade, spray and pray). Enemy weapons fire is realistic, you start getting effective fire and you're going down. Sound is decent, but transition screen is slow and frustrating. I gave it 4 stars because even with it's problems, the game is a fun, challenging SWAT style FPS. They should have put more time into this, but it's worth the bargain price if you are a Rainbow Six fan.
