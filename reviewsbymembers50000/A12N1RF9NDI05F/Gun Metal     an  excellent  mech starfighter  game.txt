 This is a great game! I just bought a copy of this highly overlooked title and was extremely impressed. Overall I would rate this 4 out of 5 for complete lack of developing storyline and few upgrades. This is a straight mission brief then shoot'em up, but done very well. The premise of the game is that you have a giant robot that transforms into a sleek fighter craft, both handle very well and have an excellent amount of firepower. Gameplay takes a few times on the first level to master both aspects of your mech, but is not to difficult to learn. Graphics are very good and the environment is destructible. Sound is also pretty good and allows for a customized soundtrack (selections from Star Wars and HALO fit in really well). This is a very fun mech game in the Third Person Shooter format, that plays a lot like an arcade game. It's basically Armored Core + Transformers + Rogue Squadron!!!
