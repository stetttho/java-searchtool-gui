 The line up here should have just called themselves DRAMA. As Yes, this was a failure, the one listenable track being essentially a Jon Anderson knock off. The songs don't hold up well, and really apart from tracks 13 thru 16, which show you where Anderson might have taken the band, there is little point in this CD. Squire and Howe are not strong enough on their own to carry YES forward. It was good that Wakeman was out and Downes and Horn do their best, but they were essentially standing in. That role suited neither of them. Downes went on to ASIA, Horn went to the control room.  Back then, it was generally assumed YES was dead in the water. Thankfully, Squire and White found Rabin and Kaye. Out of the ashes of DRAMA came 90125.
