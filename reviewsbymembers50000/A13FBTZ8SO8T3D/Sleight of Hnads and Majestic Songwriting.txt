 Steve Kingsley is one of the finest English songwriters post Richard Thompson, with a more sublime sense of melody and a passionate delivery that gets you involved in a big way with the dramas of his stories. And what dramas they are! Whether they are covering Traditional material or their own ( and their own fits so seamlessly with the great English, Scots and Irish traditions that you won't be able to distinguish), these two men and their accomplices play as though their lives depend on it. Their current release COLD FRONTIER (come on Amazon, get with it and get their catalogue on line!!!!) will absolutely be at the top of evryone's Best of 2003 list.  This double disc is a best of, and it culls material from a lot of their major Brit CDs. If you have trouble finding their stuff in the States, search out Folk Roots magazine website. In any case, if you are unfamiliar with this duo, begin with this set. Every song is amazing. In fact, every song they have ever done is amazing, and this double disc will give you a phenomenal overview and a great introduction. I urge you to purchase this! Songwriting and singing, the musicianship (hence their name) and the arrangements are spot on all the way through. OK, stop reading, go press the button to order.
