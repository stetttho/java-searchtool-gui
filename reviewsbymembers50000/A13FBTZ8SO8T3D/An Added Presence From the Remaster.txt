 Still in a period of transition, Cockburn's music and lyrics were moving from the contemplative to an engaged Christianity. "How I Spent My Fall Vacation" foretells the observational analyses of US politics that would reach an extraordinarily angered pitch with STEALING FIRE. Here, though, Cockburn is just beginning to assess the political fallout from the overeaching by developed nations upon the world's poor.  Musically, Bruce continues on the trajectory of incorporating more world influences beyond European, Celtic, that was certainly present on DANCING. While this is not quite as strong as DANCING, it is nonetheless full of terrific songs: the aforementioned "How...", "Tokyo", "Fascist Architecture." Bruce had also by this time assembled a crack band: Hugh Marsh on violin, Dennis Pendrith on bass, Bob Di Salle (who, with Pendrith, came from Murray McLaughlin's remarkable Golden Tractors band)on drums, Kathryn Moses on vocals and reeds, Jon Goldsmith on keyboards. Live, they were formidable! They gave Bruce that push to examine new textures and to take more chances with his own guitarcraft. There is a lot of greta and subtle displays on this disc. The bonus track is a great out-take from the trio tour with Ferguson Jemeson Marsh on Chapman Stick, and Michael Sloski from the Ontario Place concert that was the source material for his live CD of 1989. Perhaps, Rounder will convince True North, Bernie Finkelstein and Cockburn to release a DVD of that show. It was incredible - perhaps the best show I've ever seen in Toronto. In any case, another triumph for the remastering team!
