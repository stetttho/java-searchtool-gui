 This chick is really HOT, but she kinda stinks as a classical fiddle player. Definitely not in the league with the Ahn Trio or Sarah Chang, or Anne Sofie Mutter, babes all but with the chops to match. Kinda like Liberace for heteros, Vanessa Mae has a charming tone that works just great in Vegas, but leaves a cloying film on your teeth if you try to digest any of this thoughtfully. There is a double live set with Celine Dion or Diana Krall somewhere in her future.
