 If I had just heard any of these cuts on the radio without an identification, I'm sure I would not have guessed this was RLJ. This is a really impressive turn in her writing that is full of wonderful surprises, and a sophisticated coolness that seems continents away from LA. All of the songs hang together incredibly, and what you may have thought as RLJ trademarks are completely absent. It is as though she threw away the script and started absolutely freshly. Consequently, I am as impressed by this CD as I was by the first or FLYING COWBOYS, but for very independent reasons. To be honest, I can't think of an artists who has so sublimely represented themselves. EVENING OF MY BEST DAY might just be the literal truth here. The opening track is as Miles/Coltrane infused as anything I have ever heard since, well, Miles and Coltrane. The political rant "Tell Somebody" cuts through the polemics and lays it out as clearly as you can what an insult to human dignity John Ashcroft is. "A Face In The Crowd" and "Little mysteries" are among the best songs she has ever written. The orchestration of the writing is very different than her past efforts. As I mentioned, there is an identifying sound to RLJ, and that simply was set totally aside. As such, this resounds like a New York driven CD instead of something bred in the burnout, Charles Bukowski atmosphere of LA that seemed always to be hinted at in Jones and Waits work. It is so completely fresh that you just have to wonder at her incredible courage as well as craft. This is a great Cd, and an even greater RLJ CD.
