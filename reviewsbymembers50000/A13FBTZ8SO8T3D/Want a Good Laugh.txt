 Check out the hair style. Jeez, it's hard to imagine that this guy was considered a fashion plate. This is also before he got his teeth fixed properly. They're better than they were in ZIGGY or the DICK CAVETT spots, but he still has a nasty set of choppers. The songs are terrific. The band is silly. The video shoot is dated - this is why MTV died. It's worse than 80's porno and has production values that will make you cringe. I'd usually be the one telling you that Canadians wouldn't turn something like this out, but alas, it was shot in Vancouver. I've checked the crowd scenes for PK but he's fortunatley nowhere to be seen. Apropos of nothing, scenes are intercut with promotional posters announcing the next song, or in some cases, backstage footage of Bowie with a chameleon...... Oh wait! I get it! I recall going to this and the Glass Spiders Tour and feeling happy that Bowie was on the way to cleaning himself up. They were good shows in their day and in spite of the naff camera work - some of it is SOOOO BAD that it's like a high school fim club someplace like Malvern - the video is worth having. He brought a fun spirit to the proceedings and is joyfully engaged with his audience. So, have a good laugh and enjoy the music. And thank God for Soupy Sales' sons and Gail Anne Dorsey!
