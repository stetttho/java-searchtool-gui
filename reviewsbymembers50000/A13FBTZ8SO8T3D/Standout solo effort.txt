 Of all of his releases, save his collaborations with Robert Fripp and his duo CD with John Cale, this is the most listenable and the most engaging of the lot. What's true about all of these 70's recordings is that you have before you the blueprints for the aesthetics that Brian Eno would bring to the service of Bowie, Talking Heads, U2, and a host of others. Here are the building blocks that would infuse the sensibilities of Daniel Lanois, Peter Gabriel, both the new wave movement and the new age movement. What would become the revolution in recording evidenced by the Berlin-trio from Bowie is in its nascent stages here. Eno is nowhere near the songwriter of Bowie, Byrne and Bono, but his craft in the studio, and the edginess inspired by Fripp, took what would have been the end of any number of careers and found them new life. This particular Cd has the best of his writing. Fripp plays as though he were co-writer, and Phil Collins still had something to prove as a drummer. Cale reappears as do a number of other colleagues, but essentially, this will come off as a Fripp & Eno project, with words and a dancebeat to it. Keep in mind, HEROES, FEAR OF MUSIC, LOW, LODGER were next up. GREEN WORLD lets you in on the revolution Eno was about to produce.
