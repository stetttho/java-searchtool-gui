 A good effort here. Too much is made of Brian Eno helping out on the first three tracks. He should have been employed for the whole album. Anyway, stripped of Ray Phiri and without a third world's rhythm to appropriate, Simon returns to his form, which is serviceable enough. These are good pop tunes. Neil Diamond writes good pop tunes as well. Wonder what Art's doing?
