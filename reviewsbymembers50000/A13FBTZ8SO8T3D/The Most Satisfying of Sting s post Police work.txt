 It's a big job being Gordon Sumner. I'm not sure I have the hat size for it, but coming off a meteoric rise to fame with the Police, Sting had something to prove and was determined to show he was the creative genius in that band. Outdoing Stewart Copeland's move into avant-rock and world music, Der Stingle opted for a jazz-rck approach and put together a group of young lions who wanted to free themselves from the straight jacket of Wynton Marsalis. So, with Branford Marsalis and Kenny Kirkland holding down the band, this tour rightly became the stuff of legend. The Police in concert were amphetamine fueled thrash ska that bore precious little resemblance to the studio band. Cleansing himself, Sting got back in the groove, re-discovered what an amazing bassist he was in his own write and worked his band through an incredible set list. I dare say that after the Soul Cages or the Dreaming Sea, Sting was never quite this good. Certainly after the death of his parents, his CDs were a mish-mosh of genius, and ideas that went terribly wrong in mid-air. He had more focus earlier on. His head hadn't outgrown his eyes. In any case, both Marsalis and the late Kirkland are so incredible throughout this disc, it almost passes for one of their own CDs with Sting as vocalist. I'd highly recommend this disc for two very sound musical reasons: 1. It's just incredibly hot and passionate musicking 2. It will p*ss off Wynton to the point where he can't see straight.
