 Nguyen Le is one of the most original and listenable guitarists in music today. A deep passion for jazz is here coupled with a sublime reverence for the folk songs of his home country, and it is one of the CDs I listen to most in my collection. The songs are simply great songs and his arrangements carry an Indochine mystique to them that have you searching the web for the next flight to Saigon, Hue or Hanoi.  Based in Paris with his friend Huong Thanh, who sings like an angel, and is often Nguyen Le's colleague, Nguyen Le creates soundscapes richly imaginative and passionately evocative of the spirit of his country. These are romantic songs at heart, and there seems little as captivating as listening to the seductive voice of Huong Thanh present her entreaties to the listener. This is a great, great CD, as sensual as KIND OF BLUE, as passionate as anything in Pat Metheny's catalogue. The session musicians assembled here are the cream of the current French jazz scene, including Michel Benita and Francois Verly. Trilok Gurtu adds his remarkable percussion, and fellow Viet Namese musicians, Thai An and Hao Nhien round out the textures and flavours that enrapture the listener. One of the great tributes that you can pay someone who takes explorative and creative directions with traditional material is if this creative pulse sends the listener to inquire more about the source material. This CD did just that for me. It is a brilliant testament in a stellar body of work. The mysteries unveiled in these rapturous songs wil intoxicate your spirit.
