 It's hard to convey to someone what a piece of music means to you, whether you are the writer, performer or audient. Something other always escapes. It is why we turn to music when confronting the ineffable. I have turned to this disc often. Composed by Fripp in dedication to the passing of his mother, it is a deeply spiritual and profoundly emotional piece. When my wife's parents passed, this CD was a source of great comfort to her. As I have sought to pick up the tral where my own spirituality died off, I seem to sense its whereabouts in my soul as I listen to this.  The music herein will stay with you forever. Of all the brilliant pieces of music for which Robert Fripp has been responsible, this is the one for which we owe him deep and soulful gratitude. It is absolutely a blessing of tears...
