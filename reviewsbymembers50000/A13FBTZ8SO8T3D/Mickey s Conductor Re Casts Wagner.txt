 This box set is a very definitive tour de force of Wagner's incredible music delivered with imagination and prowess by that most iconoclastic conductor and his Philadelphians. It might justly be argued that these are the recordings that established the Philadelphia Sound. Stokowski was always his own man. True  enough of any conductor, but in as much as my father used to deliver sandwiches to him during rehearsals across and down Syndenham Street, his personality and his predilections were well known, and the stuff of legends. For all that, he COMMANDED this orchestra. They were HIS, and they knew it. Fitting then that he should re-work Wagner according to Stokowski.  The music speaks for itself. It is spectacular! Tremendous effort by Ward Marston to bring these old &8's and whatever source tapes he could acquire to such wonderful sonics should be acknowledged as well. Ward is a master at how things should sound, and he is as much the star of these recordings as Stokowski and the PhO. Clarity and tempi must have driven him crazy, and yet, for all that, he has produced a remastered work of genius. The sound of these recordings is simply breathtaking. So, if you have an avocation for Wagner, Leopold, the old Philly O, or wonderful recordings, this is an absolute must. Ward's been nominated for Grammies for his technical work. He should have won one for this. Anytime you see Ward Marston's name, you can be assured of excellence. This set is absolutely worth the price.
