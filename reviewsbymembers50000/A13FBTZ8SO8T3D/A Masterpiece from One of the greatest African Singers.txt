 As much as I enjoy African music, I was totally unprepared for how remarkable this CD is. From the opening moments, the music sweeps you away. Cesaria Evora comes in to intone her magic and you are thereafter transported to a spiritual place of sublime beauty. Keita is regarded as one of the greatest singers ever in all of African music. With "Moffou" he has created his masterpiece. You will find yourself returning again and again to the sinewy turns of rhythm, the percolating bass and guitar lines, the lilt of the African strings and the passionate and delicate beat of the percussion. There is so much here that is wonderful! Keita's voice aches with entreaty, resonates with joy, and dances in celebration throughout the album. The photography and the graphics are beautiful. The musicians are first rate and seemed to have understood the wealth of this material and so bring its treasures to lustrous effect in their playing. It is sympathetically produced. This is not a big production glossy studio effort. It is organic, yet professional. Sublime. All in all, a diamond to turn over and over in your soul.
