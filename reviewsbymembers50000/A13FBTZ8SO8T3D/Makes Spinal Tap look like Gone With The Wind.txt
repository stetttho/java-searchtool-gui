 I am a huge fan of McCartney, but this is just too awful for words. As concerned a she is about re-configuring his place in the Beatles history, not exactly without merit, the more you learn about Lennon, you can't help but wonder why he wouldn't destroy the masters of this. Please, Mac, bury this and give us the complete Rooftop Concert now that the tapes have been found, which by the way, is the premise of this stinker.
