 What is arguably the very best CD of the 80's, and certainly of a career, is now out in an absolutely stirring remastering CD and DVD side. Arguments about the format notwithstanding, this is an essential disc to re-purchase. It sounds F*C%ING UNBELIEVABLE. The presence and definition on the CD side is stunning. The 5.1 separation on the DVD side will jar you. Along with REMAIN IN LIGHT, This disc remains light years ahead of anything that has come in its wake. What was lost in the vinyl, and not all that great on the first set of CDs now makes sense. What you hear going on in the different levels will thrill you, get you dancing and have you grinning from ear to ear. The DVD side has some nice video and the packaging is up to TH trend setting standards. I still have the Robert Rauschenberg vinyl of this, and will likely never play it, but this one from an audio perspective is every bit the treasure of the RR.
