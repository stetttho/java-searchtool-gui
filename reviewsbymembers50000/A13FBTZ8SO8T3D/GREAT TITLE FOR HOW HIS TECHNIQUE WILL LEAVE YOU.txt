 Anyone who has paid the least bit of attention to Cockburn knows that he is a formidable guitarist. A graduate of Berklee along with Pat Metheny, and clearly influenced by the immortal Mississippi John Hurt, Cockburn has sprinkled his CDs with instrumental tracks of wonder through out his career. Some of the very best of those are collected here along with three newer efforts that will leave you stunned and smiling. You'd handily sell your soul to any divination to play half this well. There really is no other message to this. This is just fantatstic guiatr playing, soulful, joyful, intricate, simple. Like Teilhard de Chardin, Cockburn seeks to hold both ends of the string. He does so with a sense of wonder. Prepare your sensibilities to become spellbound!
