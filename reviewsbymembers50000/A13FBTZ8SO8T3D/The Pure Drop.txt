 I'll never understand why Hothouse Flowers never found a bigger audience in North America. They had more interesting tunes, they were more fun than U2, but less anthemic. Lord knows the Yanks like anthems, something they can march into foreign countries with.  Anyway, time withered away and Liam O Maonlai's band withered with it. There is the occasional release from Dublin, but their heyday has passed. I suppose that has given Liam pause to consider his heritage. He does here with so fine a recording, raw, primal and pure that he serves to honour and advance the sean nos tradition, particularly as it was practiced fado fado o shin i gConnemara. This is positively brilliant singing, feadog stain playing and bodhran syncopation as you'll ever hear on any CD at any point in the great canon of Irish traditional music. The dedication here is to Sean O Riada, and certainly O Riada would be flattered by so spiritual a reading.  There are many standout tracks, and it's hard to single out my favourite, but even O Maonlai's compositions ring with an authenticity that is infused with his roots. Accompaniement is minimal, most often just O Maonlai himself on feadog stain and bodhran, or the occasional bass pedals and swell of a church organ. It is as wild as the landscape below Roundstone, as desperate and as spiritual as anything you'll ever hear from a remote corner of an island that, prior to the Celtic Tiger, was the last harbinger of a people who were close to the earth. How much of that remains, I couldn't possibly say. This disc, though, will remind you of what was once a very living culture.
