 On what is likely the disc that Wynton Marsalis will have to realize he will never be up to, the 5.1 channel sound has accomplished the impossible of making a perfect recording sound ever more perfect, more intimate, more of the moment. This is the jazz CD you are not allowed to die before listening to. So much has been written that it's positively stupid for me to extol its virtues any further. Instead, let me just encourage you to pick up this edition, set it into your very best 5.1 sound system, close your eyes. This music is right there all around you and for a disc that always sounded so incredibly essential, that has just taken on an entirely new meaning. I like this far more than the SACD version, and I hope Columbia and the Davis estate will consider giving this treatment to his entire ouevre. That should finally send Wynton and his Coca-cola glissandos off the Chrysler building for ever. This is the disc that all of us point to when Troupe, Wynnie and the entire retro-jazz clique say they don't get it: well, it was never about the notes, lads, it was about the silence between them. You'll hear that as never before on this version.
