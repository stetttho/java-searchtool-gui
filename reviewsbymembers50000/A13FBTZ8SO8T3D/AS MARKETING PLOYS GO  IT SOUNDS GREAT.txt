 Bear in mind, trhere is no argument about the selection of material here. If you're a fan, this collection plays to all of their strengths and wisely avoids any material from AFTER THE STORM and that infamous weenie-roast, LIVE IT UP. Unfortunately, it also avoids AMERICAN BEAUTY, which had a number of great Young-Crosby moments throughout. Even Stills rose to the occasion on that one. Still, if you were going to assemble a package that would capitalize on the catalogue that all of us Woodstock-wannabe's regard as the amber moments of peace and righteous thinking, this is it. If you're not a fan, you wouldn't have bothered reading any of these reviews anyway. The strength of this release, and the eclusive reason for buying it, is how incredibly great and marvellous and clear and distinct the vocals have been remastered! It truly is an aural wonder to hear and be able to identify when Crosby, Stills or Nash chime in (or for that matter when Mike Finnegan pinch hit for a drug addled Crosby). I can not remember any of their other re-mastered releases sounding this clear and well-defined. It's a joy. Almost like sitting there in front of them. Still in all, I would think there is more money to be made in releasing some of their live shows, especially ones I caught at the Mann in Philly or in Toronto. They were astoundingly brilliant and especially in the Canadian shows singing like their visitor visas depended on it. Post addiction performances were often about redeeming their career, even if the newer material was lame. The fact that they could rise above their self-inflicted wounds was inspiring, and so perhaps they'll get around to that. Pearl Jam, the Dead, King Crimson have found gold in concert tapes, I'd hope CSN would do the same. Their shows were worth it. Even though you may have all of the songs on this set, I'd tell you this is definitely worth it. You'll be stunned by the vocals, and that was always their strong point.
