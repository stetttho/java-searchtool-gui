 It seems the grim reaper has been busy inspiring songwriters of late. George Harrison, Johnny Cash, Warren Zevon all turned in truly incredible releases, some with a sense of humour, all with a view towards the human frailty of our grasp on life. To that mix nearly came Gordon Lightfoot whose burst vessels in his hometown nearly laid him to rest. Thank God they did not. He remains the genuine article,, and these songs telegraph an ominous sense he must have had about his precarious health over the past few years. He has not looked well, but has worked hard on keeping himself fit and living a healthy life, and that effort alone is credited with keeping him here among us. Before his emergency battle, Gordon had a studio and live CDs spinning in the planning stages. He had recorded a bunch of songs just himself. They are, each of them, brilliant. There is also a few reels of tape from his legendary Massey Hall shows every year, and while recuperating, he and his trsudty sidemen set about completing the demos, albeit while he remained in hospital, and selecting 2 gems from the most recent concerts.  The songs are wonderfully crafted and show what an amazing band he has. The arrangements all sound live, which is how he records them, and there is a presence about the songs that elevate them to sheer beauty and power. If you are a fan, you will be extraordinarily moved. This is spectacular. As to the live numbers, hopefully, there is a box set in the works, or another DVD or two. He is so absolutely ON for "Shellfish" and "No Hotel," that you will wish you had been there. Thank God Gordon is still with us. Few craft a song as exquisitely as he does. No one captures Canada as he does. Along with SIT DOWN YOUNG STRANGER, OLD DAN'S RECORDS, DON QUIXOTE, SUMMERSIDE OF LIFE, SHADOWS, SUNDAY CONCERT, SUNDOWN, this as truly brilliant a Lightfoot CD as you'll ever come across.
