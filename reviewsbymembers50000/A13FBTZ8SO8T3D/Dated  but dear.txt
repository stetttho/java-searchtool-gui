 Oscar Wilde on Mellotron, this. Long before there was the Blue Nile, OMD virtually, in every sense of the word, created late twentieth century romanticism. This music came about as rock and pop were emrging from punk and disco, and seemed to find its soul in Cole Porter and its expression via The Moody Blues. The melodies were simple, the lyrics painfully poignant, and the wash of sustain and release ecstatic. At times they could be chillingly post-cold war, at others as distanced and alienated as Berlin era Bowie. The juxtaposition of Andrew McCluskeys sometimes droning and off-key voice only heightened the alienation. This outfit had a huge subliminal effect across pop and rock and in that time period, they stood for something other. They were the commercial voice of avant garde artists like Tangerine Dream, and in no uncertain terms, they are the progenitors of techno and ambient music. And this was their crowning acheivement. It is about to be released domestically in mid May, 2003, so you might want to hold up on your purchase. But it is absolutely worth it. The additional material includes pieces that came out as B sides and singles, and they are very strong selections. My guess is that in the English gay club scene, OMD was a singles band.   The world would change for them all too quickly. They were part of that great period post punk and disco when independent radio sought out them, Cocteau Twins, Kate Bush, and U2 (yeah, once they were very dancehall), that undercurrent just below the Peter Gabriel level. Too rapidly, it all got corporate and kitschy with Prince and Madonna and that whole sick US dilettante circuit. There was a gossamer quality to this, but unlike most products of their time, this has held up marvellously.
