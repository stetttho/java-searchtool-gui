 This girl has the juice in spades. Genetically at an advantage to every other musician alive, Eliza Carthy rests not on her laurels but pushes what Brit Trad can be to altogether new horizons. Give her parents credit for encouraging her to be her own woman, because what she accomplishes honours and advances a tradition that had been in remission since the best days of Dave Swarbrick.  This is just another fine Cd in a long line of releases that began with her partnership with Nancy Kerr and has flourished inc combination with her parents and through a set of solo releases. With the Rat group of bandmates, she has what Young found in Crazy Horse, or Hiatt recently with the North Mississippi All Stars: ie, a band that knew where her groove was and could take it places. They chemistry hear is even better than the stint with the Kings of Callicut, and it's clear on every track that they are a collection of equals endorsing each other's strengths.  Carthy is SO good, you almost don't notice it. Damn! How many artists can you say that about? While the rest of the world samples and writes by committee, EC looks to a tradition and finds room to soar to new heights. Her voice is more resonant of her father, but she certainly has her Mom's swagger and that gait is meant to move. Move you she does. I'd compare her to Sandy Denny but that's unfair to both women. Sandy was a different singer whose profound influence is still felt. EC isn't in the same place, and isn't concerned about that either. She has a path to blaze on her own, and hopefully we'll see that cultivate over a very long life. Anyway, you get the idea: Eliza Carthy is already one of the great ones. This CD settles that point and looks forward to the future.
