 Sure, this will offend the faithful, but in reality, Levin is much stronger in a supporting roll than as a leader, be it head writer or lead singer - these are not and have never been his strongest points. Back when lennon asked him not to play like McCartney, it must have struck Levin as funny. One can only imagine the number of snappy ripostes that could have been directed at the world's luckiest rhythm guitarist. All these years later, Levin is his own man and in many combinations is the stellar player. He is here as well. You can not help but be awed by his chops. He digs deeper than anyone, save possibly Foley McCready, and God only knows where he is these days. It's just that Levin is not a great lyricist, nor a great vocalist. He has something to say, that in itself is worth hearing, but he ain't Belew. or McCartney. I like this CD, but it is a bit like liking Adrian Belew's CDs: they are good, worth a listen, but how much stays with you, I don't know. This will not supplant the work Levin has done with Bruford at any point in any band, YES, KC, BLUE, nor with Gabriel. In some ways, it gives you an angle on what he brings to Crim, but that's a function of the dialectic between the whole and the sum of the parts. It adds up here, just.
