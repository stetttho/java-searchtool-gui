 Given the positioning of both Wagner's DAS RHEINGOLD  and Mozart's Piano Concerto throughout the score, to release a soundtrack without them is an insult, especially given the way that the cinematography is timed exquisitely with those two pieces as well as Horner's music.  In point of fact, the film is a three hour Eternity commercial, but Wagner, Lewis, makes it bearable. Don't buy this disc. If someone gives it to you, use it as a coaster. Go invest in any good rendition of Wagner overtures and recall the beautiful lighting and unspoiled scenery, Kilcher's form and face. But skip this.
