 Given that much of his music is thematically focused on those places in the human psyche where we are most fragile, it is a relief that his family comes off as so, well, much like a normal family. He has surely paid a price for it, but it is actually very touching to see the daughters from his first marriage so adoringly supporting their father. Every father's dream... They all negotiate the terrain of a younger second wife and new siblings with grace and genuine warmth, and Gabriel is such a Wally Cleaver at times, that it strikes you as intimately funny. The film is an intimate document, and maybe everyone was on best behaviour, but for all the odd bits in his songs, he and his brood are downright Englishy and charming. Given the sad disruption detailed in US of his first marriage, along with histrionics from Sinead O Connor and a joust or two with Rosanna Arquette, it's a miracle his girls would have anything to do with him, let alone go on tour. And while neither are quite the performer Paula Cole was, their presence alongside their Dad surely is a source of strength and great comfort for him. Maybe after all these dance hall episodes of r.d. laing's existential psychoanalysis, Gabriel felt the need to share some home movies so that the men with the nets weren't waiting at every portal. It's all great to see how bloody normal they really are. Not every Brit is a variation of Richards-Jagger-Osbourne-Waters-Barrett. Yikes, imagine if we all were! Nor is everyone positively fabulous in that McCartney and Harrison sort of genuine bonhomie among their clans. How about that? they're just like us, after all. I liked this film and while it offers nothing new on the Gbariel songbook, it has its own charm and honesty, and will buy Peter a little time until he turns out his next CD. That works...
