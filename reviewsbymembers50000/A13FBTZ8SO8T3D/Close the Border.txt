 Don't get me wrong, I am passionate and quite nationalistic about my Canadian heritage, but this woman is as nearly lifeless as you can get. I need someone to sit me down and walk me through this like I'm a 2 year old, cause I just don't hear what all the fuss is about. Laconic to the point of being audio Sominex, I don't know how the band stayed awake for the whole concert. There's no point in referencing the audience reaction. The French will clap for anything. I've watched the DVD on really expensive Bang and Olufsen plasma gear and I still don't find my pulse doing anything other than slowing down. This is the soundtrack for plays by Samuel Beckett, and makes one just want to snap one's fingers and tap one's toes to John Cage's "Three Minutes of Silence." Much hoopla was made about her rendition of "Look of Love" and "A Case of You", PUUHHHLLEASSE! Dusty Springfield she aint, and Joni Mitchell should sue. No sensuality and no tragedy stains her delivery.  If necessary, close the border. That's enough of lifelessness posing as music. Diana Krall makes Cowboy Junkies sound like a hyper-kinetic punk band. At one point I thought the worst record I ever heard was Philip Glass and Ravi Shankar (who thought that up?), but I got a new nightmare: Diana Krall and Crazy Horse.....
