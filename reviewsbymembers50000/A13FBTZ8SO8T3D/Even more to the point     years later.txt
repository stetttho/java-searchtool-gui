 This is the CD that got Bruce's VISA lifted by the Reagan Administration. His endorsement of Nicaragua's Sandanista Movement of itself is one of the most impassioned calls to arms in all of music. Pity Ortega couldn't deliver on the promise. That failure does not invalidate the premises put forth here. And the premises are ever more to the point of the deadly morass perpetrated by the thrust and parry of Islamic terrorism and the last Imperial power (assuming the People's Repression in China never gets its rice together). Remove the seductive Latin underpinings to the songs here, and the struggle of the third world confronting the champion of the WTO remains the central dialectic of this part of the Twenty-First Century. Bruce diseects that dialectic, puts a human face on what the politics of avarice mean. The music, though, is extraordinary: those Latin underpinings give this disc a samba and a sway that are truly intoxicating. The people he writes about seem to look up at you in your imagination's eye. His anger at the murderous helicopter gunships boils in your blood. You can, after all this time, taste the hatred for Reagan-Thatcher in your mouth, you'll find yourself wishing the IRA had been just a wee bit luckier in Birmingham, this is engaged Christianity on the verge of losing its compassion. To Cockburn's credit, he pulls back from this ledge. This CD and DANCING are his two best, by virtue of the power of the music and the messages. The remastering job is absolutely STERLING! The additional tracks are as strong as everything else on this remarkable disc. They really add to the power of the CD. No wonder he is Canada's greatest living songwriter.
