 Mind you, I like Gabriel's music and have found in many instances, like the concert supporting US, that he taps a major root in the psyche of anyone sorting out exactly the pickle they are in. So, when you get a collection like this, you can't help but donning the Freudian beard and glasses and wondering where the electrodes were placed on that monkey. Sure, most of it is entertainment, but with Gabriel, there is also that element of lifting the curtain so that you see behind the Wizard of Id's mask. The music herein has been effectively remastered and I suspect remixed, as I noticed keyboards and percussion treatments on several songs that I'm sure I never heard before. Gabriel's most touching video is the one for FATHER AND SON, his most ridiculous BLOOD OF EDEN, perhaps the funniest five minutes of film you'll ever watch, and all credit goes to Sinead. The most embarrassing is the video with Kate Bush, not that I wouldn't mind trading places, but, it is a bit overwrought, like the song itself. You gotta give Gabriel credit for the very high standards he maintained throughout his video career. Unlike Bowie, whose SOUND AND VISION videos are often really stupid, Gabriel was always looking to draw the viewer in first and then create a psychological disturbance. He's damned good at it. My mother always thought his music was perfect for Halloween, not in an Alice Cooper way, but as part of that Anglo-Celtic tradition that reveres the plight of souls set adrift from their mooring in this world. Before we leave our bodies, Gabriel often sings about what ropes are coming undone. The videos enhance that. Still in all, both as a video and as a tune, BARRY WILLIAMS should have been left on the cutting floor. 'Twas a tune that did not singing and a film that needed no shooting. The rest has enough material to keep a symposium of shrinks busy for years. Enjoy.
