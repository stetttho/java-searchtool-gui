 Extremely well written, this mystery has Morse and Lewis on the trail of a murderer when all the evidence points to death by natural causes. In the course of the story Morse must deal with all sorts of wealthy American tourists, and one wonders whether this film had any impact on the screenwriters of GOSFORD PARK. Whether it did or not, and whether the actors are really Yanks or not, the cultural clashes are more overtly funny than this series usually gets, Morse is very nearly Basil Fawlty in several scenes. By this time in the series, Whatley and Thaw were really hitting their stride and their natural ease with each other made these films entirely believeable. Dexter set out to write these stories because he thought he could do a better job than what he had read in the genre, and he did just that. Morse and Lewis are every bit the match for Holmes and Watson. Anyway, this is a great story, brilliantly written for the screen, and one in which Morse's caustic humour is let run rampant over each and every person with whom he collides. Oh yeah, a jewel is stolen and a woman is dead. Who done it..... that would be telling.
