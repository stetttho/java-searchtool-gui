 Trevor Rabin did a remarkable thing with Yes in 90125. He played an important part in the very fine BIG GENERATOR. But this was a real mistake. Yes was clearly out of gas by this point, and went through the motions behind Rabin's lead. Steve Howe was never positive about Rabin's contributions, and this sealed it as far as Howe was concerned. He is right. Apart from the closing track, it is an OK CD by a hired gun. Production values are fine, but this should have been billed as a Trevor Rabin disc. The franchise value was diluted by this effort. It would signal a tail spin for YES that they would not pull out of until MAGNIFICATION. Not as bad as DRAMA, but certainly not up to par.
