 This is a good CD, very much in line with what Coldplay does and they'll no doubt make a bundle on it. It doesn't push any boundaries or advance the band in the way RUSH did compared to PARACHUTES, and maybe it would be too much to expect another huge leap forward at this point. The band has to deal with Gwyneth now and Apple, and that may prove to be its Ono-ization. Hope not, but family tends to distract you. Whatever. Given that they could continue at all is something of a miracle. All the classical CP elements are in service, and most of it fits just where you'd expect. Sometimes that's a noble thing in itself. It is the acoustic bonus track that will grab you, though, as it seems to point to where they'll go next, assuming there isn't another live CD/DVD, or that one of the other lads doesn't hook up with an ubermodel/actress. Remember when rock bands faced crises because the drummer had a brain tumour?
