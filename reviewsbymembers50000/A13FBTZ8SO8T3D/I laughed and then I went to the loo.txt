 and then I read this book. The third tallest Python, and the ambiguously charming songwriter, has delivered his blog into book form in order to squeeze every penny out of the punters who Idle-ize him. And it's worth it. Now that he has hit the big time with Spamalot, perhaps something really seedy and scandolous will come out that will shock Cleese, Palin and Jones back into action. And anything that deals with his especially endearing relationship with George Harrison is worth the price. Get this and tix to Broadway and laugh a lot.
