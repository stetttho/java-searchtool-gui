 KC returns with a remarkably strong reworking of material and directions almost all of which were previewed on EPs over the past year or so. But it is a dramatic reworking. This quartet has set about developing and cultivating its own repertoire and in its 2 studio releases there is a very new bend in the Crimson river. Belew has broken the mold of his lone rhinoceros style and delivered sets of lyrics framed in haiku that minimalistically convey a powerful well of anxiety, release and and a leap of faith. At times, this quartet revisits the gamelan style of the 80's quartet and locks in more sublimely than even that remarkable ensemble did. Echoes of Soundscapes drift in the background, Dangerous Curves take hairpin turns, new levels of integration lurch the enterprise forward. This is a remarkable journal entry from a peripatetic King who refuses to rest on his laurels. In all respects, Belew, Mastellotto, Gunn and Fripp are creating with an intensity that is and always has been the exciting element of surprise in the soul of KC. This will do nothing to endear chics to them, but Fripp and his colleagues have long gotten used to serious men, some with facial hair and glasses, being the core of their support. Bruford once remarked that the King made dance music for epileptics. You'll have a joyous fit with this release. There are many rewards here for those who have placed their faith in the power to believe.
