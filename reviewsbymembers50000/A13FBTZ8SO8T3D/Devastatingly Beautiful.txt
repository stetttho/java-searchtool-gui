 Helene Grimaud is one of the most mystifying pianists of our time. She has a connection with the music that seems to be so intimately part of its execution that you could imagine the composers waiting for her to play these pieces. There is a spiritual as well as thematic integration at work here among the selections. Corrigliano's piece bears its Beethoven 7th stamp in its heart and soul. Very much the essence of both Corr and Ludwig comes out in Grimaud's wonderful articulation. Turning then to Beethoven himself, she delivers The Tempest as though foretelling Corigliano. This infinite stance between two mirrors will ride with you long after you slip the CD back in its case. Helene finishes with Part, and the whole program is taken to another spiritual plain altogether.  I can not think of another CD of extraordinary music that has moved me so strongly. The recording is absolutely pristine and intimate. This is Grimaud's territory and she commands this aura with a spiritual depth and vision as few others ever have. It's going to be tough to come up with a more devastatingly beautiful CD than this.
