 If you are sitting still through this CD, alert the undertakers. This a great collection of remixes that suffers only 2 boring cuts: tracks 6 & 7. They represent the only 2 tracks that Emerson or McNally wasn't supervising the re-mix guys, and the result is that plodding sameness that is so utterly annoying about techno and trance and all that stuff for greasy kids. The rest of it is great fun. The bonus DVD gives you 2 music videos and some footage from ACSC at WOMAD, well worth the admission price all by itself. If you are a fan, there is nothing new on this, but it still is brilliant craic!
