 of his remasters from the early to mid seventies, this is essentially Roxy Music without Ferry. Or at least a Manzanera and Eno project. In any case nowhere near the dynamic that infuses anything with the Fripp & Eno moniker. Most of the CD sounds like Eno is still trying to establish just what his identity is. There aren't any melodies to speak of, but the experiments are courageous, and better stuff was coming. I'd recommend this for the completist only.
