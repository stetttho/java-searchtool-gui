 Any excuse to hear Eric Andersen's amazing baritone is worth it, and in this case, this is part two of an effort to re-cast some of the songs from early 60's protest writers into a more dynamic setting, and it succeeds admirably. Pete Kennedy and Andersen shine on electric guitars and the songs have a more driving urgency to them than they did back in the day. The unsung hero throughout the proceedings remains Phil Ochs, whose dedication to dissent had none of the commercial envy of Dylan, and cost the dear man his nervous system, his sanity, his life. Positively 4th Street me arse, Zimmerman, you gotta lotta nerve. In the case of these sessions, Ochs' "White Boots" and "Changes" are positively brilliant. Much is made of Farina's "Bold Marauder," a tune about the Reagan effort to secure the governorship of California through the twin intimidations of fear and religion (hey, isn't that what the Republicans are accusing the Taliban and Osama-ites of perpetrating?). It ought to be heeded.  The CD concludes with a live track featuring Andersen, Judy Collins and Arlo Guthrie. It's so incredible to hear them give it all. it's just a perfect conclusion. And this should be the conclusion. There is no need to release a number 3. I'd rather hear Eric deliver his own material. For the time though, he has reminded those who would listen what great song is capable of.
