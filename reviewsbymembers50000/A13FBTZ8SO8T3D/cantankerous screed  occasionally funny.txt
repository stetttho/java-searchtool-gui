 Poor George. The world pisses him off and there's nothing he can do about it. Don't get me wrong, there are moments through this book that are particularly insightful and very funny, as he attacks how language insidiously breeds its political and religious agendas; however, there are other very long stretches where George is that obnoxious bore at the end of the bar. The 7 dirty words were a riot the first time thru back 30 years ago. Incantations not with standing, the repititive invocations here are just simply a droning and monotonous inveighing that when it doesn't strike you as unimaginative is then patently and moronically of no effect. I've always admired someone who can roll off a curse with aplomb. George isn't one of them. So, shell out the coins to the NY hustler if you must. Maybe one day he'll have enough to hire an editor.
