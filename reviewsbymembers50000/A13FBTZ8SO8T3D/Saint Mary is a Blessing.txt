 Not the masterpiece of "Leveland", but atruly great effort from a cosummate writer working with a crack band bringing life to terrific songs. Like his father, James has that ability to get inside real people and present their thoughts in unaffected, direct and often disturbing form. You'll find that in spades here. "Dry River" kicks off this impressive collection in fine McMurtry style, as the guitars percolate and the rhythm floods the plains of the protagonist's dismay. His is a weathered voice, lived in, full of the self awareness that comes when you stop kidding yourself. "Valley Road" sports one of the best visual images ever committed to a song: "he had a vibrato you could throw a cat through." Jayzuz! And what a great tune! The great Texas plains and the levelands of the midwest are the visual bakdrop for the stories told in this collection. The secret lakes, the clusters of woods, autumn, the dry hot roads of summer, the breezes that blow spirits and lives like so many tumbleweeds are where McMurtry sets his stories and finds his characters coming to grips with lives before them. You'll find no lack of brilliant musicianship and Remington like castings of the men and women of this part of the US. "Out here in the middle" portrays that in painstaking detail. "Lobo Town" is hysterically comical, as is "Choctaw Bingo", and goes to show you just how incisively he can skewer his own personna. The short of it is that this is well worth the investment. If you are a confirmed McMurtry fan, this is a welcome addition to his body of work. If you are new to McMurtry, this is a great place to start.
