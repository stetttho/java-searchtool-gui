 but in either case, this is one of the most satisfying and philosophical CDs of classical music you will ever listen to. Quasthof's voices pours down like silver, the accompaniement is spot on and the entire feel of the Cd is as soulful and melancholic as anything you'll ever hear. "Ich habe genug" is delivered with such compelling pathos that it comes off as less of a song about joyful abandonnement to God, and more of a resignation to all that is more powerful in the universe.  In fact, the whole Cd comes off as less of a devotional disc than an existential re-evaluation of where one stands. Words of praise are sung and yet, the spirit recedes. Perhaps it is to my middle age ears a sign of my own ambivalence in this descent of the arc of garvity's rainbow. Whatever, this comes from deep in Quasthof's soul and is thoroughly haunting. Bach was a reluctant believer, so maybe Q got him right. It's a terrific CD, especially if you would otherwise shy away from devotional types of things. This is devoted to the cause of reflection.
