 paul Schrader's version  of this prequel is certainly more Hitchcock than Friedkin, and that's likely what got it shelved. Pity, as it hangs together narratively better than Renny's does. Where it falls down is the supporting acting is nearly unwatchable, and Stellan Skaarsgard looks bored at having to do this film twice, as does the African actor who lays the guide. The studio shots are a bit hokey, the location shots at times convincing, at others nonsensical. It is obvious what the problems were. But for all that, Schrader opts for Hitchcock's aesthetic that what scares you is what you do not see. In that respect, Schrader's film builds suspense and has an internal logic that the alternative version does not. The young priest is a screeching hyseric who overacts his part. By the time the devil gets him, you are relieved. The actress who plays Rachel is convincingly Jewish, but has no chemistry at all with Skaarsgard. Nonetheless she is convincing as a doctor with a past, but you have to force yourself to care. The weaving of Catholic mythology with African works well. The natives are just this side of stereotyped. The soundtrack is nearly non-exitent, and that works against the film. Still, as I say, I found myself staying with it. There is a good story to tell in filling in the background to Lancaster Merrin. The first Exorcist film did not spend enough quality time on Merrin's character. Opting for green pea soup and blaxploitation special effects, it was a silly film that made me laugh almost all the way through. This film tries to make a case that before the devil went to Georgetown, Merrin and Lucifer were pitted enemies battling for the notion that evil is an inspired product of man's development. Just look at any Christian Republican....
