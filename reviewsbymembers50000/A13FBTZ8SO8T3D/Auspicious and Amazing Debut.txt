 Finally, a band worth its salt, and worth the media hype. The Stills are the genuine article, certainly with influences, but not imitative, and as refreshingly original in design and execution as anything I've heard in a very long while from rock. They are not the Pink Floyd imitators of RadioHead, nor the unfocused retreads of Coldplay, but a band with its own voice. Haven't heasrd that in a dog's age. Maybe not since Uncle Tupelo, and before them, The Band.  The Stills have a sublime sense of layering the textures of their songs, combining tempos and changing time signatures that hopefully will inspire the rest of the rock world to pay attention. The lyric writing is extremely smart, the messages profound and articulate. "Logic will break your heart" bursts out of the second song with such an alarming resonance that it reminded me of Ray Davies' "Arthur" way back when rock could pack a punch as well as tell a story.  If I had to point to an influence, I'd say it was Chryssie Hynde's attitude and love of the sound of guitars. Be it 12 string, 6, lead, echoing thirds, the sound of this Cd is so intoxicating! The Stills are absolutely on to something, and hopefully Montreal will continue to nurture and inspire their creative directions. About now, the worst thing for them would be to become appropriated by LA or anywhere else in the US. Who knows, they might even inspire Neil Young to return to Canada and re-connect with the muse that set him off in the first place. I have listened to this over and over and get a new take on it each time through. This is an incredible beginning. Hopefully, they have the legs to run with it for a very long time.
