 that holds this back. The songs are not Harrison's strongest overall, and yet, and yet, you know, they are really quite good if you can get past the horrible and shallow sounding synth treatments that crippled this CD as much as they did Steve Winwood's TALKING BACK TO THE NIGHT. If Winwood couldn't get it right, it should have told EVERYONE ELSE stay clear. Anyway, what we have here is not his solo highwater mark. Still, "All Those Years Ago" is a triumph. Coupled with George's take on Hoagy Carmichael's "Baltimore Oriole" and "Hong Kong Blues", the core of the lineup here is GREAT. "Baltimore Oriole" has been left off of too many Harrison compilations. I was totally unfamiliar with it until I listened to this disc, and now I believe it is as GREAT a song as any Dylan cover or Perkins tune that George essayed. "HK Blues" seems to foreshadow his tunes for SHANGHAI SURPRISE. And that leasd one to consider how important Carmichael might have been to Harrison. All 4 of The Beatles had a respect and enthusiastic appreciation for the American songbook, and in particular, the lesser known gems. Maybe it was all the ukeleles at Friar Park, but George is at home in these songs. They suit him to the ground, and manage to transcend the time in which they were written, much like George's songs do, to wit, the closer "Save the World," as ominously to the point, and perhaps more so, tday as the time in which it was written. The accoustic demo that is included underscores my point about the synths. Just George and guitar are infinitely more powerful, especially in his laments, than anything a studio could conjur. But the box set, then the cost for what was not George in full stride is not so apparent.
