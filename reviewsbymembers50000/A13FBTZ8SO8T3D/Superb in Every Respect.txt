 This is one of the truly great YES CDs, and perhaps their last true masterpiece. Every note, every measure every nuance is positively creative, compelling and inspiring. All of their strengths are on display. This album sounded warm, full, layered and intricate when it first arrived. Its initial transition to CD was similarly amazing, but this remaster is astonishing! The story is that YES had folded its tent after DRAMA. Squire and White had released a single and were contemplating their next move when they discovered Rabin. Tony Kaye re-surfaced and a quartet was born, CINEMA. It was Rabin who suggested a different singer and front man than he, and so Anderson walked back in, and YES reinvented itself. It was a heady trip from there on. The concerts had an energy and dynamic they never had before. They had managed to set themselves on a mission that would carry them through BIG GENERATOR, UNION, TALK before fizzling out again. Here, the music is just so terrific, the harmony and choir work so spot on, and the energy so undeniable that this is the benchmark for recreating yourself. Every single track, especially the a capella "Leave It" is thrilling. It is remasterings like these that justify the entire process. If you know the msuic, you'll be stunned by how good this is. If you are curious about YES, well, it doesn't get any better than this. A Superb Recording in Every Respect.
