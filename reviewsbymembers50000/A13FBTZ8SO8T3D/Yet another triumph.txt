 On paper, this shouldn't work. There comes a point where cross cultural efforts tuen into a ben and jerry's blend of flavours, none of which are distinct or genuine.  Not the case with Wu Man! I can think of no other musician who might pull together Ugandan, Ukrainian and Appalachian musicians and have the individual collaborations work so seemlessly into an integrated whole. More 4 and half stars than 4, and absolutely worth owning if you are a fan of any of the disciplines on offer here.  "Nandere" with James Makubuya is magical, positively a match kissed by God Himself, were the old codger able to carry a tune in a bucket. "Love Song" displays everything that enchants you about traditional Chinese music, and in the hands of Wu Man, it is a reverie of passion and desire and longing so sublime as to transport you to where your heart dwells most peotically. Odd metered work outs with Julian Kytasty are the stuff that works up a sweat in the likes of Andy Irvine or Nikola Parov, and the duo work here is sheer brilliance. Jolting the listener back to North Carolina with Lee Knight steels its way into the mix so effectively, you'd swear these tunes were meant to follow each other! The recording is miked perfectly and balanced to give the Cd an intimate feel of people sitting around in a circle working off of each other. I don't know exactly how she did this, but to achieve such a terrific spirit is testimony to what an incredible artist is Wu Man. There is no one like her. Having caught her in concert with Yo Yo Ma's Silk Road Ensemble, I can tell you that she is the glue that holds down the entire effort. She dances with her instrument, sometimes literally, and has so given herself over to the confidence of Music, that no one or ensemble is ever the same thereafter.  I would encourage you to seek out any Wu Man project, but especially FROM A DISTANCE, possibly the finest CD of this new century. WU MAN AND FRIENDS is a worthy addition to her canon.
