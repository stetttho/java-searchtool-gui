 .... yeah, and if there is a more perfect match in the pure musicality of this release, it would only be in Emmy Lou's pairings with Neil Young. The story here is that these two have been planning on collaborating for a decade or more and finally got it all focused for this effort. It's terrific. I happen to like K's RAGPICKER"S DREAM and Harris's WRECKING BALL more, but that's quibbling. Here the Notting Hillbilly and the Sweetheart of the Rodeo combine to pressent a set of songs that will carry you away. All of K's best traits are on display: the fretwork, the odd stories in the songs, the low grumble of his baritone. Harris, well, is there a finer singer around? She brings a level of grace to every project, even with a toad like Costello, she raises the quality of an endeavour to a shimmering level. Emotion, passion, depth, she has it all in spades, and apart from either Young or Parsons, I can't think of a better vocal pairing than with K.  As a record, this hasn't the devastating song cycle of Harris's STUMBLE INTO GRACE. But you can't do that every time out anyway. What's key to this is that the collection picks up where The Notting Hillbillies left off, as worthy a side project as The Travelling Willburys. To that end, K delivers a Brit's take on roots americana, with the added dimension of Harris's authenticity. You will continue to listen to this for a very long time. Much has been made of the solo on the last cut. I'm not as impressed, not that there's a thing wrong with it, but you have to remember "Brothers In Arms," "Cal," Local Hero," among others. In any case, this is a terrific release that will hopefully keep Knopfler from feeling he has to generate another money for nothing. This one is on the money.
