 From the master guitarist of Mali (believe it or not, he's been called in Brit folk magazines the Neil Young of Mali - ?????), here is a CD of deep and soulful music beautifully played. Traore puts me in mind of Mississippi Fred McDowell in the unaffected way he picks the guitar and in the deeply human pain that infuses his voice. The winds of the dessert blow through this man's voice. He has lived this music and it comes with all the mystic, griot power of truth handed down the ages. This, like many of his recent CDs, is so genuinely delivered that its subtlety easily washes over you. You will find yourself replaying this often to get every bit of news our each note. There is so much on offer.
