 One of the things that you can go to the bank on with a John Hiatt disc is that it will be great. It's only a question of how great, and in a career that has had a tremendous amount of high water marks, this is an outstanding CD, possibly his best. All of the songs, from the self-deprecating opening title track through to the end are exceptional, classic, superb in every detail. Whether he's referencing his Welsh roots (what I'd give to see Hiatt and John Tams in concert together!), singing about his Thunderbird or the way a love crosses over a mighty river in a Hoosier take on Orpheus and Eurydice, Hiatt delivers compelling lyrics and driving rhytms in each song. Accompanied by the North Mississippi All Stars, Hiatt has a killer session group to execute these jems. They have an innate sense of where Hiatt is coming from, and play to the finesse of the song. They might be the best collection of musicians working today. What you notice straight out is the drumming. Hiatt has worked with some of the best (Jim Keltner, for one), but every tune throughout the CD seems to jump at you because of the sophisticated groove laid down. The Dickinson family rose to the challenge in production and execution and whether it is a hard rockin work out or one of Hiatt's classic ballads, every aspect of each song resonates incredibly. This is a band to tour with, and if so, sell your house to get out and see them. Hard to imagine a better CD. When you think about how disappointing or formulaic most established rock acts get by this point in their careers, it is a cold and refreshing blast whenever Hiatt appears. Costello, Jagger, and a whole litany of also rans should take note. Even Neil Young could take a serious woodshedding session with Hiatt to get back to what he does best. And doing what you do best should be dharma enough for anybody. Get this disc. It simply doesn't get any better.
