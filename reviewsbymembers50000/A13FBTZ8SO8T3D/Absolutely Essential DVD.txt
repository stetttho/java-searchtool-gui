 I'm so happy that this has been released. Sawallisch is not in good health, and he worked miracles in Philadelphia, without the benefit of a recording contract, and in spite of the contrary nature of too many orchestra players. Sawallisch was a master of Strauss and if you were ever lucky enough to catch any of his readings with the Phil O, you know this was as sublime as music could be. This performance on DVD is one of those especially brilliant moments when it all came together. It is also a great, great thing that the Rautavarra is reworked. The initial perfomance in Philadelphia, for which the symphony was commissioned, was flubbed in a couple of spots. There must have been some disappointment when Ondine opted for another reading from a different orchestra when this first appeared on CD. Leif Segerstam and the Helsinki Philarmonic created a brilliant disc. Guess what? This is even better. In so many ways, having a second shot at it, perhaps living with it for a while, all seems to have given Philadelphia a much better handle on the nuances. There is the sentimental aspect too that this marvellous and gracious conductor is perhaps looking back on his life's journey as well. Classical music owes Wolfgang Sawallisch a great deal of gratitude for all the grace and subtle power he brought to the repertoire he interpreted. This is as great a valedictory as any conductor could hope for, every bit as emotional as Knappertsbusch's final "Parsifal". This is beautifully shot and an awe-inspiring listen. I hope this is enough to get a record company back interested in Sawallisch's performances in Philadelphia. They were legendary and should be shared with the world.
