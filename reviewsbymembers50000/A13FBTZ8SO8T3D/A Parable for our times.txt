 The central issue of this film is whether or not the "eye for an eye" approach to terrorism simply adds fuel to the fire, which, when you think about it, this theology of retribution is what has poisoned the world since Cain whacked Abel. With the clarity of hindsight, Spielberg's nerve-wracking account of the revenge visited upon the Arab murderers of Munich makes the case quite boldly that, as Eric Bana's character points out, when you kill off these villains, more and worse replace them. It's a bit like cancer, isn't it? You think you have it irradicated, then a relapse, only it's worse. Perhaps this was the defining flash point, in much the same way that Derry & Bloody Sunday ignited the Northern Ireland bloodbath. If so, certainly the world was never the same after Munich. The world's never the same after any human tragedy of such unrelenting violence, be it Bosnia, WW2, Viet Nam, 9-11. There's no shortage of trigger points that would seem to argue for us to consider another way of dealing with such deep and festering ills, but don't. Well, all but for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which it mat come to before the Middle East becomes enlightened, as it were. As for the film, it's a very gripping and powerful story. The actors are remarkable in their roles - from Eric Bana, to the little girl who plays the daughter of one of the Muslim lynchpins of Munich, each and every character is spot on. Bana delivers a soulful portrayal of a man who arrives at a moral crossroads, or perhaps, more accurately, realizes he has crossed an immoral threshold, especially when one of his colleagues, the bombmaker, pleads for justice as an obligation that must be revered and honoured. There are many disturbing moments throughout the film, and the toll they take on Bana become so heavy you'll find yourself not bearing up very well under their weight. For me, it was the murder of the Dutch spy on her boat. The obscenity of the revenge will knock the wind out of you. I'm still quite upset by it. Daniel Craig is frighteningly menacing as a Jewish assasin who has no moral qualms about the job he must do. He is, in many ways, the ideological antipode to Bana: one becomes less convinced and one becomes more convinced of the ethics of their assignment as the killings go on and the counterattack from the Muslims seeks to trump them. Duplicity abounds among the hidden players, most notably the Americans. At some point, even though this is just a movie, you wonder when the US citizenry will wake up to the way their governments repeatedly play both sides of the street. Give the Israeilis their due: they mean what they say. For the matter, so do the Muslim extremists, but Bush will figure that out when Iran strikes back. Back here in the early 70's, when terrorism honestly shocked you as abhorrent, the opportunity to consider how to redress the roots of this issue pass. Bana and an Arab extremist share a safe-house in one of the most ironic sequences of the story. The Arab resolve to never give in resonates with Bana's character. For Craig's character, that is simply a call to go to the mattresses and deliver the final blow, for Bana, it underscores the vicious circle they have all played themselves into. Craig is superb. This bodes well for the next James Bond film, if the franchise owners can manage to hire a writer who can deliver a story instead of an infomercial. He went from this film to LAYER CAKE, one of the best Britfilms ever. Hopefully, he will insist on the edgy danger he seems to generate. I did not get the edition with all the special stuff on it, but I'm told it's as well. The special edition apparently tends to cheapen the experience of the ethical questions this film raises. Better it should be so hard to find. In the end, I can't help but hear "Blood On The Rooftops," the Steve Hackett song from Genesis' WIND AND WUTHERING CD of the mid-70's:             "Seems Helen of Troy              has found a new face, today."
