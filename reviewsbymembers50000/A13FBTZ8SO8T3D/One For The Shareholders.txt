 There is nothing to carp about with the song selection and it is indeed a mighty selection. However, editing choices were made that relegate this release as one to fatten the shareholders of those remarkable back catalogue bonds. I would tell you to skip this set all together and purchase the 3 disc LIVE AT THE BBC.  For the sake of being overly inclusive, this set cuts Robert Fripp's guitar solos on HEROES, ASHES TO ASHES & FASHION! Ques ka freck! Compound this idiocy with including the duet with Jagger (and really who cares if they ever went to naughty places) and the buggering is to any serious fan of Bowie. I'm glad an effort was made to include some truly great stuff from the 90's and the twenty-first century, but perhaps, then, overplayed tunes like CHANGES (hardly a masterpiece for all its popularity) or softballs like PUTTING OUT FIRE WITH GASOLINE could have been left off to allow disc space.  So, skip it. Prudential doesn't need to rip you off in music as well as in insurance.
