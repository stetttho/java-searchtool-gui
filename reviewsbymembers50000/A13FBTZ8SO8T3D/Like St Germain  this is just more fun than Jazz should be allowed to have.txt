 Someone's gonna have to break this down for Wynton: It's fun, Mate! Oh yeah, remember that?! Anyway, the DJs and producers here take tracks you're likely to know, if you have an avocation for jazz, and give them, if you will, a different spin. And it's infectiously a hoot! Of course, Dizzy Gillespie would have revelled in the joyful tricks effected on his track, but you can't help but see the wry smile on all of these musicians, including Mingus, on the way these tracks have found another life. Like turning a diamond just so so atht it's facets cast a new brilliance. It all winds up with a reverent and inspirational reading of a poem by John Coltrane, set to music by his son. It's just perfect! Keep this up and Impulse might just breathe life back into Jazz a second time. It reminds me of the old Teilhard de Chardin quote: "When man learns to harness the power of love, he will have discovered fire for the second time." Coltrane's poem is all about the peace such discovery brings the heart. Git it in your soul, as Mingus would have told you. You, too, Wynton.
