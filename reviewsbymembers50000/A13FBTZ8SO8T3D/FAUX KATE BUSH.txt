 There isn't an authentic bone in this one's entire effort. I have never been a fan and have found that at best it was spurious to make a quick buck off your own rape, but then I wasn't a failure as a Joan Jett wanna-be. In the absence of Kate Bush ( and rumour has it, Kate is about to fill that void, thankfully) there have been a number of pretenders to the artistic throne, and this one, in particular has always struck me as a fraud. Complete with castles in Ireland, cottages in England and probably a trailer in Des Moines, Amos can't quite decide if she's Kate, Enya or JK Rowling, or just the tie-dyed Gretchen Wilson. Whatever. This is a re-tread of every scale ascending knock-off of Kate Bush riffs in the book, complete with a book! this time atesting to her apiary mysticisms. Even Sarah McLaughlin and Loreena McKennit aren't this contrived.  Nothing wrong with the music, but like Enya, you have heard it all before. In fact you've heard it everytime out. I kinda miss the way she used to suckle pigs, I guess it's a dicier prospect with bees. No matter. If it's naft sentiments and histrionic scale warbling you crave, you've got it here in spades.  For those waiting for Kate to return, apparently, the wait is coming to an end. Hopefully, at that point, the pretenders will all go away.
