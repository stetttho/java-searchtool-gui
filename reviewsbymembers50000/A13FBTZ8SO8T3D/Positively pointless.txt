 This was an excuse to squeeze a few more bucks out of the fan base with a folksy cover painting by Mitchell as the only substantive addition. This is the band for whom context was everything, and taking these songs out of their sequence strips them of their emotional whallop. Skip this, You don't need it. Better you had only 1 of their truly remarkable efforts than to get saddled with something that has no meaning.
