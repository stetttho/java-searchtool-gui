 At a certain point, Mitchell realized that jazz musicians could liberate her music from its past in ways she couldn't do herself or with her usual back up colleagues. This grouping of jazzmen was inspired. Lyle Mays, Jaco Pastorius, Michael Brecker and Pat Metheny set the gold standard for her performances, a standard she's be hard pressed to match thereafter. This is a terrific listening experience, rewarding from almost every conceivable perspective. The musicians here changed her and she herself responded with challenges to her own abilities. I wish I had caught this tour. Pastorious is possessed, Mays is at his impressionistic best and Metheny is a foil for Mitchell the likes of which she'd never again replicate. Becker brings that East Coast jazz vibe that only he can muster and he is incendiary, smokey, subtle and brilliant. As other reviews have pointed out, the video is at times too naff for words. Artistic pretensions or literal images absolutely take the whole thing down a notch. But the sound as presented on this DVD is extraordinary, so if the images are that stupid, just listen to it. It is a sublime reward, and perhaps the single strongest vindication of Mitchell's jazz aspirations. Sheer genius.
