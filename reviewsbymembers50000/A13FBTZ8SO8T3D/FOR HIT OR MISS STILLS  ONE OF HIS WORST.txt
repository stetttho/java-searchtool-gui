 There is nothing to recommend this album. The toll drugs and alcohol were taking on his skill and his ego were at their devastating worse here. The songs are terrible, the arrangements lacluster and the recording quality a real mess. If someone gives this to you, slap them with it. The masters of this should be destroyed at once.
