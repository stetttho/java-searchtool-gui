 If you are a classicist that gets the willies when 20th Century music is mentioned, you would be doing yourself a favour by investigating the works of Chinese composer Bright Sheng. This was my first dip into the China Sea and what a rewarding experience it has been. I return to this disc frequently because I find myself transported away, not in some sentimental guaze, but on the ether of dreams. There is something quintessential and compelling to the human soul in this music that gets to you way beyond the cultural differences that might exist.
