 This may be one of those works that is impossible to perform badly, well, unless you are The Philadelphia Orchestra, whose monumental flub in the tranquillo section was astounding, especially given that Rautavarra had written the piece for them and it was the world premier and he was there! No wonder they don't have a recording contract. In any case, this recording is the full measure of the journey of a life and vanska and team perform as one organic being, fully aware of the assailing winds, the ferocious tides as well as the moments of tranquility that infuse a life with its grand meaning. There is a difference to the Segerstam version. This is taken more melancholically, and coupled with the violin concerto, it makes for a powerfully emotional recording. But it is the kind of emotion that comes with age, not hormones, and as a result, the incredible profundity of the piece is articulated with just enough difference as to make both versions worth owning. I happen to think that neither Vanska nor Segersttam can do anything less than a compelling recording anyway, so I'm biased. Apparently GRAMAPHONE feels the same way. I'd say this is your best Classical CD of the year, and it's only the 18th of January!
