 Ian Anderson has delivered what is the best Holiday set of music this side of Bruce Cockburn and Emmylou Harris. Along with his bandmates, the CD and the accompanying DVD, present the time of year with a distinctive English feel. Perhaps it is an England gone now to the force of globalization, but be it his sardonic liner notes or the dramatically re-worked Tull and Christmas chestnuts that he is roasting, the music herein lives with a sense of passion about the need for what a winter solstice brings to the soul. I daresay I like this version of "Christmas  Song" and "Ring out Solstice Bells" even better than the originals. I'd say this is essential holiday mischief making, and you'd have expect Ian to come round as a wren boy. The gratias at the end of the notes are comical: nearly everyone thanks the instrument manufacturers and so you can not help but wonder if there isn't a tongue out of flute and firmly in cheek, like thanking the manufacturers for the toys. All except Dave Pegg, God Bless him, who thanks "his lucky stars and everyone."  Indeed.
