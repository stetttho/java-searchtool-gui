 Crosby and Nash, the huggy buddies of folk rock, were heading out on their own after the mid-air ego collisions of CSNY. Their shows were often loose, relaxed outings wherein they sought to get away from obsessing on their own material. Congenial enough, and often funny in a burn-out kind of way, they would tackle songs that had established their careers as they cast about for a defining direction, which would arrive later with WIND ON THE WATER. This is very emblamatic of their shows at the beginning. Sometimes the harmonies would lock in beautifully, sometimes they were singing in 2 entirely different scales, metres and rhythms. If you were stoned enough, you could tell yourself this was jazz.  Right. Anyway, the guitar work here is a bit primitive. The songs are heavily weighted toward Crosby's strengths, but the camaradarie seems genuine. There is a tragic innocence about these two. Neither of them realized the trajectory they were on. There was a pinnacle still to reach, but when you hear the two of them joke about the Lebanese flu, it's kind of pathetic. More's the pity. The song collection is the usual catalogue, drawing heavily on Crosby's solo record and Nash's CSN work. It is nice to hear them so unadorned, but it aint real professional, and you know, any struggling songwriter would never be able to get away with this. This isn't the holy grail it purports to be, but it has historical value. Now that most of us are clean and sober, this really comes off as sloppy nostalgia. Thanks to the Grateful Dead? Maybe.....
