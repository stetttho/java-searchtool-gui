 Roy Hargrove's CDs are always great, and this one continues the tradition, adding a danceability and soul to the proceedings. Imagine Miles and Al Green working together, and you pretty much have the feel of this album. It is romantic, seductive, fun in ways that almost no other cross-fertilization like this has ever been. I'm amzed that a good dozen or so years after Miles' death, people are finally catching on to what he did all those years ago. Roy Hargrove is his own man entirely, but shares Miles' spirit to go for what interests him first. In this CD, he presents music he feels recalls the stuff he listened to growing up, and there is a joyous danceability to the whole disc. The recording process was similar to Miles approach: everyone in the studio and let's roll the tape. The results are terrific. Meshell Ndegeocello, Steve Coleman, Erykah Badu and QTip are just some of the collaborators. Be it the slow soul of "Ill Stay" or Badu's remarkable "Poetry", the lyric end of the disc is both reminiscent and foreward-looking. Through it all the music carries you along in a delicious state of intoxicating rhythms. "Forget Regret" is a complete triumph, "Hardgroove" picks up right where Miles laid the trumpet down in '75, "How I know" is equal parts Parliament, Marvin, Rev Green. You'll have a great time with this disc. Absolutely brilliant, start to finish.
