 Well, this is the gem of the entire CSNY catalogue! Crosby and Nash never sounded better, never played better, never wrote better, and their back up band was spot on from the first note to the last. I remember walking down Bloor Street when I first heard this from a record shop. I was hooked. I wore out 6 vinyl copies of this.  Crosby and Nash seemed positively liberated from the chains that went with being in the Supergroup that was more ego than substance. For all of Neil's posturings, at this point in their career, Cros and Nash were the best songwriters in rock music, touching on themes of life, death, love and environment with a poignancy any writer would sell their soul for. "Carry Me" has come back to me as a source of comfort several times when I've lost friends to Aids/Cancer/Tragedy. "Mama Lion" is a wonderful tribute to a lover who has so affected your life that even though you are no longer with him/her, it is their positive influence, not the negative that lives with you, eh Nina? "Wind on the Water" is the quintessential environmental track, and Nash hit his zenith here as a creative writer. Sheer profundity as Cros would often comment. "Cowboy of Dreams" would reference Neil more accurately than anything I've ever heard or read. The musicianship is a wonder to behold on this: looser, now that they were both free of Stills' maniacal control issues and Neil's passive aggressive mind games, this is the essence of what David and Graham were capable of. Live, they were tremendous during this period. That probably fed Crosby's ego enough to convince himself that he was handling his drug problems. Six to nine months after this, he was teetering on becoming useless as a creative songwriter. Well, this was still to come.  At this point, with this release, they were brilliant. It is evident in the confidence seen on their faces in the cover photo, and it carries all the way through every single track. Well done, a true diamond.
