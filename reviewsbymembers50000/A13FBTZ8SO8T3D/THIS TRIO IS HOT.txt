 The Ahn Trio, who, I believe, are based in Vienna, have released their third CD and they just keep getting better and hotter. Absolutely the sexiest trio in Classical music, they have a take no prisoner's approach to their music that is breathtaking.  As with the previous AHN-PLUGGED, the women cover a pop tune with a 21st century sensuality that makes the concept of chamber music a much steamier affair than one usually thinks. Poor Ludwig would have lost his concentration for sure writing for 3 dearly beloveds as these. So, while the previous effort took a very creative spin with David Bowie's "Heroes", this one begins with the Doors' chestnut "Riders on the Storm." The interplay among piano and cello on this tune showcase the warmth these women bring to their material.  From there, they essay the romantic leanings of Micahel Nyman's "Yellow Beach," passionately tango with Piazzolla's "Milonga del angel" and stretch out on the more adventurous and avant garde treatments of suites from Maurice Jarre and Kenji Bunch, who wrote his composition for the Ahn sisters. It all concludes with the mysterious lullabye from Ronn Yedidia. I listen to this disc a lot, and though there might be some high brow skepticism when you have 3 very hot Korean women casually gracing the cover, the music is absolutely top notch, and I'd stand in line for days for the opportunity to catch them live. They are the real deal, and a careful listen to any of their three CDs will convince you that there's juice left in classical music to spare.
