 For once, ironic as it may strike you, Neil has embraced a sonic upgrade. The Grandaddy of grunge and the first take is good enough has wrapped his flannel sleeves around DVD Audio like a long awaited lover, and the format has responded well by showcasing what a joy and a revolution his protean catalogue has been. Inspite of the many bone-headed releases, and he holds a record for sustaining a career inspite of himself, Ol' Shakey has had some incredible efforts, the highlights of which are included here. Pick up any of his DVD Audio releases and you'll discover his stuff as though for the first time.

Let's just say it took a Canadian to point out the inconsistencies in the first Bush administration. Keep on rockin in the free world, Yank, you've near bankrupted it. Argentina or Brazil, anyone?
