 As brilliant and as much fun as STOP MAKING SENSE was if you were there or just saw the film, this double disc of both early and middle period TH is just as incandescent. The original double LP was my favourite TH set, and now it finally arrives complete with expanded material that represents the full concerts from each epoch. And what a band they were! Punk was never this brainy, articulate, fun and edgy before or after. They were as important to 20th Century music and culture as any band , and quirky enough to move your mind as well as your butt. The first disc lays out the mission statement of attempting to be as experimental as Bowie without the psycho-sexual identity crises. David Byrne, transplanted Scot, is about the only creative artist able to do that. The music is angular, at times, especially with the early compositions, amateurish, and yet absolutely convincing. There's something not-right about Byrne and it gets inside of you and makes you consider your own existence with a sense of humour. Disc 2 is just astounding! Maybe the best Live CD ever! And the star is Adrian Belew. Nothing in their canon would have prepared you for FEAR OF MUSIC or REMAIN IN LIGHT (BEST CD of the 70's and 80's). When they took the show out, only Belew could have made it real, and he is simply amazing. Elephant Talk? Hell, the entire herd ran rampant throughout his blistering solos and his insistence on pushing the band as far to the avant-edge as it was possible to go. This collection is so good with the added material that it was worth the wait. If you were a fan, stop reading and order this RIGHT NOW. If you're new, oh boy, are you in for a treat!
