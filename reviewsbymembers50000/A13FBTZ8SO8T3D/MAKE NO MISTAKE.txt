 This is the absolute barometer of how superficial the western world is. No wonder the Arabs are pissed. For the cretin nation, just so you know, there is a world of great music beyond what the Grammy's endorse. For every George Harrison acknowledgement, there are way too many Shania Twains, Beyonce, Pinks, Kastoffs, poptrash, regardless of how it is produced to justify the fetsihization of hip-pop idols. And to think God got steamed when a golden calf was worshipped..... So, threaten yourself, check out blues, jazz, classical and world musics, dig into your own heritage, be prepared to discover how completely moving music can be when free of awards, consumerism and egoism. Make a point of not buying the mind numbing narcotics Michael Greene and the entire record industry wants you to support (they've made plenty, they don't need your hard earned punts.).
