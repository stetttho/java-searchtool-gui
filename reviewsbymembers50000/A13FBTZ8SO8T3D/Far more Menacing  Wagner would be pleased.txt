 Howard Shore has done as admirable a job with the music for this trilogy as Peter Jackson has with the narrative, and this soundtrack is as menacing and as evocative of Wagner as the first was mystical and romantic, also a bit like RW.  This is a war movie and the music evokes the dread and the violence about to be let loose. Throughout the course of the film, the music wonderfully heightened the suspense, and as a separate listening experience, this is as creepy as Mike Oldfield's "Tubular Bells" way back when being a Catholic Priest was an heroic occupation. In addition, Shore has enlisted the remarkable vocal talents of a number of World Music singers, including Sheila Chandra and Elizabeth Fraser, who happily make you forget the new age monotony of Enya (I still have a reward on offer for anyone who can tell one Enya Cd from the next). Anyway, the lower regester elements of the music rumble in your chest and the strings seem to rub your anxieties raw. This is great stuff and since the movie is not resolved at this stage, then the music must by force leave you feeling that nothing has taken away the dread. Shore is a great writer and these 2 scores contribute enormously to his well earned fame.
