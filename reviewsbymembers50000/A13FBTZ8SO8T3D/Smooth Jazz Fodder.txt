 When Steely Dan is on, they are capable of the twists in lyric, chord progression and melody line that haven't been heard since Thelonius Monk. They are not on with this release. It reminds me of GAUCHO, which had all the trappings of a band exhausted. This sounds a lot like that. Nothing grabbed me, there are no distinguishing solos, the songs are by no means memorable. And who told Fagan to sing through a sock? Skip it. This is for shopping malls, whatever bars yuppies hang out in, Smooth jazz afficianados (kind of like preferring Dairy Queen to Ben and Jerry).
