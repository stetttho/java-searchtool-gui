 Knopfler has always, from the very first DS record, turned out albums that sounded incredibly brilliant. The hallmarks of that band were its pristine definition as well as its seamless sophistication. Those admirable qualities enhanced great songs. In this new edition, in time for the holidays, Knop has culled a best od DS and his own work, and while I would have loved to see "Money for Nothing" omitted and "Lady Writer" included, at least Money is buried far enough down the track list on Disc one as to be easily forgettable. That's a song that outlived its shelf life on the first go 'round and should hereafter be retired. The rest is hard to argue with, and the inclusion of the themes from "Local Hero" and "Cal" two of the best soundtracks anyone has ever written, are the perfect transition from DS to the solo career. Pity he couldn't squeeze a Notting Hill tune in or the odd collaboration with Atkins, but maybe on Volumes 3 & 4, he'll correct all that. For the moment, this is an extremely listenable and highly enjoyable collection that sounds better than you have any right to expect. The presence and the definition, the subtle things going on in the background of the songs have more clarity than they ever did, and that's saying something! As an added treat, the whole collection finishes with a song from the forthcoming Knop/Emmy Lou Harris disc! Inspired! I can hardly wait! Among a collection of amazing songs, this one jumps out and tackles you where you stand. Great stuff!
