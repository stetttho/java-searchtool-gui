 As a fundraiser for his subatnce abuse clinic, this festival will hopefully raise a lot of money and awareness, whether you play or not. As a guitarist, what is assembled here is simply a master class of some of the greatest living guitarists (well, ZZ Top excluded) extremely well photographed and often quite intelligently commenting on what it is about their craft that compels them to play. And it is a GREAT show. The sound is terrific in 5.1, and the pace is brilliantly executed. The intersecting of various parts of the festival in a non-linear mode enhances the interest visually and musically. The different stages, the times of day, the sizes of the audiences, all change enough that you have a more compelling document, and it is not so cliched in building to an inevitable conclusion. Through out the film, Clapton is positively sublime, whether as sideman in support, or taking the lead. It is not a film about him, though, and it is a credit to his integrity that he keeps the focus on the diversity. You're not likely to appreciate each and every artist, but that's what makes the film so great. This is a terrific Christmas present for the six stringer in your home. You could never pay for the lessons imparted here.
