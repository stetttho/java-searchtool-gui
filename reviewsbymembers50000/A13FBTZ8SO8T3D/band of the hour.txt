 This is an artistic triumph on every conceivable level. Unless Eddie Vedder's voice and the general melancholy of PJ's observations put you totally off, if you are otherwise in any way curious about why this band gets the attention it does, this double live document will answer every question categorically.  This is an acoustic run on some of a number of songs that usually weren't part of the live set. There are obvious omissions and that is just fine, as it allows the band to dig deeply into songs like "Nothing As It Seems", "Man of the Hour", and a remarkable workout on Dylan's "Masters of War", as timely a piece as you'll ever hear. The essential point they establish is that they are committed to looking deeply into the human situation and while they are never the rosiest in outlook, the existential truth about them is that they have an unerring ability to tap the raw nerve. It's a pity they did not work more with Neil Young, mostly for Young's benefit, but also from the standpoint that they embrace an aesthetic that was quintessentially Young in works like ON THE BEACH, ZUMA, AFTER THE GOLD RUSH. In so many respects these are the colleagues Young should have bonded with, and we might have been spared some of the Gomer releases Shakey has put out. What counts is that this band, much like Albert Finney's character in BIG FISH, gets inside the truth and turns it in ways so that you can not run from it. The performance herein was for the benefit in Seattle of the Youth Care organization, a fine example of how genuinely theu give back to the community. They are the genuine article as men, and as artists, toning down the amps and letting the music pour through in an unaffected fashion shows just how strong their songs are. It's the band of the hour....
