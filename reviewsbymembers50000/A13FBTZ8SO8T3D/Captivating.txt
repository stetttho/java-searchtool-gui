 You could criticize this CD on a number of fronts, and most would be valid, but still I find it to be a captivating disc. Yes, PMG recycles some themes from previous recordings, but so did Miles, Diz, Trane, and countless others. The point is that reworked in a larger context, they have a renewed energy and direction, like turning a diamond to capture the light in a different way. I'm not sure how the track breaks were decided, and there is a sense of arbitrariness to this element, yet I found myself really paying no heed to the breaks. In fact, the whole is so much more than the sum of its parts, that you just have to get past it and let the music stand on its own. It stands up much better than SPEAKING OF NOW. The personnel are essentially Metheny, Mays, Rodby and Sanchez. Cuong Vu, Richard Bona and the Swiss guy are along for some texture, but this is really a guitar disc with keyboards, bass and drums and it plays to Metheny's strengths: soundscapes that suggest the urban and the pastoral. There is a lot less of the global element in this disc, and to my ears, the main quartet still seems to close ranks from letting protean talents like Vu or Bona move the music away from the PMG trademark. There are no soaring vocals on this disc, and I for one applaud that. That was getting as irritating as Jarrets' grunts. Instead, you have four extended improvisations, or semi-improvisations, that will live with you. Any hummable tunes? No. A logical catharsis? Nope. A little to avant-smooth? Maybe. But it is for PMG a more concrete way to begin again. I know I'll return to this disc a lot, especially when I need to concentrate, for it does inspire concentration. This is not his best, but it is a very fine effort and raises the question more inescapably, where is PMG going in its upward trajectory?
