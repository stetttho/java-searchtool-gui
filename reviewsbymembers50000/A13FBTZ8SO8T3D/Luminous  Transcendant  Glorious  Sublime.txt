 I first heard of Hans Knappertsbusch via a reference in "Inspector Morse: The Remorseful Day" when Morse corrects Lewis on his pronunciation of the conductor's name as Morse encourages Lewis to persevere with Wagner. Shortly after I went back to my notes from German classes at Georgetown under Anton Lang to find to my surprise references Dr Lang made to performing "Parcifal" under Knappertsbusch's direction in Bayreuth in the 50's. A week later the reissue of this title from the Westminster label appeared and I knew I must get it.  What a revelation! This is extraordinary music. The Bruckner has very much a Wagnerian feel to it, and yet the passion with which it is performed is totally breathtaking. You will sit transfixed many times through these discs. It is very hard not to be moved by this music. And to fill out the second disc there are a number of selections from various orchestral segments of Wagner's operas that float like tone poems and get inside your soul. Knappertsbusch must have been thoroughly possessed by the music. I do not know how one could evince such stirring, glorious, sublime performances from several orchestras and make the double disc seem seemlessly recorded. Westminster had a number of legendary treasures in its vaults. Hopefully, there is more of Knappertsbusch. Hans has more luminous interpretative devotion to Music than all the wonderfully coiffed media type conductors of today put together. Even if you have problems with Wagner's anti-semitic politics, Knappertsbusch breathes mysticism into the music itself. This should not be missed by anyone. It is a shame I can give it only 5 stars, it is so much better than that!
