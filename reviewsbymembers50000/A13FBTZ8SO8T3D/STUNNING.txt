 This one is a keeper. The three concertos are delivered with an intensity and a passion that belies the fact that three orchestras, three different recording studios, three different soloists were pulled together to create a seamless articulation. Boulez, to his credit, holds down the center and this remains a wonder to listen to. Taken sequentially, it is an ideal program. Zimmerman tackles the first concerto with the technical prowess it requires. so much so that that the second seems to flow as a logical counterpoint. By the time you reach Helene Grimaud's poetic take on the third, you will find yourself aware how much these artists have delivered Bartok's life story. It simply is sublime and inspiring.
