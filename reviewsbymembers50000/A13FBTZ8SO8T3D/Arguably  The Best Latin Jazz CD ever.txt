 Carlos Santana was at the top of his powers as a guitarist, in full command of the riches treasures of his cultural heritage and on fire with his new found spiritual devotion when he recorded this brilliant testament. This is an absolutely must-have, DID, whatever you want to call it CD. Somehow you should not be allowed to escape the wheel of reincarnation without absorbing the spiritual dimensions of this music. There is only Coltrane's LOVE SUPREME that stands in the same light. Having said that, the remastering done for this release is spectacular. t is positively gorgeous all the way through. You will swear you are heaing this for the first time. I loved this record on vinyl and felt the first CD pressing did it a great disservice. The restoration here, however, is to be applauded. Throughout this disc, Santana was wroking with the core of the group he had assembled to break into and light aflame the muisc world when he emerged from San Francisco. He was never to really find the same spirit of mission in any later works. All of this ensembles efforts are extraordinary, and this one in particular comes from someplace very deep in the devotional soul of a very fine human being. This is GREAT MUSIC lovingly and respectfully restored to it first and undeniable power.
