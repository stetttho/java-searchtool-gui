 Nowhere near the disappointment of DRAMA or TALK, TORMATO is nonetheless quite a letdown after the brilliant GOING FOR THE ONE. it's a pity, as "Mardigal" and "Onward" and "On the Silent Wings of Freedom (partially)" hold up well after all this time, and the bonus material here is actually better than what the official selections were. "Abilene" is great. In fact, taken as a whole, tracks 9 through 17 are much better than the official album. Among the big problems here is Wakeman. His synth sounds are grating and shrill. His contributions really disturb the flow throughout this CD. "Don't Kill the Whale" is just a huge mistake start to finish and Anderson should never be forgiven for articulating allow as AElauw. Wakemen's solo is so annoying that I remember throwing away the first pressing of this I had. From the notes it is clear that neither he nor Howe could manage to get their hat sizes to shrink. Some of the subject matter is Anderson at his loopiest: "Circus of Heaven" and "Arriving UFO". By this stage in the game, Eddie Offord's absence was really showing. They seemed to have no compass. This is what punk was rebelling against. The smashed tomato is appropriate, whether intended that way originally or not. And yet, listen to "Madrigal" and "Onward" and there are just supreme accomplishments to be found as well. In any case, this would do them in. DRAMA was to follow, as low a point as they would hit. At the price offered, it is worth picking up for the bonus stuff, more than the original material. How many CDs can you say that about?
