 Cameroon's Richard Bona returns with a disc of African based jazz that resounds far more convincingly than anything he has done to date. Sure, he still has some American artists, most notable Kenny Garrett, on board, but this CD is more dedicated to the music that comes from his heart not just his intellectual interests. And with Garrett, he has a perfect collaborator. Garrett is a world musician in every sense. Bona's time on tour with Pat Metheny never took Metheny where Metheny should have gone, as you will no doubt see in the SPEAKING OF NOW DVD. Bona's protean bass work and soaring vocals and incredible songwriting were never fully utilized. Kind of like having Barry Bonds as a pinch hitter. Perhaps it brough Bona to a broader audience than might otherwise find him. Still in all, he is better off working in other contexts. Here, from the opening INCANTATIONS through to the conclusion, you have a man who brings forth his soul as eloquently as you'll ever hear, this side of Bobby McFerrin. Garrett's contributions are just perfect. In fact, the entire team has produced a remarkable document. This Cd is an absolute joy. Do yourself a favour and order this and REVERENCE and Huong Thanh's DRAGONFLY, on which Bona joins the Viet Namese singer, Thanh, and guitarist Nguyen Le to create one of the most captivating cross-cultural efforts ever committed to disc. Bona should be played more and hopefully there are enough like minded people out there looking for something extraordinarily creative and danceable and fun and, well, all those positive things that music can be.
