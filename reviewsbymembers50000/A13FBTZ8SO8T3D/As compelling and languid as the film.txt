 Alberto Iglesias' soundtrack for Pedro Almodovar's "Talk to Her" is as compelling a piece of 21st Century Spanish Classical music and languid sensuality as the film itself. Almodovar has a unique tack on making films, and this one is a visual stunner that is intensely augmented by this beautiful and stirring soundtrack. The orchestral pieces evoke the dramas, the comedies and the dances of this movie. The ballet of modern dancers, of a woman fighting bulls, of a young dancer practicing her steps as the two protoagonists stumble through their efforts to reach beyond their limits they impose on their lives are all evocatively drawn out in this remarkable music that often reminds me of Revoueltas. And the stunner in the film is Caetano Veloso delivering "Cucurrucucu Paloma" seaside in a Cafe with a brilliantly subtle group of accompaniests. I think this is my favourite 4 minutes of film in all the movies I have ever seen. There is drama, comedy, and as one might expect with Almodovar, the bizarre. The film is a triumph and the music is just the right ingredient to heighten deepen and accentuate the flavours of this remarkable work. Buy the disc, see the movie. It's great.
