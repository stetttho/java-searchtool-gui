 One of contemporary music's greatest musicians, Tony Levin has released his latest CD, Pieces of the Sun, and it is a bit retro, and a bit lees than what I tend to think when his name comes up. His solo efforts tend to be more tame than his collaborations in other contexts and this is no departure from that theme. It's all a bit Mike & the Mechanics and Steve Hackett, end of the 80's early 90's, and given the lineup, that's quite understandable. The music is brilliantly executed, but at the conclusion of the disc, it really doesn't stick with you. When you consider his impact in Crimson and Gabriel, that's a bit of a letdown.  There is a leftover track from a Gabriel session which illustrates the point that there usually is a profound reason why some tracks are not used and often it's good to let them be. It also underscores the notion that if it takes Gabriel 6 years to discard stuff like "Dog One", so be it. John Lennon told Levin he didn't want him to play like McCartney. At that point Levin should have gone out, bought a Hoffner bass, and rammed it upside that Japanese addled macrobiotic. Levin is not a lead player, but one who explores the depths, a submariner, instead of aJacques Cousteau, and all of his explorations enlighten the listener. You'll find no shortage of fascinating explorations here. It is just that this is a milder Levin than what you hear in other contexts.
