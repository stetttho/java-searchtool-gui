 One of the things I find it difficult to forgive Kate Bush for is abdicating her position to this harrigan. Anyway, this repertoire has always smacked of being an American version of a British genius (think Sanford versus Steptoe): all cloying imitation with precious little substance, meanwhile generating enough PR to fuel a usurpationof merit. Regardless. The point here is that if you have paid any attention to Kate Bush from the start, or even only caught her since "Running Up That Hill," you have heard every single chord progression Amos has lifted whole cloth. The videos evidence someone who has studied with incisive detail the daring and the silly that Bush presented over the course of her active engagement. In the long run, it's a bit like watching Pat Boone sing "Bluede Suede Shoes." I get why angst embracing yuppies are on to Amos, but it somehow justifies Eminem and Kurt Cobain as well. In the words of Adrian Belew, "pass me a bottle of Jack and Prozac." This is strictly preaching to the converted.
