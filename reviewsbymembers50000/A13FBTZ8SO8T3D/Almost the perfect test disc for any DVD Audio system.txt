 I'll skip the superlative merits of the songs themselves as I've covered that already, and tell you that with Knopfler you always get a GREAT sounding album. Enhanced with the DVD Audio format, it is almost too good to be true. Assuming you have a passion for well played, tasty guitar licks, it doesn't get any more sublime or sound any more intimate than this DVDA. I'd swear I can hear the strings being plucked! The balance throughout the disc is extraodinary, the dynamics letter perfect. The intimacy acheived and the presence and separation of the music is what is so incredible about this format and in the case of Knopfler, he takes the format to its optimum. Positively, I highly recommend this disc. As good as the first release was, this is just so much better. I can hardly wait for LOCAL HERO and RAGPICKER'S DREAM, CAL and TELEGRAPH ROAD.
