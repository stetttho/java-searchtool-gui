 It's very possible that the world is right and I'm all wrong, but I found this disc boring. I'm not sure what all the hub-bub is about the return of Marc Ribot as Waits' guitarist, but if he was meant to be some galvanizing catalyst for the creative juices, it somehow strikes me as only galvanizing, period. Not his fault anyway. The material here never grabbed me and I've listened thru this disc half a dozen times, convinced I was missing something. I was. But let's not get into that. Nearly as soporific as his appearance in Jarmusch's COFFEE AND CIGARETTES (one of the worst films ever made), Waits here seems equally uninspired in his delivery. There are all the usual Waits' cliches: rejects from the poetry of Charles Barkowski, but where in MULE VARIATIONS the tales seemed to tell profoundly moving stories, hillarious episodes, or bizarre incantations, here it is as though the author just whipped out his stock trademarks and took what were the most stultifying musical concepts in ALICE and BLOOD MONEY, and reset it all here.  Not until the last song on the CD does anything really happen that seems to pull on the human soul and heart, and this isn't an A list song. Unfortunately no one's told Waits that the age of hidden tracks is over, so after a boring few minutes, you get to hear a bit more of the cacphonous howling that infuses several of the tracks here. Maybe that's the point. It seems to be an album about death anyway.
