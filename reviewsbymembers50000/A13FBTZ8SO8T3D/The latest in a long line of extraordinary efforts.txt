 Clapton has emerged, particularly since McCartney's CONCERT FOR NY, and the TRIBUTE TO GEORGE as a statesman of incomparable dignity, sublime in both the finesse and creativity that he brings to efforts whose subjects he deeply respects. It is no less the case with his most recent releases, be the homages to B B King, George, his own tours, an incredible guitar festival, and now Robert Johnson. The CD is excellent - some additional material and different takes on the ME AND MR JOHNSON release, an extraordinary document in its own right.  But what takes this to an entirely different level is the DVD. A mix of recording sessions in interesting locations (Clapton's English countryside, Johnson's former recording studio) and Clapton's reflections on his approach to Johnson and his myth, most of which Eric is keen to debunk, having been the victim of enough myths to rewrite Homer himself. And it is just this effort of his to get to the music as he feels it and not take any of the side show for more than that that gets inside of you. You are not going to hear Robert Johnson completely re-worked. You're going to hear his tunes really honsetly delivered. There is a sublime beauty to that that just takes you to that very special place where MUSIC leans over and brings you into its confidence. And that seems to be the point for Clapton: to get inside that confidence in order to honour a man whose dedication and discipline inspired a poor English kid years ago to reach down deep. And on both the CD and the DVD, the music is without peer. As I say, Clapton at this point in his career has acheived a level of dignity that is to be admired.
