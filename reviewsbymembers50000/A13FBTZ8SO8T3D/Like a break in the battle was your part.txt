 Chrissie Hynde and her ensemble have stood always and ever for an independence, and in this remarkable film from MTV's Unplugged era (hey, remember when MTV had something to do with music?), that independence is so achingly poignant and terrifically presented that it nearly justifies all the other crap for which MTV has been responsible. Hynde looks great. She is no one to trifle with and that inner strength she commands is front and center. Most of us would kill for that kind of self-confidence: it aint strut and swagger, she is the real deal, the genuine article. That said, the music is rendered with a more string influenced side, and that serves to bring out the drama in the songs more ardently. "Chain Gang" is a revelation on this disc, as is "Kid", "Creep" (a nod to Radiohead before anyone knew who Tom Yorke was), "Hymn to Her." Opening with "Sense of Purpose" Hynde leads memebers of the Pretnders and a string quartet through her catalogue. It is just a greatly inspired jaunt. The sound on the DVD is stellar (MTV is capable of something), and the video swirls around in early 90's fashion, but there is a cold determination in Hynde's eyes that is unforgiving, asks and offers no quarter. The musicianship is protean. This is what real musicians do. Particularly in service to Music. And in this case, through Hynde, Music leans over and takes the audience into its confidence, delivering a textbook lesson on the metaphysics of communicating beyond words, gestures. This is all of the soul.
