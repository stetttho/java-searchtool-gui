 I, none the less, have found this film to be the most engaging of the lot and a welcome relief from the formulaic treacle of its predecessors. In fact, I was fairly prepared to pillory this film, but found instead that its darker edge and thematic touchstones profound. The film handles the finality of death more sophisticatedly than its cartoonish predecessors. Harry is growing up, and with the hormone changes and burgeoning sexual awakenings come a sense of mortality as well. Emma Watson, Rupert Grimes and Danielle Radcliffe will be tough to replace, as apparently they will be for the next film, as they have finally grown into the roles with a sense of gravitas that you don't expect from kid actors. If Radcliffe can shake his Potter role, he's likely to be a commanding presence in films. Hopefully they all fare better than Frodo. As for how much of the book is abridged, that's not something I can speak to. I can only say that the film held together well, and will leave anyone with kids plenty to talk about, and for that reason it is an extremely worthy film.
