 Los Lobos is such a protean force that whatever they do is going to get to you, but on this CD they just have too many guests and it all comes off as though they are the backing band, instead of doing their own thing. They are in real danger of becoming the Mexican Chieftains. Mind you, it is still a great CD, and when you hear Dave Alvin and Mavis Staples and Cafe Tacuba with them, there is just something so overwhelmingly right about the mix that it is entirely transcendent. "kitate" with Tom Waits is something else altogether. It arrives as a jarring interuption that seems simply to reference that Los Lobos can do abstract with the best of them, but several times through now, I pass this one over. Waits' trombone avocation is something best savoured in very small doses. Los Lobos are left to their own devices on only 4 of the tracks, and there is something less than satisfying about that. Richard Thompson, while certainly able to utter "hombre" and "amigos" like a champ, still overwhelms LOs Lobos. I think David Hidalgo is his match on the Fender, but the wolves relegate themselves to backing status here. Elvis Costello needs to go away, period. He does a better job here than he has in anything else in years, but no one needs to have Aul' Declan guest star on anything until he gets his muse back. How can I miss him if he won't go away. Bobby Womack and Little Willie G and Reuben Blades fill out the balance of the CD, but, as I said, it turns Los Lobos into Los Chieftains, a great Irish ensemble who have resorted to loading their CDs with guest appearances because their inspiration dried up. I'd hate to see that be the story here. It's been long enough, and all in their own element Los Lobosis one of the greatest bands ever. Stick to the knitting, it suits you better.
