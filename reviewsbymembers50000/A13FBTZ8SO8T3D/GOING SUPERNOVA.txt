 5 stars is nowhere near the mark for the film collection of these 2 tours. If you were fortunate enough to catch Sinead before the meltdown at the Dylan Tribute and the Peter Gabriel breakdown, you know that there has rarely been an artist who blazed across the pantheon like O'Connor, and this DVD is an absolute must. When I wandered into the Mann Music Center all those summers ago to catch a singer whose CDs were profoundly moving, I had no idea how thoroughly Sinead would shred what I thought a performer could get across. The band, including then husband John Russell, who would prove to be her most reliable confidant, included Dublin's best musicians, U2 notwithstanding. Sinead riveted your attention and she delivered her heart and soul with such an incandescent intensity that it was as though you were watching a white star go supernova. In retrospect, how could she have kept it up? In any case, the poetry of Frank Harte has never been more categorically delivered than Sinead's "I Am Stretched Out On Your Grave." She embodies the entire Gaelic and English history of Irish Poetry in this performance. The beautiful "Black Boys on Mopeds" and the ultra sexy "Nothing Compares to U" are hall marks of her early repertoire. Theses are wonderfully shot performances, and they underscore the tragedy of Sinead having lost her grip on her sanity, reality and career. Before she turned into a mess, she was the single most protean force in rock music ever. What happened was absolutely a tragedy, first for herself. Someone had the foresight to shoot these shows and preserve the tapes. They've done all who love great music and incredible performance art an enormous service. This DVD is absolutely essential.
