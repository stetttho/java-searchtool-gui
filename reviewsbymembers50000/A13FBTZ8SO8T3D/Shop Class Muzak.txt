 Well, based on the reviews, I thought I'd have a go at this band. Whoever commented that it is like Black Sabbath without the vocals has it just about right. I'll assume that was a left-handed compliment. If it wasn't, then let's be clear, Ozzy was the smart one in that band. That said, this is the kind of thudding 4/4 repititious monotonous junk you hear from machine shops, shop class, tire stores, generally low brow plodding along at one tempo, and yes, occasionally a strummed acoustic guitar. Like Wow. I'm reminded when I listen to this stuff of that greeting card with the old lady who says she'll thump your bass. Anyway, having an avocation for Derek Bailey, Robert Fripp and Steve Wilson, I found this to be simplistic neanderthal amateurish rubbish. It's a collection of drums whacked in monotonous time signatures without the slightest hint of polyrhythm or odd metre (someone send these folks a Bill Bruford record), and 2 guitars and a bass players who have a preoccupation with twiddling the gain knob on their amps. In some of the reviews, it's comical to read the outrage about "March to the Sea" being abbreviated. How could anyone tell. I mean this aint Teo Macero working with Miles Davis.  I suppose it's all harmless fun, but to me it underscores the fact that if rock isn't dead, at best, it's on life support, and based on this recording, resisting any attempts to revive creativity, nuance, a beat, a back beat, even several types of beat - what their beating about I'd rather leave where it is. Why two stars? Well, it isn't the worse record I've ever heard. Forewarned is forearmed: Caveat Emptor.
