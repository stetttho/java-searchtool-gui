 As anyone familiar with the trajectory of Bowie's career would know, the threshold he crossed with Fripp and Eno and the trio of records they did took Bowie out of, not just his addictions, but his pop-star status and placed him squarely in the serious artist with something to say. This tour flexed those new muscles with such conviction that it is almost hard to believe that the Bowie on LIVE AT THE TOWER is the same guy here. This is about when I stopped dismissing him as a chic-star. His music had something more to it besides the glamour. The star of this recording, however, is not Bowie, Belew, Alomar or any of the other superlative musicians. It is Tony Visconti. His engineering and production skills advanced the art of the LIVE recording with this disc as it had not ever been advanced before. Quite a statement when you review the material, the musicians and the performance. But make no mistake about it, the effort made to record this was of the highest calibre and Visconti delivered a Live recording for the ages. Visconti wrote the liner notes for this re-master and they are informative, to say the least. Narrowly escaping the money-grubbing clutches of Madison Square Garden, the shows were recorded eslewhere and Visconti captured the audience as brilliantly as he did Bowie. This set absolutely crackles with surprise and energy. Visconti remains one of Bowie's trusted producers and with good reason. He knows what David is looking for and he finds it. Enjoy this remaster. It is positively terrific and it should merit Visconti's inclusion in any producer and engineer's Hall of Fame.
