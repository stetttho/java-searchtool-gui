 Perhaps it's just that this is where it all began with him, but Lennon tackles this collection with more ardent affection and inspiration than he did most of his own material. McCartney and Harrison had the same affectionate nostalgia for the musics they grew up with. Don't we all? Anyway, this is a wonderful tribute to old chestnuts delivered with passion. The stand out track is, of course, "STand By Me", but the rest of the material and the additional tracks are compelling. I believe this is the set where Lennon brought Tony Levin on to play bass, admonishing him not to play like McCartney. Can you imagine? Like asking Beethoven not play like Haydn. PIss off, matey. It's a wonder Levin didn't ram a 4 string Fender up JL's liverpool. But there is no credit to the musicians on this set (come on, Yoko, what did these guys ever do). The production is Phil Spector-ish wall of noise, but Lennon carries on with brio and commitment and carries the day.
