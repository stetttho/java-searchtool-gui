 I'd have never bet it was either ontologically or metaphysically possible to deliver a CD more Dead On Arrival than anything by Diana Krall, but aul' Declan has pulled it off. This is a tuneless collection of narcotic mumbling meanderings that should come with a warning label: Do not drive a vehicle or operate machinery while listening to this disc.  I suppose reclining with the Vancouver chanteuse has convinced MacManus he's Mel Torme. PUUHHHLLEEEAAASSSSEEEEEE! Having gone through this disc twice now, I can't remember a single melody line nor even a song title. Chripes! His hat size must be enormous. Towards the end of the tird song, whatever it's called, EC intones:            And I ask can anyone see the ending? God give me strength, as he sang with Bacharach. Love is a strange drug, and in Costello's case it seems to have deadened his senses altogether. This is as bad, if not worse than THE JULLIET LETTERS. It is actually comical to see all the musicians listed, especially Peter Erskine on drums, because they are barely audible above the sound of your own nearly sleep laden breathing. Erskine is a remarkable drummer whose work with genuine jazz artists like Nguyen Le is a thing of wonder. I sincerely hope Peter never plays this disc while driving from Linwood to Somers Point, as I'd hate to see him fall asleep and crash through the flimsy bridge rails. I bought the Special Edition version and I have absolutely no interest in putting in the CD drive the special disc with a secret code. Gimme a break, It's hard to believe who Costello once was. Funny thing is, he's terrific as a stand in for David Letterman. Maybe that's what he should be doing, since he has given up writing anything that matters. Skip this, It is complete garbage. And as a Canadian, I am imploring both the uS and Ottawa governments: revoke Krall's visa, close the borders. That's enough of that dreadful drone.
