 Forget the poseurs of  tradition, this is the man with vision. Garrett's latest disc is absolutely terrific start to finish. He embraces a daring and virtuosity that has few parallels in jazz, and seems to be the leading player to enhance and advance the vision and courage from such luminaries as Wayne Shorter and John Coltrane, his predecessors with Miles Davis. He has coalesced a remarkable team of colleagues, and a producer of impeccable sensitivity and sympatico in Marcus Miller. This is a triumph from start to finish, and I would urge you to chase this one down.
