 I really like Joe Jackson, legitimately the Cole Porter of the post-punk era. His brilliant CDs, LOOK SHARP, NIGHT AND DAY, BODY AND SOUL, BIG WORLD, and all his Live CDs have been brilliant. His excursions into Classical are far more informed and on the money than his rock competitors. This CD has him reconvening his colleagues from the initial days, and it is in large, a triumph. These men play this music as though it vitally mattered, and as a way of ramping you up to this point, the first disc of this set is a Live EP of 6 terrific tunes that this quartet made famous. They still have a point to make, and it is done with commitment and gusto. Where this set starts to soften up is on disc #2. Numbers like "Fairy Dust" and "Thugs r Us" are somewhat less satisfying, and frankly seem like cast-offs. "Love at Fist Light" and "Bright Grey" are OK, but this is Joe Jackson, and you know he can be a lot more on target and a lot more compellingly musical.  However, "Chrome" and "Blue Flame" are among the best songs he has ever penned and they are a wonder in the hands of this band. "Awkward Age" is a brilliantly self-deprecating look at both a teen ager who doesn't fit in and a songwriter with the same issues. Jackson is the only writer I can think of who could sing this convincingly. I suppose this is really 3 3/4 stars. The mediocre and sub-par material should have been rejected, and if he really did not have any other tunes ready to go, a single CD with the live stuff would have made this a 5 star effort all the way. In any case, let's hope that this is not a one-off. Jackson was never so impressed with his verbosity as Costello, and his less is more, and more directly on target, has made him very really the most sophisticated of British songwriters. I look forward to his next release and hope that he continues with this quartet.
