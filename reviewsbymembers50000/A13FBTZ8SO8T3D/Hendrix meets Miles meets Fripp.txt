 As I have intoned before, you know you're getting old when you come upon something spectacular that's been out and about for 6 years. Such is the case with this release by the late English guitarist extraordinaire, Derek Bailey, and his cohorts, Jamaladeen Tacuma on bass and Calvin Weston on drums. Weston is as polyrythmic as Bill Bruford, no mean feat, and Tacuma is positively stunning with the pwoer and the bluesy funk of his commanding performance. I am not sure if this was "composed" in any way, or done a la Miles, but it rings with such sense that the intelligence, as well as the soul, of this music is the raw and real deal. My other forays into the world of Derek Bailey have included his acoustic workout with Bill Frisell and his very abstract tour de force with Pat Metheny and Paul Wertico in the SIGN OF FOUR recording, one not for the timid. Bailey passed away this past winter and with his passing a very unique artist, and influential musician, and a pioneering spirit flew away from this world. I have no idea whether Robert Fripp was familiar with this effort, but Derek seems to have resolved many of the musical quandries, conundrums, dead ends Fripp hit with the assorted ProjeKcts, post the double trio version of Crimson. And Bailey does them with something in the trunk. At times the rhythm section is as abstract as Bruford and Levin, at times as funky as Billy Cox and Mitch Mitchell, as frontier pushing as Ricky Wellman and Foley McCready. Certainly they are their own men, but in calling forth predecessors and colleagues, they reference a direction in music that had a hard time finding believers. You can believe in this effort. It is genius. So, if you want to enjoy your next experimental leap into what Music can say when the practitioners are not afraid to do what they do not know how to do, I can recommend no finer effort than Mirakle. It is aptly titled. And it makes the loss of Bailey all the more sorrowful.
