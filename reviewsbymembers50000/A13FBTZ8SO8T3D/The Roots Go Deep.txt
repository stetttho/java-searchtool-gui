 One of the best segments of Martin scorcese's overview of the history of the blues was his own film, which focused on Corey Harris taking it back to Mali and connecting with Ali Farka Toure. This CD was born out of that same mission, and as you would know if you have ever heard Mississippi Fred McDowell or Asie Payton, and THEN listened to Boubakar Traore, the ocean is a small creek over which the deeply emotional and soulful music has crossed. Harris takes up in more detail the part he played in Scorcese's account, and his incredible picking and sense of the rhythmic drive connecting both the American and African traditions is nothing short of dynamic and extraordinary. This is very compelling music, yet not a dry dissertation. The emotional payoff comes with Ali Farka Toure's track 13: Charlotte. It is as beautiful a moment as you'll ever hear in any music this year. Harris is a terrific bluesman and one would hope he continues his examination of this music to which he is so devoted. It comes from very deep in his soul and you can hear it sing clearly.
