 This is a masterpiece from the Tibetan singer, whose voice carries more pure unaffected spirituality and soul than any other singer in any other discipline in the world. For my meager punts, this is likely the best CD I'll hear this year, even if Huong Thanh releases a new CD. For those weaned on American radio, this is the voice that comes from that place primordial in your deepest heart of hearts. I can not imagine that anyone who listens to Lhamo will not come face to face with what moves them most profoundly. As to this specific release, the aesthetics espoused by Real World are all in place. Real World, like ECM or ACT, is known for its sound, regardless of the culture. Here you'll find a certain acoustic quality that generates a reverb and a space for the lower register of instruments and the rhytmic texture to flow, without flooding the voice, and it is the voice thattranscends the mix. Overall, the CD is dedicated to her mother, who sacrificed enormously to get Lhamo and her family out of Tibet and away from the Chinese oppression. The CD also expresses grief at the tragedy of 9/11, not just for those who lost loved ones, but for the state of the human soul that so much suffering was flash lit by those planes, that so much deception and lies and avarice have had free reign in the aftermath of the collapse. Joy Askew and Annie Lennox join in at different points to underscore the Tibetan plea for peace and forgiveness. Compassion requires both parties to bring an open heart to the crises.  You are not likely to find a more compelling album in the racks and bins by anyone this year. If you care about the quality of the human heart, this is a CD for the ages.
