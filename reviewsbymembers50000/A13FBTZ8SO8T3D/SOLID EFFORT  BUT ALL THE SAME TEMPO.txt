 Inspite of the carping about what CD this one doesn't sound like, the reality is that it is a very solid effort, and a more ruminative work than either their rock salad days or their treacly pop efforts. It is as though they were taking a moment to reflect on where they are right now. That sense of reflection leads the peripatetic efforts on a measured pace, and so there is a tendency by the 3/4 mark to feel that the melodies are certainly all the same tempo and in fact are starting to run together. That could torpedo most bands and CDs, but in the case of REM, the music is really quite good and I do find myself returning to this disc a lot and enjoying it immensely, although not on long drives at night. The cast of characters is basically the same, with Bill Rieflin and Scott McConneghy (sic) a more permanent presence. I suspect they are still at a bit of arms' length, though, and to my ears, that is what is holding REM back. The drum chair needs a permanent card carrying partner, as does the piano stool. Bringing these men into the creative partnership would help take the band in a direction it seems to need. Berry is gone and not coming back, so get on with it. The stuck in neutral issue is legitamate, but could certainly be resolved. Their live DVD proved all that. Still, this is a good CD and comes fully recommended. Even at 3 stars, REM is significantly more interesting than nearly everyone else out there.
