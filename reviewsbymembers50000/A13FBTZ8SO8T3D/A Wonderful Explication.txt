 With the passing recently (September, 2003) of Rabbi Dr Fackenheim, the world has lost a dedicated teacher. It was a great honour to study with Dr Fackenheim at Toronto in the seventies, and in particular, to consider the religious dimension in Hegel's thought with his guidance. This is a wonderful explication from which his lectures and reconsiderations evolved. If you have an avocation for Hegel, this is on a par with Hyppolite and Gadamer. The world of Philosophy lost a very dedicated teacher who understood his profession as a calling. He will remain an inspiration to all of us who were lucky to know him.
