 Not a really cohesive vision at work here, but you have to keep in mind that Young was endorsing Ronald Reagan at this period in his life. That Virginia cracker element in his heritage was never that far eneath the surface, and I suppose western Canada is not all that much different than the US MId West, South or West: rightwing is the only way to fly. Anyway, there is nothing particularly wrong with anything here, and both "Captain Kennedy" and "Southern Pacific" were pretty decent B level tunes for Young, and would hold up better in concert with stronger material surrounding them. Unfortunately, they carry the quality of this disc, and it is not a very strong disc. This is strictly for completists.
