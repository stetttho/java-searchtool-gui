 And such a thing should not exist! The opening 2 movements of "Alberich", referencing the nasty character in Wagner's RING, are positively superb, with an element of unresolved tension building throughout. It all comes undone in Glennie's solo. And that's what it is: a drum solo in the midst of a classical concerto. I'd have thought that that conceit had died along with the abysmal excesses of charaters like Rick Wakeman. This is right out of his "Journey to the Center of the Earth" and while I don't doubt for a minute that people in LA would stand and applaud (their two cultural contributions to Civilization being the right turn on red and Arnold as Governor), it struck me as completely ridiculous. In fact, I'm surprised Glennie would go for this. Someone must have slipped her a mickey in the haggis. She is a great rock drummer as far as that goes, though she might find more of a challenge working with Bill Bruford instead of this piece. "Rapture" is indeed  beautiful. It nearly resolves the CD. The Violin Concerto is Prokofiev influenced and executed well, but I tired of listening to it. Leif Segerstam and his crew are a daring orchestra that have produced great and powerful music. I'd recommend their take on Rautavarra's Symphony No. 8 in a heartbeat. The problem is the material here.
