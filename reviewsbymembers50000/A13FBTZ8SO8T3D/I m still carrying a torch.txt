 waiting for Van to reignite the mystic fire of the soul that seems to have gone retrograde since HYMNS TO THE SILENCE.  Can't figure out quite what happened, it's as though prolific songwriting instead of inspired craft seems to be his chosen path and mantra. Odd. What's wrong with this picture? Nothing. It's all brilliantly executed as he reworks his familiar paens to the music that influenced him when he was a tosser on the streets of Belfast. The horn charts and the undercurrents of R & B are absolutely perfect. Yet there is a soul missing that once dwelled on the threshold, cleaning windows, considering the garden wet with rain. The days of the avalon summers and the drives to Coney Island, with sunday papers and jamjars full of mussels seem to have faded from memory. There has been a spate of incessant carping about the slights Van suffers at the hands of the music industry men. Who cares? Deal with it and get back to writing songs from the soul. What happened to the Yeats of Northern Ireland? "Somerset" and "Too Many Myths" seem to recall what motivated Van once. The rest is all quite good musically, but lyrically leaves a lot, a whole lot out. It's all a bit like Wynton Marsalis: technically the best trumpet player out there, but with very little evidence of living inside the music with any notion of soul. Van has recalled note-perfectly the influebces that led him to his career. But at this point in time, mimicing perfectly seems just so unworthy of such a great writer.
