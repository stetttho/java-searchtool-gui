 One of the wolves great strengths is their ability to cover a tune and make it their own. Their usurpation of Neil Young's "Cinnamon Girl," "Down by the River" and "Cowgirl in the Sand" remain the definitive renditions of each of these tracks. Unfortunately, none of them made it onto this EP. There's no reason for this to be an EP. LL has generated so much incredible heat, that even on the heals of THE RIDE CD, in which they relegated themselves (unwisely) to back-up band status, a full CD of cover tunes from their career, live or studio, would have been just amazing. In any case, from the opening Waits number, through the live rendition of "Marie", the band is on fire. It reaches an emotional high point with Richard Thompson's "Shoot Out the Lights," again making this song their own, and nearly eclipsing the scorching versions RT has effected. Costello's "Uncomplicated" is so finely turned that I really had forgotten that the Liverpool troll had written it. Womack's "More Than I Can Stand" stands on a par with the very fine tracks that were the highlights of THE RIDE. This is a greater CD than THE RIDE. Less is more and that's a shame, as a little more would have been a whole lot of great music.
