 This is a terrific political film in the tradition of Costa Gavres and hits the bulls eye on so many evil doers in the Mid_east imbroglio that Gaghan had best hope Cheney takes a fatal no 7 before he gets the idea to settle the score. Extremely taught and brilliantly acted, this is a document as convulted as Traffic that makes it abundantly clear just how complicated and simple the story really is. It comes down to greed, and greed is there in spades from the US government to the US oil companies to the wealthy arab monarchies to the insurgents with a larger agenda. Through it all, lives are wasted. On both grand and intimate scale, the bad guys are custom building a whole new circle of hell. Your heart will race, especially as the inevitable conclusion bears down. Clooney is brilliant in this. So is Jeffrey Wright and the Arab actor who plays the "good" prince. The bad guys from Christopher Plummer on are just seething with evil. The only episode that is superfluous is Matt Damon's subplot. It's tear-jerker stuff, whose conclusion is the only improbability in the whole film. Costa Gavres would have left him on the editing floor. But, no matter. For Gaghan, this film is a triumph. Hope Hollywood has the huevos to honour it.
