 As John Hiatt CDs go, this one is a gem. The songs are classic and reenforce his well earned reputation. Tunes like:"How Bad's the Coffee?", "My Baby Blue", "Circle Back," and "My dog and Me" are all vintage, essential Hiatt songs, with that view of having been lived through that is so genuinely true about him.  The Goners are his natural compadres. As right for him as Crazy Horse is for Young. My only quibble with this CD is that Sonny Landreth is buried in the mix, and when you listen to his incendiary leads throughout this CD, that's just plain frustrating. Drums and bass are way too forward. Not one of the best mixing efforts on a Hiatt disc. Perhaps a remaster is in order, NOW.
