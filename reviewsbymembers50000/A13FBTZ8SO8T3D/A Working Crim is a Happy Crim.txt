 Lord knows what the next Crimson album will be like but on the basis of the two EP-CDs, LEVEL FIVE anad HAPPY ETC, it's absolutely pointless trying to imagine, so let's look at this one, quite a different sort of greeting card altogether! A mix of all sorts of surprises, this disc includes some fetchingly belewbewildering haiku, which although delivered a bit monochromatically, suggest that the intrepid lyricist is up to his own extraordinary standards and surprises. With each passing disc, and maybe as a result of the current CGT + 2 cd, Pat Mastellotto's percussive identity take son more and more personality and his directions in music seem to have more confidence. Certainly on this disc, he is a wonder with the rhythmic leaps of Trey Gunn. An lo and behold! For the first time in , well, I guess since "Poseidon", the King plays acoustically! And it is terrific! "Eyes Wide Open" is listed as an accoustic version of the song. I"m not sure I'd want it any other way. This is a great piece of music, and it sounds terrific in the hands of four masters. The disc ends with an electronic collage from Belew that features Uncle Bobby singing a few notes. Why did he ever bother with Gordon Haskell? Anyway, this one's a great deal of fun and we'll see what the Great Deceiver is up to, come spring time. For Crim fans, it has been a fantastic autumn!
