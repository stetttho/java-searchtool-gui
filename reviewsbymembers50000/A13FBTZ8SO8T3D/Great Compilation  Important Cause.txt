 This is a great survey of contemporary African artists in support of HIV/AIDS research and care for the African continent. It is the CD companion to the book of photojournalism all shot on a single day. This is a project beguan years ago by the Irish Cancer Society, and has moved on to other parts of the world. It is well worth supporting. The music is uniformly terrific, and holds together well as an entire disc. You'll find the well-known: Cesaria Evora, Habib Koite; as well as newer artists Gigi and the incredible Khadja Nin. The Soweto String Orchestra gets things off to a swinging start and the music percolates and sways with the familiar pointilist style of guitar playing one thinks of with South African music. Most of the continent is well represented.  This is a terrific primer if you are not familiar with African jazz and contemporary music, and a welcome collection to enjoy if you do know these artists. And since some of the proceeds will address a devastating epidemic, you can feel good about lending a hand as well as dancing your heart away.
