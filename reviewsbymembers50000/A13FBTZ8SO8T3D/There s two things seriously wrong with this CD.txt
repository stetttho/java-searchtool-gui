 1.: Ashley sings 2.: Ashley doesn't play the fiddle  That's egregious on both counts, particulalrly when the material has as its subject matter, A's homosexual shenanigns, and the material is lame to boot. His bravado is certainly not the x-rated mysoginy of everyone in rap and hip-hop, but it still is something no one really has been waiting to hear. I'm not sure why the gay community in general feels the need for another Freddie Mercury, but Ashley, on the strength of this release, is definitely off the list. Categorically in need of a better lyricist, a better tunesmith, and a better manager to remind him to stick to the fiddle, bi-polar Ashley continues to woo and alienate anyone who'd really like to see him become recognized for the prodigious amount of talent he has. His recent LIVE AT THE SAVOY is one of the finest and purest traditional Cape Breton releases you'll ever hear. There was a time with HOW ARE YOU TODAY where Ashley seemed in command of the bridge that made crossing into rock from a Scots-Cape Breton tradition an exciting place to be. He has recoiled from that in the course of his rock-oriented efforts, and more's the pity. It just isn't very good, regardless of the sexual politics. Even if the decision is made to torpedo a career with material like this, he ought to hire someone who can sing it. Flat and un-tuneful is a sad monker for one of the best fiddle players ever. Avoid this. It's worse than Johnny Cunningham's Raindogs.
