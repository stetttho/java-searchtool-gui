 a lot better than the dopey description from Sony. Runga has turned a corner in her songwriting - she comes to the table here with sophisticated songs about romance, break up, regret, hope that are mature, intelligent, and altogether something that would make you think of the Elvis Costello-Burt Bachrach collaboration. She is helped in no small measure by having Neil Finn, the southern Hemisphere's Paul McCartney, on board to lead the band, weave intricate and often heartbreaking harmony, and apply a certian Crowded House accent to Runga's impressive arrangements. I'm not sure what the point of describing the recording space is, because Runga puts a lot of stock in the ambient quality of her music, live or studio. And don't get me wrong she's not some Kiwi Enya or Loreena McKennit or, perish the thought, Tori Amos. Instead, you have one of this planet's most intelligent writers delivering a group of songs thematically symbolized by the tranistory life of birds. Maybe not since Poe, or Mary Oliver, has someone really got it how that analogy seems to resonate for us trapped on the ground. In any case, there's a lot more at play than there ever used to be in Bic's recordings. My guess is that the live CD with Dave Dobbin and Tim Finn had a lot to do with this shift in gravitas. What used to be filed under "guilty pleasure" is a lot more required listening these days. Maybe it's just the timing. Having just seen someone I love fly away.....
