 What a great CD this is, as faithfully and as beautifully recorded with an absolutely perfect balance among the instruments, voices and dynamics! For the uninitiated, Habib Koite is one of the most original guitarists to have emerged in the last few years. His finger picking is extraordinarily lyrical and his original songs are among the most captivating you'll ever hear in any discipline. An incredible musician and writer, an expressive singer and an absolutely enchanting performer, Koite has assembled a protean group of colleagues to bring his music to life in concert, and this document tracks him over a European tour playing to audiences who succumb totally to the wonders of theis Malian artist. I can think of few others who have burst upon the field of music with such grace and command of their art! If you are familiar with any of his CDs, you will exalt at this live set. Songs find new directions, as the improvisations evolve in turns and twists as mysterious as the Malian tradition of griot prophecy. As you listen to this set, you'll find yourself wishing you were there. Highlights include "Bitile" "Muso Ko", "Wassiye" and "Cigarette Abanna". But the whole concert is a marvel. If you have had it with the endless parade of hip hop pablum and the dulling monotony of almost all music out of Los Angeles or New York, turn your ears here. The record company hegemony ends on the shores of Mali, and you'll find yourself connecting with a trance-like tradition that came to America and became the fertile delta of jazz, blues and rock. This is not college radio world music. This IS MUSIC itself of the highest order and deepest passion. FOLY is the front runner for the best CD of 2004!
