 Let's be clear, Sinead O Connor has the most power voice in rock music, bar no one, no body, not any of the belly-buttoned poseurs, long haired shrews and charlatans, right-thinking nicknamed emissaries, nobody can take over a song like Sinead. This woman has more soul than absolutely everyone in R & B, rap, hip-hop and whatever else rolled together, save Aretha, Ray or James. Period. Everyone else is faking it. Having said that, this is the Sinead record you can play for your granny. She does her signature turn on what are otherwise oversung songs, and breathes new life into them. She has brought in Donal Lunny and his cast of brilliant sidemen ( you get the feeling that perhaps it might be interesting to hear an Irish record without them), duets with like-minded Christy Moore, the Tempest in a Tshirthimself whispering in co-conspiratory fashion with Sinead, and acquits herself with sheer brilliance on her two Gaelic numbers, Iontach Mhaith! However, underneath the surface of this idyll, one wonders if there isn't a lion about to roar, and a cobra about to strike. My 11 year old niece thought there was something just beneath the surface here that sought release. Hmmm. Brilliant succeses with Afro-Celt, flaming disasters with Gabriel, intrepid cameos with the Chieftains and Van, and a mix of children, ambivalences and spiritual gyres and perhaps Sinead is stilling the waters of her soul in order to live and sing again with a clearer and even fiercer life for all of this. Let's hope so. The world stage needs to be wiped clean of the fakeurs. Shhhh............Listen,............is that the sound of a rattle?
