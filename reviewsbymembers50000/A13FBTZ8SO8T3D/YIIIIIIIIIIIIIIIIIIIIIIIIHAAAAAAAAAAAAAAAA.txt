 Whenever I am asked why I believe the Canadian government should seal the 49th parallel, I point to the foaming mouth, bug-eyed performance of this white peach from Georgia during the Republican Putsch in NYC in 2004. While it was positively riveting television, it was also as blunt an assessment of where this whole neo-conservative fascism fuels its deepest resentments, and how hypocritical are the people who govern in the name of what was once a decent country. The idea that you would not goosestep in formation with a Christian fueled fanaticism is as repellent to this reb as Sherman's March through Georgia. Pity George didn't finish the job. Anyway, I got a real hoot out of this book. It is like a cracker's version of Mein Kampf. That Miller would presume to lecture one and all about decency while simultaneously spewing a resentment of dissent should tell you what you need to know about the mind set of those who ignore the environmental, political, ethical, and financial consequences of the havoc they wreak on a planet that they firmly believe God gave them the moral imperative to destroy. And really what is this but a way of burning a neo-con cross on the front yard of those you'd like to intimidate?  So give Goober props for telling it like it is, even if what it is ain't what he reckons. I remeber a friend of mine from Chicago who used to say that he loved George Wallace 'cause you knew exactly where you stood. Same principle, different fanatic. All in all, the only decent thing for others on the North American shelf to do is seal the borders until folks like this choke on their own methane.
