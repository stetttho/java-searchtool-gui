 Uncle Tupelo was a thing of beauty. They had the spook, they had the root, they had the rhythm and the mystery, and the train they drove chugged through the heartland. It had been 15 or so years since The Band called it quits, and in that yawning cavern of real music no one had stepped in to fill so aching a need. Not until UT, and though they would also soon split and come up with 2 or 3 really great spin offs, here before the big bang, it was an incredible universe. The disc opens with "Slate" and winds up with "Susie Q", and for the 70 minute ride in between, you're gonna hear nothing but terrific music. The Band tapped into what affected people. UT hit that same raw nerve. This is real honest stuff, with compelling, memorable melodies. Homage is paid to Acuff-Rose, as well as to the best elements of Neil Young (before he lost his direction), Levon Helm, Richard Manuel, Eric Anderson. The title track is extraordinary. "Give Me Back the Keys to My Heart" is possibly the best song written in the 90's.  Just as The Band appeared as completely against the trend of their times, UT also appeared as completely out of step with what was going on in music as it is possible to be. What they left behind, and this collection is their Supernova, is timeless. Once again, Rhino has done American roots music an extraordinary service in releasing this remarkable disc.
