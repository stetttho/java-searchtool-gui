 I'm not really sure what the point of this collection is, especially since SAND IN THE VASELINE covers the same and a bit more ground, and the more important double live CD THE NAME OF THE BAND IS TALKING HEADS  remains unreleased. Regardless, there are music videos included here. Yawn. and there is a bit of remastering, which sparkles everything up a notch. Why else you might want to pick this up, I couldn't really say. If you liked the Heads, this adds nothing but the MTV side of the story to your collection. If you don't like them, this won't convince you. If you're curious, yeah, why not, I suppose. But having done SAND, what's the point? oh, I forgot: money, especially when your solo careers have laid eggs. rotten sulfurous eggs...
