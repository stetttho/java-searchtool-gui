 I'm not sure I can articulate why I like this CD, but I do find that it has that Eno-like quality of being seductively ambient, whatever that means. Essentially, Air is well named: not a lot of substance, but certainly important. The French duo have constructed a disc that will impress you intellectually and cast a spell over you in a near dream-like trance. It is absolutely a romance cd, and so the perfect soundscape for a very intimate dinner come Valentine's.  Standing out from the batch are certainly the opening track, "Venus" and the follow up "Cherry Blossom Girl," which completely mesmerizes me. Oddly, the track "Tokyo" is the least convincing on the whole CD, and in my case that's due largely to what a bore I thought "Translation" was as a movie (an extended Bill Murray joke that doesn't know when to end). Accompanying the CD is a DVD of Air in concert, along with a series of docu-video stuff. Musicians, unless they are Miles or Trane, should be heard and not spoken to, Air is no exception. The live footage though is interesting. File this under guilty pleasures, to the popside of Eno.
