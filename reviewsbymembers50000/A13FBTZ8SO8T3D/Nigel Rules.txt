 This is terrific, top to bottom! I can write for hours about the joys of Nigel live, the visual and musical daring, the goose in the arse of most orchestral experiences and the rapturous, clamourous, rock and roll reaction he elicits in the most staid of settings. Classical music was not ready and remains uncertain how to deal with him, mostly because he has the chops and the creativity first and foremost. This collection underscores his remarkable repertoire. Be it Vivaldi, Beethoven, Kreisler, Elgar or Hendrix, Kennedy upends the expectations of one and all. His intensity is extraordinary, his playfulnesss on stage a joy, his interpretive skills incisive.  At this point, though, what would be even more welcome than this terrific collection, would be a DVD of the man himself in action. I can still hear the crowd at Philadelphia's Academy of Music howling, that's right, howling, for an encore. Sawalisch was not sure what to do. The Orchestra looked stymied. Out came Nigel with the fiddle attached to his forehead. He shouted at the audience that they were possibly further off their rockers than he and then asked if anyone in the orchestra knew any Willie Dixon. One of the double bassists did and they launched into "Gingerale Afternoon." Sheer genius, especially on the heels of Beethoven's volin concerto. Lu himself would have dug it immenseley.  Pick this disc up, then write to his label and insist on a DVD.
