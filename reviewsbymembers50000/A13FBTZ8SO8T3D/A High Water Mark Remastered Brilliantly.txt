 Make no mistake about it, if you were to own only one Bruce Cockburn CD in your life, it ought to be this one. The sophistication of the guitar work, the tunes themselves, the French and English lyrics presented Bruce on the cusp of a lot of transitions, and while he may have been dancing in the dragon's jaws, he also produced the most compellngly engaged music spiritually of his career. This is the moment of his big bang, and what a moment of creation it was, and still is.  The extra track adds to the ambience of the disc, but, frankly, it could have been left off anyway. The original sequence of songs is so strong, that any appendage is no more than that. The remastering is brilliant. It was a brilliant sounding album when it first came out and when it first made the transition to CD. It just keeps getting better. By all means, purchase this disc. I've worn out 4 vinyl versions and 2 other cds, so I can tell you you will return to this often throughout your life.
