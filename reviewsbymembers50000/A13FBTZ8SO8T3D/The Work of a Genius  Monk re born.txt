 Jazz is blessed with an incredible array of talent now, and it's a pity that the marketplace is so tuned in to the ephemeral. So many young lions and seasoned veterans are making the music of their careers that it is somehow culturally criminal that America, and most of the rest of the world, is stuck in navel gazing, be it Beyonce, Shania or whoever this year's model is. With regard to Jason Moran, you could make a strong, very strong , argument that jazz is presented with its most creative and philosophical thinker since Thelonius Monk. All of his CDs are genuinely satisfying to the soul, the mind, the spirit, and there's always something for the trunk as well. This current CD takes his extraordinary high standards of excellence up a notch. A huge notch! Recorded live at the Village Vanguard (a place that seems to pull genius out of artists), except for one taped and looped Turkish phone call, Moran and his mates deliver an unparalleled, exciting set. Visiting standards, original compositions, the mix of found sounds a la Holgar Czukay (remember "Persian Love Song" from MUSIC AND RHYTHM on RealWorld records from the early 80's?), Brahms, and Afrika Bambaata, it is an absolute wonder how he has re-considered, dwellt poetically, uncovered a ground of truth about Music itself in this brilliant display of the Buddhist sense of Interbeing. The interlocking grooves, polyrythms and dynamics will have you hitting replay loads of times. This is a CD that will be written about for generations, much like Evans, Coltrane and so many others who somehow found a path beyond themselves opening up in the live setting of the Vanguard. By all means purchase this, it is a work of wonder, and when is the last time you can say you were honestly wonder-struck by a recording?
