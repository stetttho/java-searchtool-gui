 When you listen to this and Jay Farrar's two recent live CDs the only thing I can think is that it's time for Tweedy and Farrar to get back together. They are more kindred spirits now in their separate releases than they have ever been, including ANODYNE.  A Ghost is born indeed: that of UT. It is all through the brilliant guitar treatments and haunting landscapes painted by Tweedy and Company, and frankly the exact same rings true of Farrar's 2 discs out now. Both men are firing on all burners and were you to cull 1 CD from these efforts it might well exceed the superlatives laid at the feet of any artist. If you only purchase this and not Farrar, or vice versa, you are not getting the full picture. Not since Stills' Columbia debut STILLS and Neil Young's ZUMA have two artists been separately more like brothers. UT was Buffalo Springfield. Tweedy and Farrar however have kept their artistic integrity and focus far more intact than Stephen and Shakey. In any case, GHOST IS POSITIVELY TERRIFIC. Much has been made about it telling the story of a breakup, but you know what, it doesn't matter. The music is great, and all the songs stand on their own and the band is exteremely creative in taking things through many textures and changes. Outstanding!
