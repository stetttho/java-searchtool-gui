 I'm not sure Steve Winwood is all that engaging live. Having seen him with Traffic, solo, and on the tour this was part of, his music certainly speaks for itself, and he's content to leave it at that. Thus TRAFFIC JAM  was a huge surprise in how brilliantly enlivened the performances were. This show for Soundstage lacks a certain oomph. Mind you, it's brilliantly executed and shot in hi-def, so you can actually hear the beads of sweat roll down his forehead, but for all that, it isn't quite an engaging document, which may accoiunt for the number of delays in its release. It's almost video wallpaper. The picture is irrelevant as the music carries the day. I'm glad I have it, but I can tell you that his show at The Tower, a real cesspool of a venue, was as powerful an evening of music and certainly an invocation of the Traffic muse, as I have ever heard. This Soundstage gig is way too sterile.
