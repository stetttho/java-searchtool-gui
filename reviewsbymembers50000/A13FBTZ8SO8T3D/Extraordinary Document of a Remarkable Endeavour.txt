 King Crimson has always cast away the safety net when performing live and this remarkable double CD documents 2 high wire explorations of the double trio. Although from different shows in different countries at two very different times in the course of this endeavour, what remains consistent is that dramatic leap for the bar in mid air. Fripp claims collisions occur, but like Miles Davis and John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman, all of whom explored the double and triple helixes of recombinant rhythm sections, the collisions are as thrilling as the successes. As an enthusiast of the double trio, I often found myself perplexed by what they were after, but make no mistake, they were in hot pursuit of that which Music had revealed in confidence to them. Whether reinvestigating "21st Century Schizoid Man," revving up through "Vroom", repainting "Red" or essaying the achingly beautiful "One Life", Crim at this point sought a turning of the facets for another revelation. Both shows are fascinating, fun, inspiring. Humour is never far from the Court and Belew's take on Lennon's Beatleless version of "Free As A Bird" evokes a wry chuckle both for those who thought he missed a lyric and for those who realize that their counterparts missed a missed lyric. Soundscapes accompany the entrance of the "Biker Babes from the Rio Grande", and "B'Boom" shakes the foundations fundamentally of whatever you think KC might be about. "Two Sticks" swirl in mid air as though twirling through a Stanley Kubrick film, and the post gamelan interplay between Fripp and Belew is positively breathtaking.  DGM deserves a hearty and robust thank you for releasing this document. I hope that one day the double trio will reconvene. Having seen them twice and listened to the various documents of their time together, it seems there is musicking still in the garden, so perhaps in time..... Looking back, for the moment, the likes of ye may never come again, buy jayziz, ye were brilliant........
