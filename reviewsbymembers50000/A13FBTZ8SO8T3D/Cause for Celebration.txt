 Any new release from Sonny Landreth is a cause for celebration. Certainly one of the greatest slide guitarists ever and a brilliant writer, Landreth has again come up with a sinewy workout of his remarkable technique in the service of compelling and plaintive cajun blues. Every song is a gem. His voice is as languid as a summer day on the Mississippi delta, and in his inflections you hear the crossroads of Acadian culture and black rural blues. His is a voice of wonder. The musicianship throughout is terrific. Steve Conn's organ fills out a palette coloured by remarkable rhythm work from Dave Ranson, Mike Burch and Brian Brignac. The recording is warm and intimate and the mix is superb. Everything technically as well as artistically about this disc is first rate. Enjoy this disc! Along with Chris Smither and James McMurtry, Sonny Landreth is the real deal. And he has come up with a real treasure!
