 Christian McBride and Roy Hragrove are determined to prove that jazz can be fun, funky, uplifting, a shout for joy! And on this 3 disc set, McBride and Co deliver the goods. Exhorting the crowd to make some noise, the pre-eminent bass player in jazz turns in a workout that would raise the dead and make them holler. Less compositional, and far mor jam-band and improvisational, his team takes flight on each number as though this will be their last session on earth. The crowd definitely responds enthusiastically, and it will be weeks before you can wipe that smile off your face. Guest artists include the incomparable Jason Moran and Charlie Hunter, but even the core group is altogether ready and willing to throw caution to the wind. That the whole project comes off so successfully is what makes Music itself such a gift, an ineffable positive force in life, without which we'd be so entirely diminished. By all means, pick this up. In fact send one to Wynton Marsalis. He could use the lift.
