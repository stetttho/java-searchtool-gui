 Los Lobos rebounded from the cover band status of THE RIDE with the DVD of this concert a couple of months back. Critics wailed why they hadn't done a live CD or DVD before. Well, amen, especially if you have ever caught any of their shows. It's actually a pity that this is the only such document, because while it is certainly a great performance, it is only a taste of the magic they command. I may go to a million more concerts before I hear a band essay Neil Young's "Cowgirl in the Sand" the way these wolves knocked it out at the Philly Folk Festival while Gene Shay swallowed his tongue because the boys simply would not end the song and get off so he could prattle his stupid stories and jokes. For that alone, they became my heroes. Point is, even Young, on his very best day, never delivered that song with the incendiary fire of Los Lobos. But I digress, and this is a worthy addition to their incredible canon. The only foul ball for me is "The Viking," but that's quibbling, because they more than make up for it with the mini CD of 3 acoustic songs, and I won't tell you what they are, but one was such a delightful surprise! So, I'd tell you to pick this up. Hidalgo, Peres and compadres have never, or actaully ALWAYS, sound this good live. So where's the box set? This is a band you should rush to go see and if they do release a box, swamp AMAZON with orders for it. How will the Wolf survive? Well, with performances like these, should be easy.
