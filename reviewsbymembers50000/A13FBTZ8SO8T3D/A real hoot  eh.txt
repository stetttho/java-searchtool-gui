 There's a certain part of me that would like to see Quebec secede from the Confederation just so Celine Dion and Michael Buble and even Anka would have to go away for a while until they got new visas, yet there is a real funny aspect to this release. It seems as though Anka saw Bill Murray's bits as the lounge lizard doing rock songs and thought it was a great idea. What you have here then is an hilarious project inspite of the intentions. Hopefully, Anka cut Murray in on the royalties. If you are old enough to remember Frank Sinatra tackling (and that image is appropriate) some of McCartney's ballads, you'll understand the initial cringe factor that this project would inspire. But if you can get over that, then you'll also find a parody inspite of itself. Imagine BEST IN SHOW being a serious attempt at documentary and you've got it. I howl every time I listen to this CD, which thankfully I didn't purchase. It's a hoot.
