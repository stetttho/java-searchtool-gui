 This was the swan song, a final farewell for the group that had taken the Celtic Revival sparked by Christy Moore and blew it into an uncompromising Firestorm that swept all before it. The incendiary virtuosity of Johnny and Phil Cunningham, the protean songwriting and mellifluous voice of Andy M. Stewart, the rock solid rhythm fretwork of Martin Haden and Gordon Jones were unparalleled at the time and set the bar so high that only Altan has ever surpassed them. And the case can well be made that there would be no Altan without Silly Wizard. This December, founding member Johnny Cunningham passed away, and thus an incredible part of Scots culture has left us. You must remember that this band was formed by Cunningham in 1972 when he was 14 and Phil was 12. every significant Scottish musicians in the 80"s and 90's was impacted by Silly Wizard. Most of the really important ones were either briefly associated or absolutely inspred by SW's accomplishments. As you can tell from the customer reviews, all of the CDs were sterling efforts. This one though has all the bittersweet elements of a fond farewell. Like The Beatles, there had been a feeling that they had covered the waterfront and it was time to move on. A tour was launched and perhaps the best playing of their career was delivered. The humour on stage was more accurately captured on the Green Linnet video, but this is a remarkable document of a band who quit at the peak and left all of us forever wanting more.  If you have nay Scots blood in you at all, you will find yourself full of pride in these remarkable men. If you have an avocation for this music, it simply does not get any better at all. 5 stars is somehow far short of just how incredible this disc is.
