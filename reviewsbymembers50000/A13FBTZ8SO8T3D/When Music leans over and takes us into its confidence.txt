 ... these words of Robert Fripp come to full fruition in this recording that flexes a sublime and intelligent becoming at one with the music by Barenboim and his courageous disciples. The project is wonderfully filmed with exquisite sound on the DVD as well. And that all goes to drive home the point that when passions are reserved for music instead of politics, beware! Peace will break out.  Kudos as well to Barenboim who recently snubbed an Israeli reporter for trying to interview him while she was in uniform. It certainly took chutzpah and courage to call the fascist canard for what it was. Barenboim is no stranger to refusing to cowtow to an intractable mindset, and on the heels of this release it affirms the philosophical point that peace does not exist in a vacuum, and therefore you can not create beauty amid the trappings of war. There is a lesson here for the Americans as well, but it's not likely to be heard over the din of a country-western Nero fiddling stupidly with the future of the planet. In any case, if you care about classical music or if you just care about Israelis and Arabs finding a way out of the mess, this is required listening. An essential disc by any standard.
