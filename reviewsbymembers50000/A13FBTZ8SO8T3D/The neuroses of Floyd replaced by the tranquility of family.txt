 There's a thousand reasons why Gilmour would not want to re-enter hell with Roger Waters, first among them being the primal need for a better bass player and less o/c lyric writer. What's on offer with this brilliant solo exercise is a seasoned and subtle appreciation for the tranquility of family. It's a rare man that gets what solace can be found in the company of one's own, and in the songs on evidence here, Gilmour has found just such solace and a terribly nuanced and sophisticated appreciation for the peace therein. His soaring guitar runs scorch as ever across the musical landscapes. There is perhaps no more singular sustain than Gilmour's, save Santana and Fripp, and it is put to extraordinarily compelling dramatic effect in the delivery of these songs. The CD opens with an orchestral track arranged by no less a composer and conductor than Zbiegniew Preisner, whose homage to his friend Krysztof Kieslowski, and whose film Bleu he scored, remain among the finest orchestral works of the late 20th Century. Though brief, it is a riveting introduction. David Crosby and Graham Nash lend their soaring harmonies to the title track, perhaps advising Stills and Young that they still have a few of their own surprises left to pull. Throughout, in both his singing style, the thematic content and the orchestration of the songs, Gilmour also evidences the benefits of working with and having as a friend Paul McCartney. In short, this is a great leap beyond his previous solo work and the neurotic obsessions of Roger Waters that needed, and judging by CA IRA still need, placating. Whether Gilmour tours this stuff or not, hopefully he will pick up the pen and continue to write. All of us of a certain age who have gotten past the greasy kid stuff welcome a writer who can speak in a sophisticated musical and lyrical language to the concerns of our years, without the conceit of someone like Elvis Costello. This is just such a record.
