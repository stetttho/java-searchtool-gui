 but that aint saying much. Comparisons to BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE . are apt: this sounds a lot like left overs. And that's not entirely bad. The Cd has the same relentless attack on the ears, and he warbles on way too long, determined as ever to out bore Dylan. Yet the second half od the disc really is compelling. The Impostors, like the Attractions, bring out Mac Manus's more accessible tendencies, which is a good thing for all of us. This is not the snooze-fest of NORTH, nor the pretentious prattle of his Deutsche Gramaphone releases, and it almost sounds, at times, like the guy who used to write all those great songs. In any case, if you are a completist, pick it up. For the rest of you, if you have B & C, you already have this one as well.
