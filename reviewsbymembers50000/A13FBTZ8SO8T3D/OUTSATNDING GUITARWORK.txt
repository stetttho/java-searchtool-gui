 Along with Goren Sollscher's ELEVEN STRING BAROQUE,  this CD is just an amzing testament to an incredible guitarist, one you're not likely to hear as incredibly presented as this any time soon. Sollscher takes remarkable leaps with his dynamic 11 string work. Listening to King on this CD, I thought she could give the Viking a run for his money with just the 6 she plucks, strums, hammers and bends.  Having siad that, this is not the heavy mental stuff essayed by Michael Hedges, but more in touch with the melodic spirit embraced by middle period Bruce Cockburn or Leo Kottke. There is a sense of song about every track. There is precious little adornment and effects. None are needed. She is her own woman and she holds down the center brilliantly, while leaping in extraordinary directions. Imagine Bill Bruford playing guitar. If you have an avocation for the six string, pick this up. This woman is going places. Ezra Mohawk finally has a worthy successor.
