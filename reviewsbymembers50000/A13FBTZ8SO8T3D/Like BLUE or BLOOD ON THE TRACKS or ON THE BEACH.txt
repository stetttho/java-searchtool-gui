 this is Emmylou Harris' finest moment. I'm still not sure how to write about this disc. i could tell you that the songwriting is the most powerful songwriting I've heard in years. I could tell you that the McGarrigle Sisters, Malcolm Burn and Daniel Lanois are just some of the collaborators on this masterpiece. I could tell you that it follows in the tradition of her past several CDs, all of which have presented songs with such a haunting intensity that they live for a very long time inside you. Yet all of that prattle falls well below the mark. This does not have a country sound to it at all. This is from the Northern woods (Kingston, NY, to be precise) and perhaps because of its proximity to the Adirondak and Canadian forest lines, there is an aging wisdom, heartbreak, soul searching quality that gets inside you. There is a spirituality one finds only deep in the woods. Harris breathes it in this collection of devastating takes on the course of one's life. There is not a misplaced note or phrase through the course of this profound collection of "pensees". This is the stuff of Blaise Pascal, Hannah Arrendt. No one short of Bruce Cockburn comes even close to cutting to the core of the human condition. Yet, all these words fail to tell you what an extraordinary experience you will undergo when you listen to her music...... it will be a very long time before I have this all sorted out....
