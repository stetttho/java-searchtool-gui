 "Gates of Delerium", excluding "Soon", was a bit of a retread of the third movement of TALES, but it introduced Patrick Moraz briefly to YES fans. Moraz would make no one forget, and most people long for, Rick Wakeman, an unenviably position to be in, yet he had his moments, all of which came on what was the album's second side. Moraz's jazz influenced directions were best put to use with "Sound Chaser," an avant piece that opened YES up to more radical Twentieth Century classical directions than ther romantic-Wagnerian past had embraced. "To Be Over" sounded at the time like the swan song. It remains today one of the best songs YES has ever done. Howe recreated it with stunning poignancy on his NATURAL TIMBRES CD, and it is still the raison d'etre for this release. The tours for this CD convinced Moraz to look elsewhere for employment, which he did more successfully with The Moody Blues, and with a jazz duet with Bruford (wonder how Anderson and Fripp received that, hmmmmm.....). As to the remaster, jeez o man, it's incredible!  The extra stuff doesn't help the CD one way or the other, except that the single edit of "Soon" gets you past the disjointed bombast of most of "Gates." Not nearly as bad a release as DRAMA or YES from the 90's, but still, Yes was clearly in transition, with the very real prospect that it was all over. You can hear that worry throughout this release.
