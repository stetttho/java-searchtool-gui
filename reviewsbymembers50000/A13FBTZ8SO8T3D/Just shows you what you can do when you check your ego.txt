 I thought Stills was effecting the whiskey voice when I first heard this disc, but in fact, his voice was near shot. Funny, Dylan would come to later ape this vocal delivery at the close of the twentieth century.  Anyway, there are moments of genius here that you wish Stills would take note of and perhaps fashion as a career direction. His take on "Bluebird," and "Blind Fiddler" are genius. His composition "Treetop Flyer" a thing of wonder. The whole disc comes off all the better for his keepin it simple, acoustic and sublime. He seemed to be competing with no one, and as a result, he simply articulates poetry. The guitar playing is memorable, and often a testament to how protean he could be when he was not trying. If you are a fan of acoustic music in any respect, this is a worthy addition to your collection. Shame he couldn't exorcise the raging ego for good.........
