 This was an exceptional CD on its initial release and in DTS, it is positively, jaw dropping amazing. Give Steve Wilson credit for writing songs with a sense of dynamics unparalleled among his peers. The conclusion of this DVD-DTS is the most achingly beautiful conclusion to an album since the final 3 minutes of Yes' TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS. The separation of the musical instruments, the sheer surge and emotional force of the use of silence as well as power, the deft touch of the musicians themselves and the material make this in regular CD format a phenomenal record. In this extended definition version, it simply goes beyond description.
