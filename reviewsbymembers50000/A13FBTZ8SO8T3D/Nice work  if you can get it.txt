 Yeah, the music fits the film like a glove, and so I guess it succeeds on that level. But, really, this is Neil Noodling for 60 minutes while a film about nothing essentially rolls on to the end.  Imagine Jean Georges Vongerichten making potato latkes in Detroit. What a waste. Nothing else to say about it really. Nice job scoring a paycheck for this. "Philadelphia" it aint.
