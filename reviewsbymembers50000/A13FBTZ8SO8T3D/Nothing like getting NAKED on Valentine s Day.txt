 ... and that will be the last cute joke. I wasn't interested in getting the BRICK collection as I'm not all that thrilled with TRUE STORIES and the first two CDs, so opting for a more selective approach, the main motivation for purchasing this disc again was just how truly wonderful "Mr Jones" and "Nothing But Flowers" sounds - marvellous! If you're going to fizzle out as a band, then leave a calling card like this - it isn't their best, but they were still taking chances that none of their contemporaries had even considered, still haven't. The disc is still a landmark integration of African pop and the quirky brand of TH tunes that seem to call for the angular rhythms and percolating beats of the African musicians on board for these sessions. And they sound so sublime in these remastered and 5.1 renditions. After this, of course, Byrne would launch his Luaka Bop label and begin his full fledged advancement of south american and afro-carribbean music. Here at the beginning, though, it is a wonderfully rich and flavourful experiment that leaped over what the European contemporaries of TH were just beginning to expand. The weakest tracks are the most american-influenced. Anyway, this is absolutely worth the asking price.
