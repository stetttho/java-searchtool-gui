 This double disc is everything that was right about CSNY and everything that was wrong. In fact, what this demonstartes beyond a show of a doubt is that the creative effort here was driven by Crosby and Young. Nash played the part of Crosby's buddy, and played it better than anyone could imagine, especially given what was to come in their relationship. Stills and Young were locked in a control battle: 2 egos who could never find a way to work with each other without pissin on each other and anyone else within range. Stills is over the top all the way through this CD and when I listen back I am embarrassed for him. What a pompous jerk he is. And his own negative cult of personality would hereafter get firmly in the way of his writing skills. Young was extraordinarily spooky at this point in his career. He knew and exploited the fact that he was the edge for these guys. And he exploits it with extremely black humour and devastating pathos in his acoustic numbers. By the time things get electric, he was provoking Stills and playing him like a child with Spartan electric statements that Stills would answer with tedious elongated and uninspired jams. Crosby was the msytic in all of this. Be it happy hedonist or solitary stargazer, Crosby was in a very different spiritual place than his mates, and his msuic, his lyrics and his approach to life and love set him apart from the ego fracass. So, in reality, the acoustic set here is the keeper, the electric set a mess, except Cros's wonderful "Wooden Ships." This was an essentail LIVE document way back when. The acoustic stuff still is.
