 Scorsese's best film was LAST TEMPTATION, and nearly everything else that doesn't have Robert DeNiro in it stinks. THis is so dull, only someone from Bryn Mawr would applaud it. Speaking of which, Blanchett's portrayal of Hepburn is cliched. She wears pants, she smokes, she plays golf, her family is brahmin (sounds like every girl that ever went to Bryn Mawr), but there's no insight into what Kate was like. That's not necessarily Blanchett's fault as apparently Hepburn in her autobiography had no insight either. Di Caprio is another stuffed shirt. He couldn't act his way out of a grade school chorus. He kinda looks like Hughes, but he is as convincing as nothing more than someone who got the haircut right and some of the twitches down. It's hard to believe this film was nominated for anything other than the dust bin. The dialogue is pedantic at times, preposterous at others, and has enough gee-whiz in it to make it sound like a bad Mickey Rooney film. Looks nice though. I fell asleep three times trying to get through it. Maybe it's just that it's hard for the rest of us to emotionally invest in the life of HH. Like were they tro make a film about Gates, 1. would anybody care; 2. how good could it ever hope to be? Same problem here. Maybe if they had Depp play Hughes and DiCaprio play Willie Wonka, both films might come out better. But to suggest that DiCaprio be considered a best actor in the same breath as Freeman or Eastwood is the kind of blasphemy that JC himself would find an irresistable temptation to condemn. I couldn't possibly comment on the extras, as I've thrown the movie away.
