 If you share an avocation for jazz that sounds as fresh today as it did 40+ years ago, do your self an enormous favour and pick up this CD/DVD. It is a wonder from every standpoint. Monk was ever and always his own man, and his son's comments throughout the booklet are absoultely the best way to describe how his father's work crept up on you, got inside you and set you on flights of wonder. Both concerts featured here showcase his quartet of the sixties, especially Charlie Rouse, and the dynamics of the sound are really terrific. An earlier review quibble about the bass, but I would suggest the reviewer has grown too accustomed to Christian McBride. Larry Gales is from the era of Ron Carter, Paul Chambers, Jimmy Garrison, and he is quite clearly heard throughout. The DVD is from a Norwegian telecast. It's in black and white with pristinely restored sound and is a thing of beauty. You will find yourself still amazed at how Monk thought of and assembled the dramatic and often whiplash turns that he executed on teh keyboard, and somehow witnessing him do it doesn't make it any clearer. All in all, kudos to T.S. Monk. He has done a great think for his father's legacy, and as the years roll on,  it will become clear that Monk's impact on jazz, improvisational music, classical 20th century composition, and rock (you can make the argument that Hendrix was the Monk of the electric guitar) was nothing short of earth shattering.
