 If you are a Gabriel fan, there is much to celebrate here, including a new tune that's a decent cast off for Gabriel. If you have wandered into Gabriel recently, this set will illuminate for you what a powerful writer he is on his best days, how intenseley and with no quarter asked or given, continues to attach the electrodes to the fragile primate inside us all and flip on the juice. Of course, and particularly with his middle period, it is tough to listen to these songs out of context. There was always something of a psychological milieu into which his songs were set, and so when you listen to this double hits set, you'll find yourself recalling what preceeded or followed songs from 3, SECURITY, SO. Personally, I wish he had included "Mother of Violence" from the otherwise shrill and forgettable 2 and "And So It Begins..." from THE LAST TEMPTATION soundtrack, but these are minor quibbles. Essentially this compilation gave Gabriel the opportunity to remaster what had always been, except for 2, remarkable recordings when they were initially released, and the new clean remasters are wonderful. What also emerges inadvertently from listening to this set is that there was at least 1 truly great album that could have been culled from OVO and UP. Again, merely speculatively interesting. Somewhere along the way, there is a live box set worth assembling of Gabriel's perfomances, perhaps a live DVD set, because it has always been the case with him that the records have paled in comparison to their live delivery, and his imagination seems to just expand exponentially when given a stage from which to launch his ideas, beginning with the winged mythology of "Watcher" through the NZ Spherically inclined child growing up. I'm sure it would be a hit.
