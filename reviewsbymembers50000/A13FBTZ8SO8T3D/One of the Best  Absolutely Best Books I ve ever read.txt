 This book will live with you forever. My interest in this came from a Viet Namese friend who emigrated here with her family in the 90's. Thuy suggestion to read this book intrigued me, and from the first pages I understood thoroughly what she meant by the urgency in her suggestion. This is a tale of a family desperate to leave the oppression and disillusionment that followed the North Viet Namese victory in the long struggle to be free from outside colonists. What ensued was a nightmare of epic proportions. It is only now that Saigon's influence is returning to open the country up to the possibility of getting on with life in any kind of hopeful manner. However, as this tale recounts, this is a nearly "Killing Fields" Viet Nam. The perils and tragedies that this family suffers in order to gain their freedom will break your heart, inspire you and challenge you to never believe any formal officially sanctioned version of history, no matter who writes it. There is a family drama at work here as well, and I will not give away the story. You'll find this book impossible to put down. Andrew also has a tremendous sense of humour, which saves and enlightens him as he makes the spiritual journey back to his homeland. My friend believes that this acurately captures the dialectic of being an expatriate, yet still emotionally connected to the land of one's heritage. Whatever your own background, if you have invested any time in uncovering the story of your family, you'll connect with this book immediately. I've purchased this book three times. The first copy has circled the globe once among friends, the second is making its way through my friends and relatives across Canada, and the third is staying with me. Positively, absolutely, this is one of the finest memoirs ever written. This is a classic in world literature. Not since Peter Mathiessen's "The Snow Leopard" have I read a book as profoundly moving as "Catfish and Mandela".
