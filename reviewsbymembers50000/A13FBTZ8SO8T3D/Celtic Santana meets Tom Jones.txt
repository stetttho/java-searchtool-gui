 This CD is all over the place, but so is Ivers. Her eclectic tastes and her Irish roots have sent her out as a one woman Celtic Diaspora. I'd say this CD reflects New York more than anything else. Spanish Harlem, African immigrants and the hustle and bustle of the pace of NY infuse this record with loads of energy. The focus is as ADD as NYers are anyway, so to me it seems telling of its origins. None the less, Ivers has the goods. She's mucked it up plenty with punk, tradition and the Vegas-y Riverdance, and still one is awed by her chops. This woman can cook with all the burners up. Riverdance was less what it was about in Ireland than a showcase for the formiddable dynamics of Eileen Ivers once it hit Radio City. Flatley was and has been clearly at a loss in looking to duplicate Ivers' relentless pursuit of reel magic with any sort of fiddlechic who kept her clothes on. So in this endeavour, you have a clearly irrepresible Ivers gettin jiggy with a mix of NY, Irish and Spanish and African musicians. Like all of her work, it is absolutely great craic. The oddest thing about this, and I'm still not sure how I really feel about it, is that the lead singer sounds like Tom Jones. A lot. It's not unusual maybe for Ivers to pull this one off, and it rarely teeters into the smarmy tidepool Jones loved to wallow in, but it still comes off as odd and jarring. I'm not sure I could tell you where Ivers is going with this. It isn't Afro-Celt. And perhaps that's how she likes it. Anyway, it is a great hoot to listen to.
