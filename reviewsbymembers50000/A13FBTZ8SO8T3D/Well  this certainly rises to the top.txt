 Cream never really worked: you had world beat (before there was world beat) polyrhythmic drummer Baker, jazz fusionist bass player Bruce, and rock and blues guitarist Clapton, and as this set demonstrates, Music was drawn and triplicated by these three. Somehow out of this fission, remarkable things happened that would at times foreshadow fusion, world beat, or recall the feral power of the blues.  The BBC deserves , again, great praise for dusting off these gems. The legendary excess Cream would demonstrate in later live shows was held firmly in check, and somehow in the vice grip of these constrictions, they said more with less. It is a credit to their protean musicianship. If you are a fan, or just plain curious about what Clapton sounded like before he turned into Perry Como, this is what all the fuss was about. Personally, I think Baker got a whole lot better once he skimmed the fat off and went solo, and Lord knows what happened to Bruce. He hooked up with a series of truly horrible lyric writers (Sinfield, Brown) and turned out some astonishingly naff projects, but here he is determined not to let Clapton have the upper hand and the conflict generated true heat. All in all, this tight set, interviews and all, is a lot more satisfying than any of their albums.
