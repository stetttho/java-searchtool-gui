 Iarla O Lionard and his posse are back with an Afro-Celt release that is full of the spooky mist and multi-rhythyms that have set them apart. From the opening soundwashes and acoustic guitars of "Cyberia", the tone is set for odd-metred grooves and Celtic majesty. This time around, Mayo born reed whiz Emer Mayock deftly handles the haunting uileann pipes. Mayock's solo releases are absolutely worth hunting down via Ceirnini Claddaigh, and she is a natural for this ensemble, quite willing to hold down the pure drop while simultaneously pushing it into new oceans. Drummers Moussa Sisoko and Johnny Kaisi lock in the many rhtyhms and time signatures of this entirely danceable CD. In fact, if you're not dancing, even in your seat, you need to have someone dial 911 quick.  There are a boat load of terrific session players including the incendiary Eileen Ivers and the mesmerizing Martin Hayes on fiddles. Screaming Orphans (you'll figure it out) appear on "Rise Above It". Be it African chant, flamenco guitar touches, programmed keyboards casting techno-ambient spells, the whole seed being planted here takes root deep in the soul. And this is SOUL music of the most delicious kind. Who knew metaphysics could get so jiggy with it? Imagine Columbkille and Senegal's best kora players, percussion Moorishly Spanish, slap bass and uileann pipes, fiddles scratching deep in the very veins that bring the blood back to your heart. This music locks in on you and never releases until the final washes of sound fade away on "Green." This disc and Ashley Mac Isaac's latest, just released in Canda, are CDs to inspire wonder and keep you dancing, like dervishes, enthralled with all the mysteries your imagination can conjure. By all means, pick this one up. It is their best release to date, and hunt down Mac Isaac, the Hendrix of Celtic music.
