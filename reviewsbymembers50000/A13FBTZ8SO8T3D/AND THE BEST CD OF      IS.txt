 Sonny Landreth's GRANT STREET. There is everything to love about this record. The music is hot, slinky and sublime. The musicianship is absolutely brilliant. The vibe of this concert is especially infectious. I'd go so far as to say that if you were going to buy only 1 CD this year, this is the one. Landreth cut his teeth in Lafayette, Louisianna under the tutelage of Clifton Chenier. That ability to entice you to dance infuses his playing. Landreth's stints with John Hiatt have only intensified Haitt's best work and have sent everyone out to copy Landreth, including Buddy Guy.  This set is a loving homage to a venue where he seems to go to some other place altogether with his playing. His bandmates are right there with him at every turn. Landreth's technique is inspiring: his pinky holding down the slide and his other fingers coaxing, massaging and plucking notes and emotions from his six-string. Truly amazing. Landreth is arguably the best slide player ever, and this CD catapults his status out and beyond the reach of mere mortal guitarists. He clearly loves where he is playing and that brings an extra element of passion to the music. This is such a great CD! It isn't ontologically possible to get any better than this.
