 This is Neil at the top of his game. The decade preceding this release saw Young put out all the strongest material that would carry his reputation for the next 25 years. Sure, he would return to form in the late 80's for another strong run, but this is where he and the Horse hit their stride. Crazy Horse is a one trick pony, but that trick is something else when they have it all together, and they have it all together all the way through this DVD.  The stage show is a bit silly in retrospect, the kind of grandstanding he must have done, tongue in cheek, but the music is undeniably powerful. In many cases, these are the definitive versions of these songs, and Young clearly revels in their glories. You'll not find a better version of "Cinnamon Girl" or "Powderfinger" anywhere, and the proof is how well these renditions in particular have stood up. Of course, it would all go south almost immediately after this tour. Becoming a father to two severely handicapped sons, dealing with failed relationships and a new marraige and trying to keep his private life out of the public eye and out of the manipulating hands of David Geffen would result in some truly awful, often bewildering, constantly changing directions that would span the 80's. Not until the Bluenotes Cd and then FREEDOM would Neil find his groove and court passionately his muse again, but at least at this point, it is as though he is that kid on the dock in "Powderfinger" who is just about to see his face flash in the sky.  This is a landmark concert, well worth watching over and over again. The sound transfer is great.
