 informs this CD from the very beginnging of Cockburn's recording career. The music is acoustically driven, and the lyrics more charged by observations of life in Toronto/Ottawa than on a larger world stage. His attentions tend to look and consider the interior spiritual plain as well. As the cover illustrates, this is a winter type of album, to be listened to fireside. Musically the guitar work is just so sublime and amazing! The songs are essentially just Bruce, with occasional accompaniement, such as the complex and yet deeply spiritual pace of "Ting/The Cauldron." It was this early display of his absolutely spiritual commitment to his craft that let anyone who was on to Bruce early know that they were being taken into the confidence of a man with something very deep to convey about Music itself. And the songs include some truly masterful efforts: "One Day I Walk," "Love Song,", "You Point To the Sky." A word about the remastering: it is as sparkling as it can be. Of course, that was the case with the original vinyl and the ESD CD from the 80's. Goes to show what care True North and Bernie Finkelstein put into ensuring and endorsing the quality inherent in Bruce's work. The fact that this was first released in 1971 gives you a sense of the commitment that both artist and management have made to the music. Refreshing, eh?
