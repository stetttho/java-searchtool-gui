 I don't remember liking this especially, or having thought that it could have been better, given this was the core of what was the most creative Yes lineup. But having re-purchased it and set it in the player, I was amazed at how much of this music I really like, and how lyrically, what seemed like Anderson platitudes disconnected from real life, now in the wake of Afghanistan and Iraq, actually come off as quite prescient. What still disconcerts me is Wakeman's wheedling synthesizers. There is a particularly nasal quality they sound that is entirely distracting from what Anderson, Bruford, Levin and Howe are up to. I wonder if it would not have been better to mix him further down and perhaps add some real strings..... The extra texture provided by Tony Levin is what gives this disc a punch unlike any other Yes disc. I intend no slight toward Chris Squire, but in Levin, especially with his rhythm buddy Bruford, an entirely different dialectic is at play. And that dialectic is what makes this CD so alive in the 21st Century. Yes, like King Crimson, was never quite the same when Bruford left. Alan White and Pat Mastellotto are terrific percussionists in their own right, but that isn't the same as Bruford. Bruford's own aesthetic is never more heighthened than when playing against, in the midst of, and in step with Tony Levin. They are God's rhythm section. This was absolutely an Anderson Bruford driven disc. Thank God they did it. It was a glimpse into what might have been, and for that, the disc is a worthy addition to any Yes, Anderson or Bruford fan's collection. Howe must have been in a state of flux with this disc, a state that would not resolve itself until the end of the millenium with MAGNIFICATION. But there are moments.... 14 years later, I am impressed with this disc. Somethings age better than others.
