 Well, here's a niche market that was just screaming out to be exploited. I guess. What's on offer here is an adequate approximation of reggae patois, whatever that really is, less the blunts. In short, bar mitz vah schtick that has found a life of its own. I have no idea if this character is the genuine article or whether this is firmly betwixt the tongue and cheek, but it's cute enough, it's smart enough, and doggone it, some people like it. I'm a bit more enthusiastic about Sinead's foray into her newfound cross-fertilization of Judaism, Islam, Theresa of Avila, Rastafarianism and banshee histrionics than I am 'bout the snap brim oafey dance steps this fella executes, but that's likely splitting hairs, no mean feat when O'C is involved. So as one, two or three-off it's all a bit of harmless fun. Of course, whether the world needs more religion is still a subject of discussion, but then how much more neo christian country music must the world endure. I'm hoping sincerely that there will be a return to human sacrifice and Aztec blood letting, say sampling Barbra Streisand and Celine Dion, produced by Paul Anka with a big band, and then maybe Elvis Costello and Diana Krall will pick up pygmie cannibalism, the Three Tenors could have a turn at the Spanish Inquisition and for extra special treat, a Saami-Bjork-Moby produced Islamic jihadist dancehall throw down.  If there is a God in this world, Yungchen Llamho will release a record soon. That's an awful burden to lay at the feet of so beautiful and spiritual a singer, but I know for a fact she is real. Me? I'm heading back to my cds of Heidegger reading Holderlin, mon.
