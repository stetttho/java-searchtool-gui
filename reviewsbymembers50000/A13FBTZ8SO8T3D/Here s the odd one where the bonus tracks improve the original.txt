 Truth to tell, this was really more a Stills-Nash record as Crosby by his own admission was either missing or barely a participant in the creative and recording process. Look at the DVD of the Daylight Again Tour to see just how scarey a shape Cros is in. In any case, the first half of this CD was a plea to David to get clean and get himsloef in order before he lost his life. Even the incredible "Delta" was Crosby's own acknowledgement of his fsacination with staring into the deep of the river taking his life away. The second half of the original disc never impressed me - too saccarine and sentimental in the case of Nash, too bombast with Stills, and oddly redeemed by Crosby's "Might as well".  The good news here is that the inclusion of three Stills' ottakes and an acosutic demo of "Might as well" take this CD elsewhere altogether. In hindsight, they came up with a much better record. Go figure. They never did it the easy way.  So, I'd highly recommend this disc. Now, if they could just lose that stupid cover art, and get a Henry Diltz photo of early morning in Manassas or the Shenandoah Valley, they might really have something here.
