 .... has a kind of John Hiatt ring to it, eh? Well, this one's a bit more John DiLiberto than John Hiatt, for anyone who wanders around late at night. Until the last two selections, I didn't find this to get going very much beyond the "Buddha Bar" type releases, all vegetarian curry and no meat. But Shankar kicks in on tracks 8 and 9, rescuing the disc from ambient wallpaper. Still, I like it. She has a mastery of her instrument that I wish she would push further, but it's understandable why you'd do a disc like this: it sells, mate. If you are expecting any of the dexterity displayed on THE CONCERT FOR GEORGE, you won't find it here. Mercifully, she doesn't try to sing and leaves that mostly to the male pipes of singers such as Tommy Bose. Too often she is on keyboards and not sitar at all. In fact there are several tracks where she doesn't play anything but keyboards. Huh? That's a bit like having Wu Man play a melotron. I'm sure Wu Man would give it a work out, but why? So, for those looking for yet another reason to chill, you'll love this disc. If you admire and respect Shankar for her amazing gifts as a sitar player, well, forewarned is forearmed. When she credits her half sister Norah, I should have guessed what was on offer.
