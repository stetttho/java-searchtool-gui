 I have to be upfront and say that basically, I don't like this guy. More's the pity for me because he has style in spades. The menus are at times great, at times bs, but it is the setting in which he casts them that sets him apart.  There is much to admire in how the entire look of this book comes off. I'm in the catering business and so I recognize why it is important to light and display the dishes as he does. I also know that, at least in Philadelphia, there are maybe 4 people who can afford this stuff.  Still, it's fun to dream. I fully expect that some self-satisfied gourmand of an SUV-driven horse farm owning young republican wag will be waving this tome in front of me insisting I recreate the magic herein for $30 a head. But I'll try my best not to blame Cowie. I still can't tell if he actually does perform these parties (note I did not say 'cater'), or whether it is all MS photo shoots. They might be real, not everyone in these photos looks that great. Or maybe they just don't stand a chance next to the food, the linens, the candles, the china, etc......
