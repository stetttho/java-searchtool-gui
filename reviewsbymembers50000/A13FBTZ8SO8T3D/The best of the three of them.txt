 and possibly a window on what may be on offer as ProjeKct Six opens for Porcupine Tree in the fall, maybe even an advance screening of the next step with Crim. Returning is one of Belew's signature tunes: "Men In Helicopters" which the Lone Rhino delivers with strings very effectively. Throughout the rest the Tool/Primus rhythm section are dazzling, especially the drummer from Tool. Might we finally have a suitable replacement for Bruford? for Gunn? Don't know if Levin will be back with Crim, but Gunn has left and Mastellotto ought to concede the chair. As for the main lyricist and co-conspirator on guitar, on the basis of this CD, he seems rejuvenated, inspired and just plain old damn good. Hopefully this is the appetizer, ProjeKct Six the intermezzo and a renewed Crim for Main and afters.
