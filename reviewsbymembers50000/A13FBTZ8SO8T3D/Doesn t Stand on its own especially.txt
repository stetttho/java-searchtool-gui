 This is a great film and Gabriel's music works powerfully in the context of the film. In fact it fits so seamlessly, it is almost a non presence. It is only when the movie ends that it strikes you there was a great soundtrack. Taken away from the images of this incredible story, and it really isn't much. Mostly it is atmospherics and a few out-takes from UP, but nowhere near the achievement of "Passion" from the Scorcese film "Last Temptation" or even "Birdy" for that matter. Not much else to say about it really.....
