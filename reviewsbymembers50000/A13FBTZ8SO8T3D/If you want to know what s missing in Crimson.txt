 Look and listen no further than right here. This 2 part live set definitively places Bruford among the greatest, if not the single greatest, drummer ever. EVER. Paired with Dutch pianist Borslap, a brilliant avant garde pianist in his own right, the abstemious Bruford shows you how to play several odd-metre time signatures at once, without resorting to electronic drums. One could argue that the entire trajectory of the electronic drum industry has been to approximate as closely as possible what Bruford effects with 4 appendages and a drum kit. Imagine the pickle that puts chaps like Mastellotto, White, Wallace, Giles, or any other sot who has had the misfortune to follow or precede Bruford in the drum chair.... In any case, this is absolutely compelling stuff and part of Bruford's efforts to disseminate his ouvre, past and present to an audience that is quite ready to journey with him. The live audiences in these two shows is quite THERE at every turn. It is an engaged concert, the kind he commanded when he pushed Belew, Fripp and Levin, among others. Intellectually and passionately this is exceptionally staisfying. This set also helps recast those efforts with Patrick Moraz in the eighties in a new and more expansive light. Make no mistake, this present collaboration is a quantum leap forward.
