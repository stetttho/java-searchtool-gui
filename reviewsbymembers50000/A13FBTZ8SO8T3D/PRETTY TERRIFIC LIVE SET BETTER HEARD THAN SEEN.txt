 Let's just say that Hiatt's live performance shows he's getting a little long in the tooth to be dancing badly to his own songs. Kinda reminds you of your neighbor who still wants to be the life of the party as his kids cringe. So, you're better off listening to a brilliant set who makes a convincing argument for keeping red states as part of the US. Hiatt's down-home hossier-hick is steeped in sincerity, and he's a guy who has made his mistakes, paid for them and found redemption in the simple pleasures of the woman and the children he loves. Admirable, no matter how silly his dance steps. At this point in his career, Hiatt was positively brilliant and all the songs here are his A list material, particularly "Perfectly Good Guitar" and "Buffalo River Home." The audience is with him all the way, and his back up band hits all the marks. If you are a Hiatt fan, you'll treasure this set. It will make you wish John would do this sort of thing more often. Away from the TV lights of ACL, he might even be a little less hokey.
