 If we can't have a full Python project (and with one in the dustbin, how can we), thank God, the nudge-nudge, wink-wink one of them has managed to pull together enough of the energy, wit, ribald humour, and quite clever songs to conquer NYC. More devastating than a flock of Al Qaeyda hijackers, Eric Idle's usurpation of the funny bits across the Python panarama are brilliantly on target. Curry, Hyde Pearce, and the entire cast are perfect. The songs are great tunes with Eric's notoriously irreverent assaults on Jewish impressarios, British royalty, chivalric virtues, and indeed gay men enamoured with show tunes. I have not seen the play yet, and if it continues to outsell all expectations, I may have to settle for a second cast in Philadelphia, but the disc in and of itself is a must have for Idle Python fans, and for anyone who wonders whatever happened to Broadway, Mel Brooks notwithstanding. I have left instructions for a chorus to deliver "The Song That goes Like This" at my own memorial, and you would be well-advised to do the same at your weddings, confirmations, bar and batmiztvahs, garden parties. All that's missing is a dead bishop on the landing, but then no one ever expects....
