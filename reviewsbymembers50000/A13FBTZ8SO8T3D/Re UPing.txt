 This concert is less the tale of a man coming to grips with essential parts of his life coming undone than SECRET WORLD. This is a more lighthearted and playful Gabriel who re-considers the songs from UP as well as assembles a presentation of well known tunes from his canon. In short, this is more concert than concept. And it is a great concert! I did not have the opportunity to catch it live, but the cameras are giving you a multitude of perspectives you would not have caught anyway. The performances are absolutely sterling and there seems to be far less overdubbing on this than there was with SECRET WORLD. Colleagues Levin and Rhodes anchor the drive of Gabriel's music and with Ged Lynch in the drummer's chair, Rachel Z at the keys and daughter Melanie on vocals, the whole effort has a very strong rock instead of world direction. Less the romantic leading man of his last DVD, Gabriel is a bit more computer geek with paunch. Happens to all of us, I guess. In any case his approach is much lighter in humour than UP would have ever suggested. I can remember him sitting on the edge of the stage at the Tower in the course of "Fear is the mother" and freaking out the girls who had come close to caress him by rearing his head back with his eyes rolled up into his skull. No more mental patient on the loose. The fun of doing this concert comes off effectively. It had to have been great fun live, because it is just a real joy to watch on DVD. Among the highlights are The Blind Boys of Alabama, whose harmonizing is absolutely the best thing musically about this concert. It's a great disc to just enjoy for its own sake. I'm sure Gabriel will get back to mythology and ontology later.
