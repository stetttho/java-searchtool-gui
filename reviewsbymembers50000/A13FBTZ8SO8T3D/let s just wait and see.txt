 Having been sorely disappointed with the third film (how can you call this a success when there isn't a trace of Saruman and Wormtongue, when so much time is spent on the affectionate longing amid the lava floes, when no time is given to how war changes the combatants, when the real ending is altered so drastically to fit Jackson's preconceptions?), I have only a fool's hope that this extended version will adress a few of the omissions that made the book such a profound story. Profundity is not the province of cgi geeks, though, is it?
