 From the opening Qawali wail through the final passionate work out from Femi Kuti, this is a very seductive disc, ambient, techno inspired and otherworldly in every respect. I'm way too old to do ecstacy, but, as I listen to this I get that Peter Gabriel sense of "I love to be loved." Indeed, this is all mood enticingly seductive and relaxing. This sets you in a very different fram of mind and should never, never be listened to while driving a car, or operating heavy machinery. Get yourself parked on a sofa, a bed, the bloody floor for that matter with someone you want to squeeze, and take the ride. Techno culprits Ben Hassan and Riccardo Eberspacher and Mars Lasser are featured, and whoever this DJ producer is has done an intoxicatingly good job blending the sirens' calls. I emerged from listening to this for 2 hours like Woody Allen in SLEEPERS with his orgasmatron. This is non essential all the way, but if you have the [$$] to blow on some fun, this is great.
