 This is a real weiner. Peeeeeyew! Hard to believe what these guys once stood for. They should have stuck with live releases during this period because they tended to weed out the [junk] (and this is all scrapple here, folks) and rework what might be of value. But since they put this out, do whatever you can to avoid it. I still shake my head. Geez o man, this just goes to show you what drugs and booze will do to you.
