 As Crosby wandered about as El Dopo, Nash took photos of himself, and Young set about betraying all ala Jean Genet, Stills got himself together, must have swallowed some pride and produced a CD that was, is and remains a sobering account of one's life. More rocking than Dylan's "Blood On The Tracks," this effort laid it out as finely as anything he would ever do what it meant to live one's life with careful reflection. All the songs here are extraordinary, and his tendency towards excess seeps out only with "Love Story", and that suits the song just fine.  Ringo is along for the ride here, Donnie Dacus proves to be an excellent foil for Stills, and nods to Neil in the form of the best version ever of "New Mama" round out an album that begins on a great song "Turn Back the Pages" moves through the brilliant "Favourite Changes" and fulfills everything Stills was capable of. CSN was in free fall. Stills seemed to have nowhere to go with the dissolution of Stills-Young, and faced with this precipice, summoned forth all of his strengths. His guitar playing, particularly his otherwise annoying wah-wah, was at its very best. His voice was terrific, and perhaps this is really his highwater mark as a solo artist.
