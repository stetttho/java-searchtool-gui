 Someone's gonna have to explain this band to me. I've listened to this Cd, the previous one, the Loretta Lynn CD, seen 'em on the TV, and all I hear is something between art school and ugly. Were I Paige or Plant, I'd b-slap the next monkey that compared this duo to L Zeppo (and I HATED Zep). What anybody sees in a guy that can't sing, isn't very good at guitar and a woman who re-set the Karen Carpenter level of drumming LOWER is beyond me. If you really think this where music is going, god help the rest of us. The saving grace here is that they make Sleater Kinney worth listening to. So when does that John Hiatt disc come out?
