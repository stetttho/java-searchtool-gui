 It's a good job I wasn't eating my cereal listening to this disc. There'd be Cheerios everywhere. Osms Vanska's take on 4 & 5 is met out with a sense of purpose, in fact, a very youthful determination, which gave me the impression that the symphony moved with a dynamic I haven't heard before. Kind of like a Robert Fripp and King Crimson approach to Beethoven, via the double trio. In other words, this aint von Karajan or Ozawa. No long drawn out pathos, no sense of an older man contemplating his fate. More of an intentionality and direction is on offer here. It is a different reading, and it works, but, as I say, mind the flakes and the raisins. The Minnesota team is recorded intimately and that makes for a fascinating listen. It could be me, but I was more aware of double basses, winds, horns and tympani than I ever have with these two symphonies. If it is so, I can't help but think that LB would be smiling broadly. The Fourth begins with a barely audible whisper and whips itself into a frenzy worthy of Crimson at its most ferocious. The Fifth is, as I say, less contemplating fate than determined to address it. Both head towards those great Beethoven finales. Lord, he loved a big finish. And you'll feel completely swept away by them with an exhilaration. Quite an adrenalin rush. Often themes are slightly blurred in the Fourth. Vanska makes that something to celebrate. He must have been impressed with the results, for he moves with nary a breath from the third into the fourth movements of #5 so dramatically, that I had to check the CD spinner to see which track I was on. It all works, and this is a dramatic new reading (for me, anyway) of two pieces I know so well that I ma thrilled by the recording. I suspect Vanska likes a quicker tempo anyway, if you refer to his reading of Rautavarra's 8th it's also one that moves along. No dawdling about navel gazing for this guy. Well worth the price and something to get you out of bed in the morning to boot.
