 The main difference here is that the director of this film got a more impassioned performance from Skaarsgard and cast than Paul Schrader. This fails mostly on the throwback reliance on Friedkinesque special effects. Sorry, but we did that already. Maybe on the large screen it came off better, but having watched Schrader's version first, I was convinced that it was the better story of the two. Much goes unexplained here, and in fact this film almost pre-supposes that you've seen Schrader's version for the background. There are huge gaps in why things happen in the sequence they do, and yet elipitical references are amde to film Schrader shot. Quite odd. On its own merits, everyone looks more involved in the picture. For Skaarsgard, he has a prettier, sexier Rachel to work with. This actress doesn't exude the guilt of the actress in Schrader's film, but she has asmoldering sexuality and a body to match. The reference to the Psycho shower scene comes off effectively. Ben Cross makes a cameo to begin and end the story that would have worked especially well in Schrader's film. And that's the odd part. Were you to select the better parts of each film, you would have had a really terrific thriller. Where this one falls down is the gore and goofy satanism. I can't imagine that Lucifer is that much of a dweeb. I watched both on Halloween, copied them onto my hard rive and hope to release my own synthesis in China in the next few weeks. That is the plan, anyway. See you all in Shanghai.
