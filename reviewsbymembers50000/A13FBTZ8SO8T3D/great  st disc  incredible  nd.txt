 When this first came out, it was deservedly recognized with grammy nominations. The set featuring Johnny Winters is so good, you hardly notice the distraction Winters represented. "Mannish Boy," "She's 19," and "Deep Down in Florida" are remarkable workouts. Winters has an annoying slide guitar in his own catalogue, but here, trying to squeeze in among Muddy's sidemen, he's kept in check. He did a great job on the production and remastering, and the set has a presence it did not have digitally at first. There is a comment among the reviewers that prefers the vinyl, but I'd say this remaster is better. However, it's the second disc that makes this essential listening. Stripped of the record label presence, and allowed to do their thing, this is a more accurate reading of just how incendiary Muddy Waters and his band were on any given night. Be it the loose boogie of "Pinetop's Boogie" or the white hot tear down of "Mojo", this set just blazes, smokes and leaves the first disc in the dust. That's true of most of that vinatge of Chicago bluesmen: the whiteboys should have stayed at the bar. They tended to slow things down and dilute the feral power. "Champagne and Reefer" and "Hoochie Coochie Man" fry the audience on both sides. This is a terrific club set and well worth the price all by itself. Muddy Waters was so importnat to post WW2 music that you ought to seek out any of his recordings. But it was live that set him apart from everyone else. Both of these discs illustrate that categorically.
