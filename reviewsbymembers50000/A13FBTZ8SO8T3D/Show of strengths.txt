 Altan's other fiddler, Ciaran Tourish, has released a CD that focuses on the music he loves, and as such, it has a far more personal feel and direction than most Irish fiddle solo CDs. Ciaran loves Allison Krauss and Union Station, and the track with them is one of the highlights of this disc. You could see him working with them seamlessly. Even Paul Brady is good on this disc. I tend to think Brady kills the momentum of any disc on which he appears, but even his inept lyrics on the second track do not deter the feel of this disc. Brady and Arty McGlynn are the guitarists throughout most of the disc. The music plays to all of Tourish's strengths and moves along wonderfully. I was surprised when it was over. I'll return to this a lot. Hopefully, the experience will propel his contributions in Altan further along and keep that band fresh. The LOCAL GROUND CD is the best post Frankie Kennedy CD they've released, and you'd hope that a solo project like this will encourage Tourish to hone an ever finer edge with Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh and her colleagues.
