 If you have followed the history of Fripp's comments on Crim, you know he harboured no great love for this record. Nonetheless it is an important document vindicating that this formation of KC was much better than its reputation. Considered a sloppy blowing band saddled with naff material, based on the legacy of their studio effort, the Collins, Wallace and Burrell partnership with Fripp is too often skipped over. The joy in this outfit was their playing. Perhaps more Cannonball Adderly than John Coltrane or Ornette Coleman, nonetheless they could swing instrumentally. They had a firm foundation in the blues, as Burrell and Wallace and Collins would demonstrate post-Crim. Burrell, brave soul that he was, gave it his best, but neither his voice nor the loopy lyrics of Sinfield, who was thankfully about to be out of the picture, ever quite matched up in any convincing way.  So the great thing about this CD is that there are precious few vocals. The maddening partof it is the editing. Lord knows why some things fade in, or are edited abruptly. One can readily understand Fripp's frustration with this document. But for all its warts and blemishes, there is great stuff going on here. At times in the improv, the band is clealry circling the airport, looking for a place to land before it runs out of fuel, but at other times, it seems to leap with total abandon. Fripp once commented that the great thing about an amateur versus a professional was that an amateur, because they do it for the love of doing it, isn't aware of his limitations, and so consequently, frequently exceeds them. That is what you'll find on this disc. There are a lot of reasons to skip it in your collection if you have a fixed notion of Crimson, but if you want to hear a band working without a net, not always to success, this is a brillaint piece of work.
