 The cringe factor here is enormous. Hiatt is a little long in the tooth (and this is 12 years ago) to be dancing like a hoosier hick whose kids are hiding. And the rest of the band could give Tom Petty and his mob a run in the dead-ugly department. but who really cares if you keep the tube off and just listen. The sound quality is excellent. So is the video, if you can stand it. (Prince he ain't - in fact he should take serious notes from Will Smith in Hitch about men dancing). The crowd got one if the real stand out performances from anybody on that show and it rocks start to finish. This one and Richard Thompson's set are brilliant. Where's Neil and the International Harvesters? Likely hell will freeze over before Shakey lets that out of the can. Anyway for Hiatt, this is a triumph. His material is terrific and he leaps thumps into it with enthusiasm. Absolutely worth the price. If he sells enough, he can go to Arthur Murray.
