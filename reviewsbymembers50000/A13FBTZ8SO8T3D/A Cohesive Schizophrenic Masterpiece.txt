 What works against this CD is what works for it: this is very clearly a patched together release of two very different projects that had likely been started andd stopped by Young as he switched gears in mid-stream. "Funny how some things that begin spontaneously, end spontaneously, heh heh" Well this, then, is pure Neil. Thing of it is, it is just loaded with brilliant work: "Star of Bethlehem" with Emmy Lou Harris is a thing of beauty, not to be repeated until their duet on her version of "Wrecking Ball" 25 years later. Linda Ronstadt and Nicollette Larsen deliver the goods throughout the first side. It is an acoustic wonder, absolutely pristinely recorded, full of nuances and an edge that for all intents and purposes was marking the end of this style of song from Young. These are the final descendants of "Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing".  Meanwhile, over on the electric side is "Hurricane," one of the greatest Young songs ever, and the song that somehow resuscitated and redeemed the reputation of Crazy Horse. Lord only knows how they could be so horrible on almost every occasion and then somehow come off with this. If everything else on this CD were just impossible to listen to, "Hurricane" would none the less justify the purchase. The remastering job here is a thing of beauty. Keeping with the schizoid nature of this CD, the cover "art" is certainly in the worst of all possible tastes, but the music, oh the music, blows you away. "Will to Love" marks the end point of a period for Neil. All the extraordinary and disturbing events of his most horrific personal years had been unable to defeat him. This tune, like McCartney's "She's Leaving Home," hits the heart as few other pieces in the popular cannon ever have. Absolutely, this is essential listening. The Japanese version of this has had live performances of this and other unreleased material from this period. Pity Young did not extend the schizophrenia just a bit more...
