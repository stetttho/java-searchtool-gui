 This happened to be an incredible disc and an overwhelming video, given his declining health. Now that the Man in Black has left us, it rises in ways no one could have foreseen. It is a GREAT CD! Rarely has anyone put together a collection of songs so thoroughly interconnected. All of the themes deal with death, redemption, forgiveness, the sublimely subtle details of honest hearts. These songs are presented so unaffectedly that it is in fact a virtual textbook lesson in songcraft. "Danny Boy" is resurrected. "Hurt" has never been more effectively performed. Cash's opening title tune, "The Man Comes Around," is so phenomenally prescient it is scarey. The extended version of this set comes with the vieo for "Hurt", which makes this essential recording a categorical imperative for anyone who finds meaning in American song. Johnny Cash was the genuine article. The diamond in his soul has never shone more brilliantly than on this CD. That leaves Gordon Lightfoot, Willie Nelson, John Hiatt and precious few others who have actually lived and found some wisdom in the process.
