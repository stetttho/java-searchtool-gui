 I have to stop buying this clown's music. I keep thinking he is going to either come up with something as brilliant as his first five CDs, or at least as emotionally moving as the collaboration with Burt Bacharach. This is as thrilling as a Steve and Edie concert in Atlantic City or Mitzi Gaynor at a music fair tent. In short, if you're not jonesing for the borscht and supper club belt of years gone by, skip this. Declan has lost all concept of restraint. "Less is more" has vanished from his noetical library, and so you have what is essentially an orchetra waiting for the return of the Rat Pack, playing back up to a real rat. It's over blown, over orchestrated, and the new material doesn't stack up. At all. The SOGNO material is a bad dream that should never have been foisted on an unsuspecting public. Like the tedious JULLIET LETTERS, it is a monotone recantation of what EC liked in the Tempest. Too precious by at least half. If you're the kind of music fan looking for an older era to be re-born, say someone who just LOVED that last Carly Simon record, then you'll swoon and swing to this junk. For the rest of us, God willing there is another punk rebellion in the works. You'd only get away with this if you had the celebrity of MacManus. I'm putting my Graham Parker back in the Cd player, his most recent bootleg with the Twang Three being among the best live recordings of the past 5 years.
