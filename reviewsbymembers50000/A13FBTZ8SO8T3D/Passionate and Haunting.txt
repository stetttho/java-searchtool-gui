 Full of forboding, as the times and the setting of this story surely were, this soundtrack to the masterpiece film is a superb achievement. The story concerns the decaying European presence and lurking American infiltration as the tragedy in Viet Nam began its climactic epoch. The film is based on Graham Greene's novel that set out a parable of how first European and then North American interests set about exploiting the intoxicating beauty that is Viet Nam and her people. As such, it was banned in the US for a long time. Most of my Viet Namese friends read this book translated as "The Sinister American", and so it is. The music evocatively conveys the intrigues, the languor, the duplicities that flow underneath the surface of this story. Through the music, the incredible voice of Hong Nhung floats in and out, subtley conveying the sense that the Viet Namese are aware and counting out time until the moment is pregnant. Viet Namese singers like Hong or Huong Thanh are forces of sublime passion to be reckoned with and Craig Armstrong beautifully and seamlessly integrates and weaves the seductive magic of these voices and the traditions from which they sprang into this compelling soundtrack. Viet Nam is not all Martin Sheen and Marlin Brando, Oliver Stone and Stanley Kubrik. In fact these latter day westerners were just another in the parade of those who woul like to sleep with Viet Nam and walk away self-satisfied. The Viet Namese bid their time. Their cultural take on what happened is advanced by this film and this music.
