 There isn't a thing wrong with the musicianship on this account of mid seventies Traffic. It is a bit tedious though, and likely set the pattern for supergroup live albums for quite some time. Traffic was running out of gas by this stage in their career. Chris Wood was not in the best of health, nor was Jim Gordon. Jim Capaldi and Steve Winwood would spend quite a few years recovering from the final crash before venturing into their very strong solo careers. These were the long songs, and while both Capaldi and Winwood could extrapolate brilliantly on a theme, this CD has the sense of having gone on too long. It tends to circle around for a while and then end. The defining track seems to be "Uninspired". {Perhaps Winwood and Capaldi had had enough and this is contractual obligation stuff. It is by no means bad, but this is definitely a band at the end of the road.
