 keep it out has been a passionate avocation for Robert Fripp from those first terrifying moments when he heard the conclusion to "A Day In The Life", Bartok's quartets, and Hendrix's opening riff to "Purple Haze." in the course of his career he has often been a lone voice crying in the wilderness, yet one where Bowie, Eno, the Roches, and countless others have turned to for some realization of what remains ineffable.  In the course of said trajectory he has also brought into this world first Fripperttronics with Eno, and now Soundscapes, with his Moon module set of delays, loops, sequencers and trusty Gibson and Fernandez guitars. What is on offer here is perhaps some of the most beautiful, some of the saddest, and some of the most profound music you will ever hear. Not since Barber's Adagio or his own BLESSING OF TEARS have I heard music so powerfully emotive, so respectful of lives lost, so committed to turn the various fetishizations that consume our pitiable species into something other, something more beautiful, more sacred. The pieces here are from the World Financial Center, both before and after 9-11, they are a memorial on his Mother's birthday, they are a celebration of the artist who has drawn most of the Soundscape covers, and they are an incantation of nine affirmations that reach to our very principle of life.  This is the Crimson King's Prime Minister wondering what can be wrought that might give us pause to consider walking a different path. It ought to be sent to every world leader.
