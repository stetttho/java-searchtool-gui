 This is a very fine concert in a small club with terrific songs, a pumped audience and a band that knows what to do and when to do it. Add in Emmylou Harris, and what you have is an essential document. EC needs to look at this DVD every time he imagines he's Arvo Part or Mel Torme, or whatever other preposterous notion fills his head. Even more, his record label should have thid DVD playing everytime he pitches some monotonous idea at them. If ever there was an argument for not allowing an "artiste" to express himself, Costello is it. Within the confines of rock music he writes some great tunes and witty, if verbose, lyrics. The boy likes to impress himself, and often enough it works, mate. Stick to the knitting. This concert crackles from the very start. This band has the juice and the sophistication to tackle chestnuts and new songs with aplomb. And as I say, add in Emmylou Harris, and you have an extraodinary show. Harris manages to elevate the quality, the passion, the soulfulness of anything and everything she is involved in, be it music, film, or standing in line at Starbucks. She eclipses the pudgy runt from Liverpool with grace and humanity and takes what are very good songs on their own terms and recasts them altogether in more sublime lighting. Hers is the voice touched by God or Music itself and the gang here owe her a big debt. If you are a Costello fan, and sometimes I am, you will welcome a return to what he should be doing. If you're a Harris fan, you'll find plenty here to appreciate.
