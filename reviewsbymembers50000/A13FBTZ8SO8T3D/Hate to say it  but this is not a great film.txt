 Don Cheadle and Sofie Okonedo are absolutely amazing and entirely believeable as a couple caught in the maelstrom of this atrocity, but the film fails to deliver the real sense of horror and abandon that KILLING FIELDS or HARRISON'S FLOWERS conveyed of a world gone insane. And this was an insanity fueled by a pernicious racism that feigned innocence under the Clinton and Blair regimes. What I didn't like was the movie never gets going and involves you the way the stories of Dith Trang and Harrison did. It touches the historical basues, but actors walk on and deliver the lines, the scenes are all shot the same way and the soundtrack underscores precious little.  It was made for all the right reasons, it's just that in the hands of Terry George, it is a little too cliched and stereotyped without a sense of the seething betrayal needed for people to massacre each other. It's as though the film was done by rote. Apart from the two protagonists, the film really doesn't give you a sense of drama unfolding. If you are even superficially aware of this story, you'd find yourself wondering why things happened as they did, who were the real criminals, and what hypocritical chutzpah it took for Clinton to fein sympathy and concern while never leaving the airport. There is a much more incendiary story to tell here. Terry George just couldn't find it.
