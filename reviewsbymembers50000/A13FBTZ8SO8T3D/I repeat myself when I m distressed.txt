 well, Ian Wallace has had the double misfortune of preceding Bill Bruford in the drum chair and following Bruford back into jazz (not that Bill was his intentional mentor, it just sequentially worked out that way). He also was saddled with the most maligned line-up of Crim, one that on its studio releases might have earned the approbriations, but on its live Collectors Club releases redeemed itself with astounding power. Herein, then, is an entirely energetic and fun way to appreciate what Crimson's music can be, under a different set of circumstances. The Trio are brilliant musicians, they approached the heavy mental structures of the music on offer here with a great spirit, and it sounds like they had a very creative ball in the process. If you are a Crimson fan, you'll already have an open enough sensibility to appreciate the directions the trio takes. If you are simply curious how anyone could redeem Cat's Food or Ladies of the Road, then you'll be amazed at how underneath the surface of that mud, there was indeed more mud, but also something you could sculpt into a formidable tune. Before Fripp makes good on his threats to hang it up and fly away, I sincerely hope there is time for he and Wallace to collaborate again on music, for no other reason than Wallace seemed to be the only drummer Fripp deeply liked, and Ian seemed to be able to make Fripp laugh, in public. Not a bad thing. As a wiser person than I once remarked, "yer not right if ye don't laugh." Aye. It might even be great fun, with nary a moment's repitition. Right up Fripp's street I should think....
