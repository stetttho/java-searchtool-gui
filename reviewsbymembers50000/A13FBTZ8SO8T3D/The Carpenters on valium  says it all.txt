 Di Liberto's quip sums this up. I defy anyone to tell one Enya CD from another, and this is no exception. That said, regurgitating the same set of reverb certainly buys you a nice castle south of Dublin. Living next door to Bono hasn't done anything for her sense of adventure musically, but she knows what her public will swallow gladly. The pretentiousness of "inventing" a "language" speaks for itself. In fact, spills out volumes. Perhaps she'll have a tryst with Jon Anderson and the world will implode with the arrival of their demon child. In the meantime, I'd like to think the world has moved beyond this treacle. Not so....
