 You can count on Graham Parker to deliver the goods without grousing about it a la Van Morrison, or being just too precious for his own self a la Declan MacManus, and on this vitriolic and venomous release Parker's slings his poisoned arrows on target and with a beat you can dance to. I've enjoyed his momentary bucolic moments as much as trhe revved up rockers, and this fall squarely in the latter category. Recorded in tony Bryn Mawr, a more incongruous place for GP I can not imagine, the ambient sound is full and immediate and Parkers enlists an able ensemble of Main Line band mates to carry off the mission at hand. They are very much on the page with GP and each track crackles, pops, spits fire. "Vanity Press" is classic bile with a steady beat and "Bad Chardonnay" casts the career of an aging rocker in proper focus way beyond the petulant whining of the fatuous Van. "She swallows It" uses sexual metaphor for the way some women will enable a liar to perpetuate his bad behaviour. You get the picture: Graham tackles the underbelly of common life with a sharp, incisive, sometimes ironic and always pointed approach. One of the other things you can count on is that Parker has an unerringly bad taste in cover graphics. While not as bad as ACID BUBBLEGUM, this CD booklet is a real horror. But that what makes Parker such an enjoyable listen. He'll never accede to glamour and PR. He's a right prickly bramble and God Bless Him for it.
