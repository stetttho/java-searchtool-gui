 and don't get me wrong, this is a very good acoustic set from Los Lobos, but it has the feel of being culled from various recordings. There is no build up of memntum, and I don't think this was set up as a cohesive project. The outstanding moments are "Two Janes". "Guantanamera" and "Maricella". In fact at the conclusion of "Maricella," it feels like the set is about to take off. Instead, additional songs sound like Los Lobos is idling on the runway.  I can recall outstanding moments throughout the times I have seen them, and have found the Live at the Fillmore Set from this year less than satisfying. This set just seems to be a smattering of live acoustic traditional Mexican tunes, delivered competently, and a few notable numbers from their catalogue. Somehow, I'd expect more than competency from them....
