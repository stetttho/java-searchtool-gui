 Bobby Mc Ferrin has produced a CD of unparalleled beauty and power. If all you know of McFerrin is his hit, forget that altogether. This is music with soul, spirit, intelligence and passion, and his accomplices in this effort, especially Richard Bona, have produced a work that will be listened to hundreds of years from now. This is creative virtuosity, passionate singing and phenomenal dynamics in the service of conveying something deeply personal. Something more fundamental to being alive, I can not imagine. You will dance, cry, pray, love, worship as you listen to the music on this disc. I urge you now, stop reading this note and rush to get this disc. You will never be the same.
