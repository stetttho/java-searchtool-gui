 The essential thing here is that these songs, culled mostly from YANKEE FOXTROT & A GHOST work so much more effectively and urgently in a live context than they ever did on the studio efforts that you're not wrong if you were to suggest to Tweedy the following: 1. the first record company wasn't all wrong 2. perhaps they should have been done live from the get-go and most importantly: 3. it's time ti re-unite with Jay Farrar and Mike Heidorn  There is a lot less, actually make that none, of the lethargy that these songs had as studio productions. The hometown crowd is way into it as well, and that brings an anthemic quality that was missing before. The level of musicianship is direct and uncompromising, and the urgancy, the "in the moment" quality of this recording makes it Wilco's best CD by a very considerable long shot. "I am trying to Break Heart" is an altogether brilliant new song in this concert, which alone would justify the purchase. Listen to the rest of it and all the feedback, distortion, collected sounds that were curios now have a point.  The net effect of the whole effort, though, is that it's time for he and Farrar to pull their considerable talents together and put Uncle Tupelo back into the mix. Maybe that's a bit like asking Stills, Young and Furay to put Buffalo Springfield back on track, but on the tsrength of the live and studio releases from Farrar this year and on the strength of this one, it's time, lads.
