 The reason to re-purchase this disc is the sound on the DVD 5.1 channel side. It is sublime, superb, superior to the already high standards Bowie established with the original release. There are format wars brewing with HDDVD and Blue-ray formats arriving at the end of 2005, but likely they will be a pricey notch up as the studios re-tread their releases. For the moment, and for my money, the sound on this disc is superior to the sound on the SACD release. There is both depth and warmth to the disc, and the separation is terrific. There is, as well, a film. Very arty stuff, but that goes with Bowie. All in all, I would hope that there will be more, especially from artists who actually care what their discs sound like. I'd love to hear a DVD Audio or a dual-disc DVD sound of The Band's THE BAND, or Van Morrison's AVALON SUNSET, or near anything from Gabriel, Knopfler and the Blue Nile, so hopefully there is impetus on the horizon before we all have to re-buy our favourites in what will be the next format war. Get this one, though, as you'll love every second of music here in.
