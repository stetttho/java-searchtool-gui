 Ho Xuan Huong was an 18th Century concubine with a very feminist determination to write about the seductive elements of life and in a number of the poems here you'll see why she must have caused quite a stir. Her sexuality simmers just below the surface of these poems, or in some cases, slyly evokes the delights she knows well in analogy. What is at first reading a song about sowing is an admonition to young women to luxuriate in the langour of passion, a kind of Bonnie Raitt take on the joys of gettin' jiggy with it. One of the interesting elements of the book's production is the presentation on the Viet Namese adaptation of Chinese caligraphy as well as the contemporary Viet Namese lettering, along with the English translation. The foreword is well documented and instructive. My only carp is that as with any translation from an expressive and lyrical language like Viet Namese, something gets lost. It hits you because you get an inkling why Ho Xuan Huong was so controversial, and you'd somehow like to get closer to her to really feel what made her senses reel. I don't speak Viet Namese, so more's the pity in my case. However, this is well worth exploring, very seductive stuff to share with a lover.
