 I liked the film in general. It was an unbelievable story and Brody was terrific in the part. However, as it rolled on in the theatre I found myself ticking off when the ghetto uprising would start, when the deportations would start, when the russians would start, and realized that, inspite of it being an absolutely horrific period in history, the pacing of this movie is way too familiar. For me it di not have the heartbreaking drama of Schindler's story, and in fact seemed too often to too closely mirror it. I was not aware that this was a true story (I tend to live under a rock), so I thought some of what this poor man goes through to be incredulous, and when it looked like he might be shot at the end by mistake, I presumed it was just another manifestation of Polanski's sick imagination. Finding out that it was true did not move me any closer to the heart of the story. See for yourself. As a film, it has undeniable strong points technically. As a story, I just kept thinking that this was redundantly Schindler.
