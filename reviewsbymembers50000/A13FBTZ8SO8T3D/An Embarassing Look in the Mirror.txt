 The value of this set is that it shows what was so incredibly brilliant about Santana, and how it all went terribly wrong. The first CD presents the ctaegorical argument that Santana was  ( and really still is) the greatest Latin guitarist, possibly the greatest Latin jazz guitarist, and definitively the best blues guitarist to have emerged from the sixties. His music is as fresh today as it was upon arrival. The second CD evdiences how the thread was lost. Second rate collaborators with no feel for his inspiration conspired to produce some of the most horrible sounding pop/disco/dance music ever made that has only become worse over time. The production values that once added so much depth and soul to his music have become thin and superficial. It would not be until he realigned himself with John Lee Hooker that Carlos would shake himself out of the bad dream in which his music had gotten lost. The music from 1978 through 1989 is so bad, he actually makes Neil Young's contemporaneous slide in taste look like a work of well considered genius. Thankfully for all of us, Santana recovered his vision and mission. I admire his bravery in releasing this set. It shows his integrity. Let's hope it never happens again, for his sake, most of all.
