 When you're a big time rock star, you get to get away with junk like this. Ever the meticulous craftsman in the studio, Young took his first take work ethic to new lows with this garbage. No one really cares what the motivatiuons were for this dismal run through of simply stupid material, if you were dumb enough to buy it on vinyl, there's no need to attempt to resurrect your pride extolling this slagheap as an underappreciated masterpiece.  YIKES! The musicianship is horrible: remember, this is Crazy Horse: try to imagine how bad horrible Crazy Horse must be. There are no lyrics worth preserving and Young sings like dinner's on the table and he better get in before it gets cold. Thanks, Neil. We all owe you one.
