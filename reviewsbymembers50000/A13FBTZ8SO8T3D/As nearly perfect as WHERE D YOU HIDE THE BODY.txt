 Really ought to rate it 4.75, but the point is that this is a gem from McMurtry, better focused with a more engaging set of stories than he has delivered since WHERE,  and that is not to suggest there's anything wrong with the intervening releases. This CD just takes it elsewhere altogether. There is no breakout song like "Leveland", but this CD hangs together with such an emotional thoroughness that you don't need a standout track. The musicianship is superb. I like McMurtry's guitar playing here more than I ever have and his sardonic yet compassionate skewering of red state mentality is less polemical than the live CD, and so more profoundly to the heart of a group people who want to be led. There are no independent thinkers in McMurtry's worlds - when they do think for themselves, it all goes tragically wrong. Rather than pillory them, McMurtry shows the human scale to failure and while you don't necessarily want to reach out and hug these people, you get the point that but for a break here and there and a few dollars, that could be you, mate, that he's singing about. I'd highly recommend this CD to anyone interested in unaffected and direct story-telling - there has never been a writer quite like McMurtry - think Elvis Costello without the boorish pretensions - well, you can't actually as there'd be nothing left. Never mind, Jame sis his own man anyway. Maybe Randy Newman in the early days with a rootsier sense of rhythm. Whatever. McMurtry delivers a remarkable collection of songs, and this is one of his very best CDs.
