 Maybe this guy is a one trick pony, but as brilliant as Sixth Sense was, Unbreakable was horrible. This film is somewhere in the middle. Perhaps its tremendous sales figures come from everyone in Bucks County seeing it 12 times.  Scarey movies and comedies are the 2 toughest films to do well, and while this is beautifully shot, it looks as though you are seeing repeats of cinematic devices used to better effect in 6th. All of his trademark devices are there: kids in suspense, adults talking in whispers, cameo by the director, (where's Willis?) but while I love the idea of de-Spielbergizing ET, this comes off as an overlong episode of the Outer Limits.  It's OK, just I don't get the fuss. Mel Gibson seems bent on tackling Michael Caine's "I'll do any movie" approach toward film roles, and while he is quite believable, one misses the edge he used to bring to roles. Phoenix is excellent, and really the best thing about this film. The corn fields in Doylestown are beautiful. And if you ever drive through Bucks these days, you'll notice that the invasion is from Real Estate merchants and not ETs. Oh that a toss of water would make them disappear.  Wait! Wasn't there some movie in the 30's that made the villain disappear with water? hmmm, I must be melting. I see dead scripts.
