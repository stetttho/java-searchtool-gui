 Lisa Gerard's latest, this time with fellow Irish composer Patrick Cassidy, is one of the most hauntingly beautiful CDs I have heard since Robert Fripp's BLESSING OF TEARS. Beginning with the Arameic "Maranatha" the tones are set in her cross cultural exploration of what provokes the soul to contemplate its fate. The art work throughout the booklet augments the music as few other graphic designs ever do. Much as John Miller's work captured an essential visual in Robert Fripp's Soundscapes, so to does the imaginative use of film and superimposed images work for Gerrard. A quotation from Yeats, the Aramaic transcription of "The Lord's Prayer", a couple of poems and a few lines from Milton resound powerfully through the layers of soundscapes that Cassidy and Gerrard sculpt. In many ways, her spiritual power puts me in mind of Rautavaara and John Taverner. There is both a Baltic and Byzantine influence that weaves seamlessly with her very powerful Celtic spirituality. I would imagine that this is a deeply personal effort for both of them, particulaly Cassidy, who comes from an enormously influential family of musicians. His Gaelic speaking cousins, Na Cassaidaigh, reset the bar dramatically for Gaelic song in the 80's and 90's and were in no small measure among the artists, including Andy Irvine, who were unceremoniuosly and uncreditedly pinched by Riverdance. No matter, this is light years away from Radio City Music Hall. This music of deep solitude that reverberates in those quiet moments when your guard drops, a slight disturbance in the calm reflection, suggests that something ineffable in your life has changed. If you have admired Gerrard's work with Brendan Perry in Dead Can Dance, or her soundtracks for such movies as "The Insider", you will get blown away by this incredible disc. Put this and Habib Koite's FOLY CD on your must have list this year - for very different muisc, but absolutely artists at the peak of their powers.
