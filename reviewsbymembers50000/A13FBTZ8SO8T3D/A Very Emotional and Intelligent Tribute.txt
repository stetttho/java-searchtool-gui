 Inspite of having been a fan for a very long time, I was amazed by how much I learned about Joni Mitchell as a woman and an artist. Her courage, her integrity, the enormous sacrifices and the very bold daring to lay it out and reach people with her thoughts  and emotions are all the more underscored by this remarkable flim. Her best songs, her best friends, her achievements and disappointments are all detailed here. The footage of her in concert is brilliant. Her honesty rules at all moments, and perhaps with all the posturing and self-righteousness that pervade music now, it is uncannily refreshing to listen to her once more, with very open ears. I understood exactly the breakdown and recovery she went through from BLUE to FOR THE ROSES, retreating to Canada, and I can understand what is so important about such a retreat. It seems to be for her like Coltrane's retreat to his home in Philly to beat heroin, only to re-emerge as the most forward thinking artist of his generation, spiritually renewed and with a vision clearly in focus. Mitchell seems to have undergone a similar spiritual conversion and when she came back from the wilds, she was prepared to journey where none of her contemporaries could imagine.  Her romances, particularly with Graham Nash and Larry Klein are presented beautifully. Her collaborations with the very best in jazz: Mingus, Metheny, Jaco, Shorter: are in retrospect incredible artistic achievements, regardless of the criticism of the folk-rock nazis of the time. She connects with people, especially artists who are trying to make sense of the world and the lives we are given. Her mission to find her daughter re-oriented her priorities profoundly. This woman has travelled quite a road. Her hejira has captivated us. This film is a great tribute to an incredible woman.
