 Still don't get the name, but that's all right. The set here is quite inclusive and it charts well the trajectory of this band from a solo excursion by Steve Wilson into a working quartet. The renewed interest in the back catalogue spurred Wilson into re-mastering, and in some cases enhancing, his oeuvre. It's well worth it. Having come on to this band only recently, I'm glad to have picked this up. There are a lot of rarities on these discs that serve the reputation PT has built well. I like all of them. For the future, both in concert and on compilation, I sincerely hope "Radioactive Toy" disappears. It is a juvenile Pink Floyd knock off that might have been OK at 3 minutes, but in its current renditions wears out its welcome quickly and repeatedly. It is a dumb song with a banal lyric. Wilson needs to get past it. "Stars Die" is nearly the best track on this set, along with "Sever" and his 18 minute opus. But all of it works superbly. Once PT becomes a 4 piece, and in concert 5 piece, band, there is a dramatic jump forward in sophistication and dynamics. Wilson's writing expands as well. So all in all, this is an informative as well as entertaining retrospective.  Still I'd take the WARSAW live disc, In Absentia, and Deadwing over all. Those three are ones you can hnag your credibility on for all time.
