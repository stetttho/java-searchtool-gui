 Culled from a radio broadcast (and who told the moron announcer it was OK to talk over Coltrane?), and discovered among a collection of tapes in the family archives, this is one of John's very best live dates, and as everyone is pointing out, including his esteemable son, you see here how the transition was being made in the course of John's music. What's also on offer here is just how much he and Elvin Jones were on each other's pages. I have rarely heard such a sympatico among two musicians, even more so than Coltrane's rapport with Miles. That's sticking it way out there, but I can think only of Hendrix and Mitchell, Fripp and Bruford, as being in the same aether. This is a club date and has a better than expected sonic quality to it, considering the source. Along with the Monk/Trane concert from Carnegie Hall released last month, this represents the second major release of significant recordings from a man who was at his most stunningly spiritual in a live context. Let's hope the family uncovers more, even if the sound is less than pristine. We all survived the OLATUNJI tapes in one piece, and the sound quality was horrendous, but no matter, it had enormous importance in the discography of John Coltrane. That same ethic ought to guide any and all future considerations.
