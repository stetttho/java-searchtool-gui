 Left to his own devices, Clapton is never his own best friend musically. His first collection of pop songs since his efforts for Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Robert Johnson, as well as his own substance abuse clinic, this is not strong material, especially his stuff. The instrumentation is incredibly tight, but the material just never grabs you, but for one song, George Harrison's "Love Comes To Everyone." The rest is not as treacly as your standrad Sting or Rod Stewart record, but after having had such a brilliant run with The Concert For New York, The Concert for George, Brainwashed, the two Robert Johnson CDs, the Guitarfest Concert, the One More Rider Live CD, BACK HOME is a disappointment and rather lifeless. Plus, I just can't wrap my aesthetic sensibilities around Clapton singing about changing nappies.... It's just wrong.
