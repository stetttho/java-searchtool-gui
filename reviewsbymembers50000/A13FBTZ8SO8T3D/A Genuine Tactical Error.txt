 Who knows what caused the rift, but somehow after "Tormato" YES had fallen apart, perhaps by virtue of having run out of ideas and patience with keyboard players. So Chris Squire sought to soldier on with Steve Howe and Alan White and recruited 2 session player/producers to alter the formula. They did. But actually, only the traditional YES vehicle, Tempus Fugit, cuts the mustard. The rest is forgettable.  Everyone is a fine musician here, it's just that this does not click. The disaster would become compounded when Anderson regrouped with Bruford, Wakeman, and again Howe to release a YES album in all but name. And to rub salt in Squire's wound, employing Tony Levin among others for bass duties.  If you are a completist, then perhaps this is worth it. Yes had great moments, bloated moments, and horrendous missteps. This is the real low point. They would come close to this edge later with "Talk", but "Drama" makes one nostalgic for Patrick Moraz, the George Lazenby of progressive keyboard players. Give Downes and Horn credit for knowing when to leave.
