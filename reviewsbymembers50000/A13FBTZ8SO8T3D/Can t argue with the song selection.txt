 ... but, essentially this is the third retread of the same canon - Live at The Fillmore, Acoustic en vivos, and now this. It's a slightly better compilation than the other two, but, the wolves have a bit of Costello-itis: retread the same stuff ad nauseum. It doesn't sound particularly remastered. I, for one, wish they would release some of the really amazing sets I have heard from them (The Fillmore doesn't make the cut). For example, their set at the Philadelphia Folk Festival some years back was maybe the best 45 minutes of live music I have ever heard, and closed with an incendiary take on Neil Young's "Cowgirl In the Sand," over the protestations of the numb-skull mc of that festival. I'm sure you would find it interesting hearing an audience boo a moron who was intruding off the stage - it just leant an extra edge to the whole set. Best part was they wound it up with a segue into "Cinnamon Girl" that exceeded their alotted time considerably. It's great to see control freaks swallow their tongues and reenforces the delicious subversiveness that rock can foster. None of that is on offer here. Still, if you have not purchased either of the last two live discs, then skip them and buy this, and hope that if LL can't figure out what to do next, perhaps they'll mine their live catalogue for some remarkable shows.
