 Young runs hot and cold and during this epoch of his life, the tremendous challenges confronting him as a father of 2 children afflicted with debilitating illness had him preoccupied with their care. As a result, what most people, including his record company never knew, was that experiments like TRANS were meant to be a sort of working out of some technologies that might help his sons become more integrated into the world and give them an active way of participating in it. The technologies here also were part of Young's fascination and involvement in Lionel trains. Does this make for good music? Not really. But this stuff came off better in concert than it did on CD. Sophisticated technical stuff is definitely overkill with Young in general, and some of the most humourous aspects of the biography SHAKEY, involve ol' Burnout obsessing over digital recording and so on. Young and the Horse are a one trick pony. It's a trick that is terrific when it has the spook, and a total mess otherwise. The bio paints this tour in particular as being a disaster of epic proportions that nearly had the stumble-bum musicians, especially Bruce Palmer, at each other's throats.  Nonetheless, by the looks of it here they actually managed to pull off a decent show from time to time. This video offers the NY fan a chance to evaluate the Trans period from the vantage point of Young's strengths: live performance. The star of the show is really Nils Lofgren, the diminutive guitarist from DC who resides now in the E Street Supper Club. There was a time in his career though where he brought out the best in Young, and for this show he is absolutely at the top of his game. Palmer has no idea he is in Europe, and the rest of the band is along for the ride, likely hoping like hell there is any money left at the end. It's real innarestin, as the man himself might put it.....
