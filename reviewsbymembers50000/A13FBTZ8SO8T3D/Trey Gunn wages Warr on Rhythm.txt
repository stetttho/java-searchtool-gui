 Gunn & Co have released a live document of their recent tour and the band features Gunn on 10 string, Mendelsone on 8 string Warr guitar, as well as Tony Geballe on electric and 12 string acoustic guitar, and drums. This is all rhythm and intricate time signatures executed with extraordinary precision. It put me in mind of Thelonius Monk's "Brilliant Corners", not for the sound of the music, but its sheer brilliant dynamics. While the shadow of Fripp and the New Standard Tuning school of guitarcraft hangs heavy in the air, particularly in the hands of both Gunn & Geballe, the results push that approach to the craft in new directions. There are hints of the post-gamelan style of the double trio and double-duo line up of the mighty Crim, there are suggestions of Soundscapes, and there are whole new worlds opened up by this band. This is not swing, blues or dance music (Rick Wakemen's observations notwithstanding). Yet, it is entirely captivating. Well worth a very careful listen and sure to inspire and confound every one playing guitar. Once upon a time, the question was posed whether the Greater Crim could survive Frippless. In Trey Gunn, the venal leader has a worthy successor for the Court.
