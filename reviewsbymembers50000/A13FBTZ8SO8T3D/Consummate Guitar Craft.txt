 Robert Fripp, take note, this is as consummate a devotion to playing guitar as has ever been undertaken. Howe's dexterity in the service of Yes has carried that troop for decades, but it is the occasional glimpse one had of his accoustic adventures that augured well for this release. And it's an absolute killer. This is a tour de force by a master of his instrument who firmly believes in both melody and technique. "To Be Over" is the highlight for me, emotionally. It is a wonderful recasting of what seemed at the time a coda for YES. Reset here, it has matured with age, or maybe I have. Deeply reflective, it is a very moving piece. Throughout this disc, you'll find yourself stunned by the power of his playing, the subtlety, the turns and twists in the compositions. This is extraordinary.  Howe's work here will inspire you. Your initial reaction may be to give up any hope of mastering the guitar, but as you continue to listen, this is the musical equivalent of a very long sojourn with Thich Nhat Hanh. You'll come out of the listening experience prepared to put your heart and soul into the playing. Howe will long be remembered for this wonderful record.
