 It all comes down to this: it's positively great to hear from Patti Smith again and she is definitely on fire throughout this disc. If you're a fan, you'll love it, if you are new to her, all her strengths are on display. By sheer accident of the time of their emergence, Smith is often mentioned in a similar breaths with Springsteen. Pity, as she's got a lot more to say with a great deal more conviction than the lovesick car mechanic from the Jersey shore.  But while we are on analogies, there is that undeniable chemistry that Smith has with her band that is as on the money as Springsteen with E Street, Young with Crazy Horse, Hound Dog Taylor and the Housebreakers: rarely would you consider them the best at their craft, but jeez o man the sparks fly. A bit of editing would have helped both "Gandhi" and "Radio Baghdad", but she has quite a point to make with both songs, and whether you ascribe to her values are not, she delivers them with such a commitment and intelligence that they deserve consideration. I'd have like to hear her include her take on the Declaration of Independence from her recent show in Philly. It was a show stopping political screed that burned with a firem and roused the choir to its feet in an otherwise pious Quaker schooled crowd. Smith grabs you by the short hairs and you gotta sit up and listen. Anyway, the Cd as delivered here is magnificent. "My Blakean Year" stands as one of her best compositions. "Cartwheels", "Peaceable Kingdom" and "Trampin" you'll return to often. Let's hope that not so much time goes by to her next effort, and perhaps she'll tour some more as well. She is what the times need.
