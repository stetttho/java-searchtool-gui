 Although in his liner notes Martin Carthy seeks to discount his family's reverential status in the folk-roots world, nonetheless, the Carthy and Waterson clans have not just preserved a rich and full tradition, but have also seriuosly advanced its beauty, its power, its sublime grace and drama, and for that deserve praise indeed, even if at times a bit overboard. This is the third outing from this trio and stands as remarkably incandescent as its predecessors. All of the hallmarks associated with their names are present in spades here. Carthy's percussive guitar work, Lisa's sensual fiddle lines, Waterson's earthy and warm and full blooded delivery are accompanied on this outing by Tim Van Eyck's melodeon and arrangements that at times blow straight from the working fields or high seas to the heart of the listener. Again, in his notes, Carthy graciously acknowledges the sources of the songs on this release, but it is what they do with them that is the core of the wonder they bring to the material. Perhaps nowhere is this more true than with Norma Waterson. Her way of getting inside the character of a song is utterly devastating, and frankly, as good as the recordings are, they pale in comparison to her live delivery. If ever there was a band deserving of DVD Audio only relases it is this ensemble. So be the songs whaling adventures or material from Packie Byrne or traditions handed down from the Copper Family, you'll find in this disc an extraordinary statement of the wealth and treasures to be found in English song. Waterson:Carthy are a family to be reckoned with. They've done their culture and the art of song great service. Long may they sing and play and grace our lives with drama, beauty and passion.
