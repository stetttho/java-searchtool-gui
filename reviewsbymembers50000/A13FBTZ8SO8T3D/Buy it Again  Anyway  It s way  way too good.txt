 No one should need to have the importance of this disc explained to them and from a sonic standpoint, the quality here is from the same remastered and restored tapes that produced the Miles/Trane box. What takes this elsewhere are the extra tracks from the recording sessions, and they are each terrific, and the second bonus disc with a live date of Miles with Monk delivering an absolutely mystical "Round Midnight," plus a concert from Pasadena California with the Trane quintet.  Regarding the Monk selection, the way that each man inspired the other is perhaps nowhere near so claerly evident as on this track. By itself, it would justify the price. Following with the never before released concert from Pasadena makes the second disc worth releasing on its own merits. The goof-ball MC sounds like such a cornball in his intro to Davis and his band, that you will find yourself squirming in humour. Imagine Jack Benny introducing P Diddy. Actually...... well, anyway, the band kicks in and there is an undeniable energy that they bring to the audience. Hopefully, as is the case with Hendrix, there are lodas of concert tapes from this quintet as well asmany of the other formations Miles put together. Miles was a live player. The studio records were phenomenal, but he knew the dialectics of live performance better than any jazz artist before or after him. replace your other copies of this essential document. What you are familiar with will delight you, and the new stuff will astound you.
