 Both this one and the other BC disc dealing with alleged "ghost voices" are late night fodder for radio programs such as John Di Liberto's stuff on "Stars End". For all of Wilson's compelling work in Porcupine Tree, these releases and the No Man discs are strictly vanity projects for the completists. They certainly don't have the tension and release of the best of Eno's stuff or from other projects like Channel Light Vessel.  There's nothing really wrong with this stuff, but having stopped smoking pot 25 years ago, I tend to be less impressed. However, were I to be suffering through an interminable night of insomnia, I'd slap this baby right into the disc player, pick up some Willard Quine and I'm sure happy land would follow. The selling point here, however, are the Fripp samples - that ascending sustain that is Fripp's trademark resounds at peak moments, as it always has, to raise the emotional investment in this music. I feel as though I could likely guess from whence these ascensions were sampled, but if you are familiar with anything like what he did on the Roches' "Losing True", you'll have the idea. Worth purchasing? That's up to you. I'm heading back to sleep.
