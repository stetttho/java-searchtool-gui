 You have to concede that interest in Bic is definitely in the order of guilty pleasures. The songs are simple enough, and supeficially not that commanding, none the less there is something about them that gets you to listen to this CD all the way through every time. It's her voice and delivery. She sings as though she has just finished or is about to make love to you like no one else in the world, and that directly passionate sensuality, a kind of Kiwi Norah Jones, or a previous generation's Peggy Lee, relives Bic of the need to string complex sentences together like Elvis Costello. I could do with a lot less of EC's precious vocabulary and a lot more of evoking what burns in the heart, the soul, the naughty parts. Bic can handle herself instrumentally as well as anybody out there. Yet it has none of the obviously layered approach of Enya. I simply happened to have stumbled upon her in concert in NZ, and I got blown away by how HOT she is. This girl smolders. Several cold showers after her concert, I found what remained my dignity. But in the course of the show, I'd have followed her anywhere. Prince and Steven Tyler have always struck me as wanks who can't give it a rest. Bic runga oozes a sexuality that seems to carry a depth to it that would suggest you'll never be the same thereafter. The music herein is filled with that underlying and unresolved tension. Lennon/McCartney she ain't, but no matter, put this on and you'll be hard pressed to walk away unaffected.
