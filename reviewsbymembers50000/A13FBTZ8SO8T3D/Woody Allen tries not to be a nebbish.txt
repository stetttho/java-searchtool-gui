 ... but Brit accents instead of certain zipcodes of Manhattan do not rescue him. This is the same set of neuroses that Allen's been mining forever, more recently without a sense of humour. Essentially, if you thought the Johansen/Bill Murray Sleepless in Tokyo type of film was profound, you'll love this. I didn't see a return to form only because I can barely tell one film from the next after Zelig.  You'll immediately notice that Martin Balsam, Tony Roberts and whoever is working NY Theatre these days are not in the film, but that's it - the differences are superficial. Wealthy, privileged, over indulged Londoners are subbing for the same mob out of NYC. It's not that there are any Brit versions of Allen in the film, it's just the same story, one more time. Ingmar Bergman manages this better as he seems to find with each film yet another unique reason to despair - he can't help it, he's Swedish. Allen circles the airport on the vagaries of love and betrayal, but it comes across as an incessant whine stretched over 15 years of movies. I can not imagine a WA film festival - it would remind me of a scene from Annie Hall.  In that regard he has turned into a parody of himself. This particular parody is better than any of the last 7 or 8 films, but it's nothing you haven't seen before, just different streets, different accents, same cloying and annoying characters who have no right to complain about anything. I've often looked at the people in Allen's films and found myself recalling Oscar Wilde's quip that money was wasted on the wealthy.
