 For starters, let me just say that I find Martin extremely overated - he hasn't made me laugh since the Smothers Brothers. Even with that bias, I was astounded at just how stupidly awful this film is. Martin trucks in the same swill as Woody Allen, so you have the impression that it's always the same shtick with him. The French accent isn't funny, the pratfalls have been done better by everyone from Chevy Chase thru Gerry Ford to Peter Sellers and Dick Van Dyke. This was a movie that never needed to be made - it is a vanity project for Martin (someone please tell him he aint Peter Sellars).  The sight gags are telegraphed way ahead, the malaprops are expected, in short there is nothing here that will catch your funny bone surprised. If you have an insatiabl;e need to hear the familiar, and then have the familiar repeated, this is the film for you. For anyone else who got a tickle out of the originals (which, honestly were not THAT funny, Kato notwithstanding - even Peter thought them banal), you're going to be grossly (and I mean that) disappointed. Begnini did a much better homage in his son of PP, than this Martin infatuated "prequel", whatever that is.
