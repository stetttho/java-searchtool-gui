 Not just for fans, but for anyone interested in guitarcraft, songcraft, performance art, this is a remarkable testament, that in Canada established categorically that Cockburn was a major, major writer, at least as significant as Young, Lightfoot or Mitchell, and soon to prove to be one of the most planetary writers, period. Everything about this disc is a joy. He is in great form, his accompaniests, particulalrly Rob Boucher are amazing, and his material sets a centuries broad comprhensiveness later emulated by Richard Thompson. Frankly, I wait in ecited anticipation for the Remaster in the current Rounder series, hoping there may be even more material to round out 2 discs. The concerts from this period were just captivating!
