 Help! I need a writer Help! Not just any writer Help! You know I need my band! Apart from the lovely sentiments of the title track, this like most of Lennon's solo stuff is part screed against McCartney, part paean to the Wicked Witch of the East, part airing of his psychological laundry. Not a pretty site. As music, it's mostly amateurish muck.  Funny that someone so pedastalled for hist artiste-te-te-te-te sensibilities can't seem to let it be and get past the fact that his former partner during this same period bore him no ill will (inspite of the protagonist's efforts to financially undermine him), that his former partner could and would begin another career quite successfully financially and artistically without him (in fact consistently for the next three decades). I mean really, if "Yesterday" was "the only thing you did", Lennon should have been so limited. As to the lovestruck anthems to Yoko, well, beauty is in the .... whatever. I find it hard to listen to these tunes without gagging.Lennon was a mess during this period and scowling, wearing leather, remaining obdurately obtuse are all no excuse for not practicing his craft as a writer. His personal pecadilloes would only escalate over the next 4 years and it wouldn't be until "Starting Over" that he actually would seem to have rediscovered how to write a song. The blind devotion he inspires I never quite got. The other three all managed more interesting solo records. Still in all, this is a marked improvement over his first piece of crap, and would be, outside of his brilliant rendition of early rock songs, the best of his oeuvre. Imagine that.
