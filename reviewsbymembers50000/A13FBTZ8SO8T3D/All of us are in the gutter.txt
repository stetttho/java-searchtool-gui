 .... but some of us are looking at the stars. When I first picked this up, 7 years ago, I was stunned and driven to tears by the beauty of the music herein. I have never heard a CD that has impacted me as deeply as this, and I was not really that aware of Evans, other than as the piano player on KIND OF BLUE. THIS CHANGED ALL THAT. What happened here was that I came face to face with a man who knew that his life was ending and the urgency in his playing was driven by his desire to make some lasting enduring statement about Music and what Truths lie therein before fate came to turn out the stars. You don't need me to validate his playing. Evans was one of a kind and a soul of powerful emotions. Often called impressionistic, Evans was really more exitentialistic: there is an urgency at every moment to live and to play authentically. I can see what Miles saw in him: it wasn't what he played, but what was in the silence that his beautiful music framed. This set is absolutely loaded with such moments. Oscar Wilde made the comment with which I opened this note. Oscar also observed that "All men kill the things they loved." Should you ever read Bill's biography, you'll understand how that aphorism applies with tragic tenderness to Bill Evans. I can think of no greater loss to music than his passing. This set presents the mments just before his star went supernova. It is the most brilliant box set I have ever heard.
