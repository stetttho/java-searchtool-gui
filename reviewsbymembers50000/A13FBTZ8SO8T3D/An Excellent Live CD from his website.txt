 As Vanarndt from allentown, nj states, this is the commercial in-store release of a terrific document that has been previously available through his website. If you have it already, do not be mislead into thinking this is new. However, Jackson is preparing other live and studio releases for this year to celebrate his 25 years being ignored by the pop mind-set. Pity, because he is far more compelling and convincing a writer than Elvis Costello, a 100% more genuine and a thousand times less full of himself than the Liverpudlian windbag.  There is an autheticity to Joe that is far removed from the smug calculated preciousness of MacManus. Joe never lost his punk vitriol, no matter how skilfully he embraced it in music. And he never had the delusional self absorption to dismiss and deride Ray Charles's contributions. There is always an edge to Jackson, even in in the sentimental "Home Town", which strikes a resonating chord with anyone who sees something essentially lost in their place of remembered beauty. This set sparkles all the way through, and though taken from different concerts in different cities, it is a seamless and intimate presentation of some of his most terrific songs. There is everything to like about this set, so, if you hadn't picked it up before, do yourself a favour and do so  now.
