 Dealing with the mythology was always a formidable strongpoint for Steve Hackett. That he is one of the finest nylon string guitar players in the world only enhances the wonder, the lyricism and the sophistication of his tales. He is not a singer by any means, but it's his hands that tell the story. "Blood On The Rooftops" from the Genesis days is just one of the many extraordinary examples of the sophistication he brought to rock, invoking the legend of Passover into the backdrop of American TV violence and the Israeli-Palestinian cross-fire. On this latest disc, moving away from social commentary, Shakespeare and back into Greek mythology, Hackett along with his cadres have created a classical masterpiece. The integration of the instruments is subtle. The pacing of the tale is dead-on. His fingerpicking and plectrum work set him apart from both classical and rock contemporaries. I can think of only Steve Howe, with whom he shared an entirely unsuccessful collaboration that played to none of their strengths (GTR), and Sharon Isbin, I can think of no other contemporary guitarist with that capacity for storytelling as well as finesse. Hackett must surely channel John Dowland, both thematically and stylistically. It is a chamber work on offer here, more baroque than classical, but it is one of the ways in which ancient myth informs us of the perils of our particular age. This is a significant addition to the canon of guitar music.
