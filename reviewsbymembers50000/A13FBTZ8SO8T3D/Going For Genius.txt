 More or less pronounced dead after RELAYER, this release caught everyone by surprise, and re-cast YES in a very avant mode. THe compositions are absolutely terrific. Wakeman was back on board after a slew of ridiculously themed victorian disasters, and played as though he had better resurrect his career, which he did momentarily. Anderson, Howe and Squire were writing with a commitment that had not been this razor sharp since the YES ALBUM. The songs had an urgency, yet could also re-create a sense of magic. "Wonderous Stories," "Turn of the Century", "Awaken" were positively and emotionally stunning. "Going For The One" re-set the game board altogether for YES and has served them well as an indication of just how protean a force they were. The only downside to this was the element of having recorded much of this separately, leaving it to their producer, Eddie Offord, to fashion this into the marvel that it became. The remastering serves as much to validate Offord's remarkable contributions as it does to resuscitate the YES career, much like MAGNIFICATION would do 20 years later. The extras here contain one gem, and one bogie, 2 runthroughs. "Vevey" is worthy of inclusion, "Amazing Grace" does not need Chris Squire to air it out; in fact, it would be best if no one played it for a good century,especially anybody Scottish. It is as hackneyed as "Danny Boy." Perhaps the remastering folks will embrace a less is more approach with the remaining catalogue. All the same, another terrifc job on the remastering: just remarkable how very, very good this great disc sounds.
