 .... for those of you, who, like myself, never got the point of unfocused and undisciplined noodling for hours until the marijuana wears off. I suppose if you were a Deadhead you could quibble about a song or two, but I happened to have thought they were an OK band whose individuals tended to be greater than the sum of their parts. Kinda fitting for the Dead. All the same, this has a lot of really terrific songs that show just how well this band could tap into something quintessentially American and make it danceable. The remastering on this disc brings out the subtle joys of "Uncle John's Band", "Box of Rain," "Friend of the Devil." "Eminent Prophet" and "Sugar Magnolia" sound terrific, "Touch of Grey" however seems to have had a bad job done on it as the vocals seems quite muddy. This is an exercise in restraint, and so tends to show what the band could really do when focused. For those who feel that any of their tunes only got their mojo going when extended for 20 minutes, there are plenty of official bootlegs to satisfy that jones. Most of the rest of the tunes here never grabbed me, well maybe, "Ripple," and it's interesting what a marked departure Mickey Hart's presence on the drummer's chair meant for the band.
