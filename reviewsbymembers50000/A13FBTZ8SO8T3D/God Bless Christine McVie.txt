 This is Motown music for white people: same rockers, same ballads, same lyrics, same beat, guaranteed to convince Clinton era self-satisfied baby boomers that if they're wealthy all is right with the world. Hard to believe this band was once a well respected British Blues band in the early 70's. Of course back then, Eric Clapton hadn't turned into Perry Como, either. Anyway, that was long ago. Since the alignment with Buckingham and Nicks, this out fit went straight for the middle of the road. Along the way, Buckingham recycled ideas that were kinda cute first time through, entirely predictable 20 some years later. McVie lays down bass parts by memory, Fleetwood injects ideas that suggest there was something at the bottom of all this, and Nicks seems to have embraced the parodies of herself. Anyway, if images of Bill Clinton honking mediocre sax (and likely it was dubbed, given his penchant for inauthenticity) while FM paraded anthemic power chords over inane lyrics, make you weak with nostalgia, then this is for you. For anyone who welcomed punk's rebellion against the corporate formulaic bloated junk of the 70's, this will make you nostalgic for the vitriol of Johnny Rotten and Sid Viscious.  I've seriously insulted the friend who sat me down to listen to this by sticking a safety pin someplace private, but it's the only way I can deal with this garbage. Has a nice beat, though...... God Bless Christine McVie. She was the only thing about this band that had any articulate intelligence and she NEVER pandered her musical chops. As genuine an R & B singer as Steve Winwood, she had the decency to bail on this project with her integrity in tact.
