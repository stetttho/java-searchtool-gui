 There are some incredible renditions of this mammoth symphony, including Riccardo Chailly's recent take that is available in a wonderfully mastered DVD Audio version, but this one is even better. Having seen this symphony performed in the National Cathedral in DC back in the 70's, I have always been stunned by its spiritual power. What Rattle brings to this with his CBSO is a summing up of his cycle through Mahler, and he has saved his best for last. Not sure what Berlin will think of that, but perhaps it will give them an incredibly lofty goal. This recording emboldens the spirit and hits profoundly compelling spiritual moments at every turn. It is pristinely recorded, and I am sincerely hoping that there is DVD Audio or Blueray version in the works. It moves a little more briskly than other versions that I have, but that's a great thing altogether. It gives the entire symphony an exhilaration such as I have never heard before. This is an essential disc for classical and Mahler fans.
