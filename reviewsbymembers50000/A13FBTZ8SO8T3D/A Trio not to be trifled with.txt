 USA is a document of the final phase of the first partnership Fripp engaged in with Bill Bruford. There was a chemistry there, often volatile, that would prove the catalyst for the next 25 years in the life of King Crimson. At this point, what had started as a quintet with Jamie Muir and David Cross deconstructed to a power quartet of Bruford, John Wetton and Fripp, and the operative word is POWER. There is no mistaking how formidable a bass player Wetton was and he certainly reset the thinking of a vocalist for King Crimson. Virtually no one but Adrian Belew could possibly hope to follow him at the mic. In any case, I would highly recommend this CD. The live versions of their studio and the improvisations on which they embark ask and offer no quarter. These were extraordinarily volatile days in the inner dynamics of the King and that played out with a ruthless fury, especially in the improvs. You're not likely to hear members of a band dare, taunt, and threaten each other musically as bravely as these men did. The result was that, even when the volleys missed their targets or came crashing down in flames, the exhilaration and rush of blood through the veins and the ennervation of the nerves thoroughly rinses you out.  At the conclusion of this tour, David Cross bid his bandmates farewell. He sought a more spiritual direction in his life, and certainly something of a different stripe than what he experienced in Crimson. In the course of this CD , he is overwhlemed. He battles on regardless, but it is quite clear that the elctric violin and the finesse it brought to the treatments of the songs here was clearly caught in the cross-fire of the other three musicians. This is very exciting listening and I would not pass this CD up. Many thanks to the DGM team for restoring the tapes and bringing this document back to life.
