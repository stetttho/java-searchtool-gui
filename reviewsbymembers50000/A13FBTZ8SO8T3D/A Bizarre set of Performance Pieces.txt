 This release has not grown on me the way ALICE has. The music is Waits at his absolute weirdest, and that's saying something. Likely that's enough to attract legions of fans. Truth to tell, these songs have not stayed with me as ALICE's compositions have. I find myself fast forwarding or skipping through pieces like "Calliope", and thematically, the whole project just comes off as soundtrack music for Charles Bukowski nightmares. A worthy project, but certainly niche music for art students. Again, the music is meant to accompany some sort of theatrical piece by Robert Wilson. Maybe in context, this would rivet me more, but on its own, a couple of times through this now over the course of the past year and I doubt that I'll listen to it again.
