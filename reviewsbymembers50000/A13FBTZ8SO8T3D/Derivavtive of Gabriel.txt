 The best thing about LAST TEMPTATION was Peter Gabriel's score. Turns out it is the best thing about this film as well. I'm not sure how Gibson copped a songwriting credit, but the whole thing is a Hollywoodization of the textures assembled by Gabriel. Is it good? Yeah. But I already own PASSION. So, it would be nice if the 2 guys claiming credit for this music would at least acknowledge that, perhaps, like George Harrison, they did not really know they were lifting music wholecloth.
