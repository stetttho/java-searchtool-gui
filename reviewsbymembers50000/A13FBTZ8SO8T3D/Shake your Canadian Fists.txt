 This is a significant improvement over the mediocre UXO release. The music herein moves with a compelling direction and there is an internal logic to what's on offer here that sets them apart from their own work as well as others like Explosions In The Sky and the knob-obsessed Pelican.  Throughout the progress of the tracks on each disc there is an intriguing blend of instrumentation, each passage rising organically from foundations laid as the music progresses. I haven't heard this sophisticated a stream of musical consciouness since the Topographic days of YES. While not as overtly Stravinsky-based as Anderson and Co, these Canadians have that sense of working on a much bigger canvas with an incredible array of colours on their palette. All of it works. I found myself surprised when each disc ended. That in itself is a significant improvement over UXO. Hopefully they shall survive as a working team. Who knows what recognition in GOURMET magazine will do to them. An odd karmic twist for a band that disdains its own success and the retailing efforts to which it must concede. With this release they establish themselves as having quite a lot to say musically in the dialogues among each other, and I'm hoping that discussion continues.
