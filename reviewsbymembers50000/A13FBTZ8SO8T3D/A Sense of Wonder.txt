 Having attended the world premier of the Eighth Symphony in Philadelphia in 2001, I was looking forward to and hoping that Ondine would tackle the recording with another Orchestra for a couple of reasons: the acoustics of the Academy of Music did not bring out the subtleties in the work and in point of fact, the horns flubbed the ending of the second movement. I was somewhat startled, but in fact, it seemed like one of the horn players lost his breath.  I happen to enjoy Rautavaara's music enormously, and this recording is a wonder.Perhaps it is the cultural affinity that the Helsinki Philarmonic shares with Rautavaara (Philadelphia long being known as a German & Italian influenced ensemble, especially since the days of Muti), perhaps it is my own northern heritage, but whatever the reason, Leif Segerstam and the orchestra have gotten inside the music and the mystery, that sense of wonder that fills my imagination when I listen to this composer.  The disc opens with a concerto for harp and orchestra and it is a piece that seems to hang in the air, a bit as though it were a display of the northern lights in that eternal Scandinavian twilight. It seems to lay the perfect ground for the 8th to begin. Appropriately entitled "The Journey", and often referred to by the composer as evocative of his thoughts on the road thus far, it is one of his most compelling pieces. Not as dramatic as some of the various "Angel" compositions, it nonetheless has that same sense of looking back over the landscape. In Tom Waits' terms, "it ain't the years, it's the mileage;" Rautavaara has seemed to pull together the thematic inspiration of a long and wonderfully crafted career to sum up where he is in order to refocus his gaze toward the future. Whether there is a number 9 in the works or some other expression of his soul, and this is indeed soul music, at this moment we have cause to examine the night sky and contenplate what a journey each of us has traversed.
