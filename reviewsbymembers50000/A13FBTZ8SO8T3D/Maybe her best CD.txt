 Pity she stopped singing professionally, because as this disc so clearly demonstrates, O'Connor is one of the most powerful voices in music. This is a collection of appearances she made on other CDs and while they tend to be largely techno or world-dub with very heavy bass, once O'Connor rises up out of the mix, the songs themselves take on an incredible viatlity that is compelling, dramatic, essential. These are great tunes, whether Sinead is working out with Asian Dub Foundation, Afro-Celts, U2, Edge, Aslan. Some of the songs you'd be familiar with. I was less aware of most of the material on this disc. Along with I DO NOT WANT, I think this is her best CD.  Equally impressive is that her command of the material doesn't overwhelm it. Sinead knew what the song needed to get the heart pumping and the soul soaring and she hits it each time out. The Peter Gabriel selection was perhaps her most infamous, pressaging as it did her meltdown, but set in the contexts of these other songs, you see what an incredible contribution she made to Gabriel.  I hope she reconsiders her career, as there were just so many great things about it. Not easy though. It was not lost on me that O'Connor's new disc should arrive just after the Legacy Edition of Janis Joplin's PEARL. Not since Janis has there been a singer of such command as O'Connor, not withstanding Lennox, Hynde, laing or Emmylou. Maybe you get too close to the edge. In which case if Sinead has stuff in the vaults, that would be enough. For now, this is an incredible coda to an incendiary signer's career.
