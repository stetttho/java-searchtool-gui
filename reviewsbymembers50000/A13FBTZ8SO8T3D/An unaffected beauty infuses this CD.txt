 What a striking CD this is! It is easy to stand in awe of De Lucia when you listen to him with Al De Meola, but until you get down to him in his own element, flamenco, you just don't appreciate what a compelling and passionate musicians he is. This is not a set of fireworks, but more the smoldering  intensely passionate burning of a heart and soul dedicated to a sublime expression of the human heart. Acoompanied simply by the handclapping palmas and the singing of a small chorus, this is an intimate recording, not a big production showcase, and thus comes its seductive allure. Images of women dancing flamenco will whirl through your imagination. intercut with reflections on Spain's Sephardic and Moorish cultural vestiges. Soul music of the most sublime order! Throughout it is as though you do not even notice the craft and skill of De Lucia's fretwork, fingering and plectum; yet, in the end he has nourished your soul in ways you were unprepared for and unaware of.  If you are an afficianado of flamenco, I can't imagine that you will find a finer exposition than this CD. If you have an avocation for world music, this is a master expressing himself with such power and grace that you must pick this up.
