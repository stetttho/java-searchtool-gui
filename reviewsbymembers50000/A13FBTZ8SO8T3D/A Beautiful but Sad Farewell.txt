 Tragedy befell this band in spades, and as the life expectancy of this group wound down, they somehow found what it took to create a beautiful, if sad farewell. The eagle that flew had a certain life force for them, and when you think how soon after this Chris Wood was gone, it is a bit heartbreaking. But Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, Chris Wood were in absolutely brilliant form for this. "Dream Gerrard" and the title track are songs for the ages. By this time, Winwood and Capaldi were really becoming adept in the studio, and you'll find a load of sonic gems throughout this remastered disc. This is nearly essential if you are a Winwood fan, and absolutely so if Traffic inspired you. This was their Abbey Road.
