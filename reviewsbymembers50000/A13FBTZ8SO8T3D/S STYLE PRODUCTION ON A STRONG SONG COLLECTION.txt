 It's funny, but as the world marches toward war once again, this title is remastered with a sense of immediacy that warrants reflection. At this point in his life, Cockburn had undergone a number of changes, including the dissolution of his marriage. He moved to Toronto and assembled a brilliant cadre of top flight musicians, hit the road, recorded and moved generally from mystic to engaged. All the songs here, be it the cityscapes of "Pay Your Money" or "Coldest Night", the political observations of "Strong One" and "Justice", or the merry atmosphere of "Radio Shoes" and "Walking" reveal how he moved on.  The remastering job on this brings out great pleasures in the guitarwork. This was a particularly hot band live, and perhaps some vault stuff will emerge to document the liberties Bruce took with his material. Kathryn Moses was a great on-stage foil for him, vocally and musically. Hugh Marsh on fiddle was a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, "Strong One" as a studio cut packs none of the punch that it did live, and that's likely due to the addition of Fergus Jamison Marsh on stick. Nonetheless, this is powerful stuff. It would get more so with time. The 2 extra cuts are genius. There is some kind of 80's effect on the drums that dates the recording, but it is made up for by the clarity on the guitars from the remastering. Altogether, another gem.
