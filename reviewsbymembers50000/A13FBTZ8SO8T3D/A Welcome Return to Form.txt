 Inspite of the horrible make up job and dismal photography, Natalie has clearly gotten past the Dixie Chic infatuation she flirted with for the past few years. No doubt, having Tracy dares back on board at the piano has enabled her to focus her considerable strengths and energy in delivering exciting interpretations of the Cape Breton cannon. Natalie has pedigree genes for this sort of thing, and the presence of Fleck, Wooten, Brown and Meyer all add to the Cape Breton direction instead of veering it off into Nashville Nucklehead music. The only clunker in the pack is the dopey "Master's Hand," a bit of Chrsitian inspired cornball that is perhaps cute in concert, but totally dismissable here. It's not the cut you'll ever return to. The essentail thing, though, is the chemistry between Dares and Mac Master. they grew up together, they hit the road together and there is a dialectic between these two women that brings out Mac Master's best qualities. If you ever caught them in the mid 90's, you know theirs was an incredible partnership, and the evidence that it still is inspiring is all through this disc. If you are a fan of Mac Master, or Dares for that matter, this is absoluetly essential listening. Well done!
