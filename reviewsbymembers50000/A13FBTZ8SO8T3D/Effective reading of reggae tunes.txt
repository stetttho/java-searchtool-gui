 O Connor has a point - she'd like to see God freed from the confines of religion. Heady argument, that. She's probably capable of an articulate argument in that regard as well, but she'll need to lose the nutter image, which hews to her like a shadow. She shadow boxes with that image in this collection of well wrought and authentically produced standards from the reggae canon. Among the reviewers there are often references to SEAN NOS NUA,  her somewhat Irish traditonal CD. It's a valid reference, as O Connor delivers soulful, measured readings of these tunes, accompanied by REAL JAMAICANS! in the band and on the knobs in the control room. I'm not exactly reaching for a blunt at the moment, but I still felt about as close to Kingston as I'll ever likely get in listening to this disc. It has a certain "safeness" to it, that while well-wrought, still conveys the impression that O Connor has not fully stuck her head out her tortoise shell. In short, it's a very good effort. I'm just waiting for the more dangerous side of O Connor to cut loose again.
