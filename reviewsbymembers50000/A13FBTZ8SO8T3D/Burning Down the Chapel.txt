 David Byrne is amazing and this DVD is every bit as nuanced and inventive and humourous and fun as STOP MAKING SENSE. It hasn't the manic over the top energy of the TH film, but it is just as brilliant a concert. Byrne is in spectacular form and after so many years of wandering about in wherever he was wandering about, this tour presents him with his vision fully formed and heading in exciting directions. The instrumentation is more stripped down than in SMS, but old chestnuts from his previous life as well as new songs from his most recent disc are each delivered with passion and commitment. This must have been an extraordinary experience. Even on DVD, it is hard to resist the urge to dance hurky-jerky with the Pinnochio of Rock. His limbs are as limber as ever and his oddness has all the same endearing elements to it as he has ever had, and now with the years registered in his grey hair and his wisdom infused with time, his observations pack a poignancy you don't get from many another. I really can't pick out a highlight. Maybe "Naive Melody", which carries all the same emotional honesty now as it ever has. In so many ways, he is "the same as he ever was," only with the grace of time deepening his shadow. Union Chapel looks terrific in the film. The setting is beyond perfect for Byrne. Production quality is of the highest calibre. You would expect nothing less from him. From "Nothing But Flowers" through to the encore, this is a categorcial triumph as a film, as music, as an emotional sojourn. Great stuff. Hope you pick this up and enjoy it.
