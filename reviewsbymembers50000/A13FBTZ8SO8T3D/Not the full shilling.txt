 In all honesty, there is an excitement to these initial appearances that redefined everything about music, and for that reason, they are terrific. It is just amazing how charming The Beatles are, and what polished professionals they were at this point in their lives. REM still isn't there, and U2 remain pretenders. However, there is also a lot more to their relationship with Ed than is present here and it's a pity such things as sound checks and backstage footage, of which there is plenty, wasn't culled for this. senor Wences is a poor substitute. More importantly, the post touring videos that The Beatles distributed to Ed first, and through him to the rest of the world are not part of this. I think this sells the story short. The Beatles and Ed Sullivan created MTV with the films and performances of their post 66 songs. These short films were often accompanied with the kind of banter that was the Liverpudlian stock in trade, and was so essential to their winning people over, be it from Lennon's classic verbal jousting with Morcombe and Wise, to their goofing with Ed who might not always get what they were on about. Pity something could not have been worked out with APPLE and the lads so that some of this could be re-lived. Essentially, The Beatles were also rare in the way they refused to believe the hysteria was worth regarding. Totally ego-less, especially for rock performers, they never lost touch with who they were, and that may stand, along with their music, as quite an incredible acheivement. They were the genuine article. In fact,they were the last genuine article. More away from the spotlight in the Ed Sullivan theatre might have been extraordinarily welcome.
