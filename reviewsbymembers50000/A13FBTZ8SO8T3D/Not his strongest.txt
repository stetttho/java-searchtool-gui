 ... but this Cd still had its strengths. It is more in line with his folk-rock Byrds legacy, but there is a sense in these recordings that McGuinn was tiring of that shackle. This record brought some attention to and made a momentary star out of Dan Fogelberg, who embodied that southern california brain dead style embraced by everyone from Gram Parsons through the Burritos and Eagles and Poco and L&M. It's not like we needed another one. Still, McGuinn and Levy were generating strong material, most notably "Gates of Horn", a tribute to the club in Chicago where McGuinn got it going. This and THUNDERBYRD were not the strongest of his efforts, but like Harrison's weaker moments, still pack plenty to recommend them. I would steer you to CRADIFF ROSE, McGUINN AND BAND and the eponymous first disc. His recent projects are also terrific, and bear serious consideration of a tradition that would not have survived without Roger McGuinn.
