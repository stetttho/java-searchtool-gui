 Lang Lang's previous recordings have struck me as overtly showey in an almost Vegas way, and having seen him, I found some of the gyrations hammy. Thus, while he can no doubt play the piano, I haven't been as awe-struck as the NY crowd willing to throw themselves at his feet. Of course, Ny is where Bernstein made his home, and that was all about ham.  There is thus less of the Liberace element to this recording, and that is due to Gergiev's tighter control on phrasing and pacing. The propensity for excess is economized and in the process, Lang has delivere an emotionally beautiful CD. Lang's phrasing is somewhat slower than other renditions that I have heard, but it is also for that reason more contemplative. The familiar melodies are there, but turned just enough to offer a reconsideration. The recording is warm and intimate. gergiev is a master at accentuating the subtle passages in music, and this is as much a triumph for him as it is for Lang, quite amazing given what a party-piece this tends to be. I'd like to see Lang move beyond the cliches and tackle something else altogether. That may not fit in with his programming, but it would be a major step forward in seeing what fires his soul.
