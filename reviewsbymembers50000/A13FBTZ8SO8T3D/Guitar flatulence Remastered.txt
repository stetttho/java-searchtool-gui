 So do we really need to hear this? I guess if you are an Al Kooper fan, there is some merit, although, the Kooper kuts here were done better and more dramatically with BS&T. Bloomfield never impressed me much, so he has that NY Long Island playing style that worked in the Catskills, but came off as less than convincing outside that circuit. Stills? Please. What was the first side of this record was made stronger by virtue of the fact that Stills turned in a workmanlike effort. Sure, played hard, not much to show for it. I do suspect that this effort was the nascent arrival of an insufferable ego that would only undermine him as time wore on. Give credit to the remastering crew, though. You can hear pristinely how overwrought every note on this disc is. The 2002 remixes are a waste on top of something as thoroughly unnecessary as anything I've ever heard. Caveat emptor (that's let the buyer beware for all of you from LI).
