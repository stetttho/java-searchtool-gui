 Meant as an update and a reconsideration of the Court of the Crimson King once covered by FRAME BY FRAME, this 4 CD set recasts essential turning points in the catalogue of Crimson with insight and inspiration. Two CDs of studio based recordings and 2 CDs of live tracks document what a powerful, and remarkably cohesive process King Crimson has been. Having subscribed to the Collectors' Club from its inception I wasn't sure how much more revelatory another packaging would be, but the sources of these tracks and their sequencing shows how deeply committed the band members have been to the graeter Crim. Most amazingly to me is the constant revolution in my own regard for the Crim composed of Fripp, Collins, Wallace and Burrell, arguably one of the more maligned line-uos. Here in the live tracks they are every bit the measure of Wetton and Bruford, no mean feat. If you have an avocation for the King and his Prime Minister, you'll know the tracks well enough. If you are new to KC, well, this as fundamental a grounding in the course of their trajectory as you'll ever compress into 150+ minutes. There are some surprises included as well! For the enthusiast, the appetite is well wetted for the next epoch! A great holiday gift, an important document for anyone who loves this very odd Musicking, so a hearty thanks to all at DGM. Now, how about a DVD Audio release or a DVD box set to go with this?
