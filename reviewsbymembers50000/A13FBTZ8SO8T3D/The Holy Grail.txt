 Any questions?  Keep in mind that it was just after this recording, as John visited his mother and cousin back home in Philadelphia, that Miles reached back out, and what ensued was KIND OF BLUE.  Here, on the event horizon, Monk and Coltrane were already where no one else knew how to get to. Lovingly restored by son Ravi, this effort by John Coltrane in a supporting role, eclipses so much of every sax player whoever went before him that it must have been exceedingly difficult to leave Monk. That tells you all you need to know about the spiritual connection between Miles and Trane. Listen to this. This is the music that only God could inspire.
