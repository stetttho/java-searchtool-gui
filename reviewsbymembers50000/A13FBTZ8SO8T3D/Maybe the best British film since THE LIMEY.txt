 Among other issues that this film settles is who should be the next James Bond - Daniel Craig. Craig delivers, along with the rest of this superb cast, an outstandinglt taut performance of a drug dealer attempting to sift through the double, triple and multi-crosses in as fine and as nuanced and as exciting a crime film as I have ever seen. Supported by Colm Meaney and Michael Gambon, to name just two, plus the sultry Sienna Miller, fresh off boyfriend Jude Law's dalliance with the nanny, Craig is as riveting as Terrence Stamp in THE LIMEY  from a few years back. Quite honestly this film is as brilliantly conceived and executed as THE USUAL SUSPECTS, and with as surprising an ending as you'll see in any film this year. I have no idea what all else the DVD will include but the essential mystery of who Daniel Craig's character is will leave Kaiser Sukay fans wanting more.
