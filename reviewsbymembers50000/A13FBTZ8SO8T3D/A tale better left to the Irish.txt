 Ponderously academic (Aristotle's NICOMACEAN ETHICS reads faster) this Yankee take on the Romanian legend is OK at the beginning and then Dickensian in detail as it goes along, without Tiny Tim's creator's ability to breathe life in to all manner of Englishmen. Rather, like the subject himself, as it moves along it eventually and slowly sucks the life out of the tale.  Kostova has had the luxury of travelling nearly everywhere in Eastern Europe and I suspect she must have been paid by the word to describe each setting, culture and tableaux in exhausting detail. At times, it's really quite interesting until you have to remeber where the plot left off. Typical of an English lit major, I suppose. The criticisms that it deadens your interest are valid as are the praise for the command of her subject. But, unless you're Dickens or Pynchon or Eco, you're better off emulating Calvino, Trevor or Kerouac. Get on with it, sister, tell the story. I understand you went to college. So, it's a novel in dire need of a screenplay version, ideally written with Anthony Hopkins in mind. When Vlad does appear, he is not quite the Impaler he was in the 1400's, but that could work quite well were Hopkins given command to interpret a la his Lechter rolls a diabolical menace beneath the librarian, much the way undisclosed pedophiles lurk in the shadows, or serial killers fit so well into a community. But that isn't what is on offer here. If you have the summer to kill, you'll get through this and enjoy most of it. It just ain't all it's hyped up to be. Still, as always, the best version was that told by the gent from County Antrim, which you can still enjoy on face value or in its allegorical references to the social and political (have I mentioned Karl Rove yet) sycophants of our times.
