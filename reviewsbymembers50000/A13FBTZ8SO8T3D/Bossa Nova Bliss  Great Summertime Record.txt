 It must be in the genes. There is a great swing and summertime glide to this music that I find totally enchanting. As mystifyingly seductive as "The Girl From Ipanema," this CD finds daughter Bebel crafting an incredibly strong follow up to TANTO TEMPO. No sophomore jinx here. The musicians are terrific throughout, and while the lyrics are of no real substance, it is the mood they conjure, be it in Portugese or Bebel's take on English. I'd cut off my arm to have a woman sing to me like that.  The summer heat and the humid waves of a sultry tropical night undulate through this music. This is the stuff for very little clothing and lots of romance. The ballads are uncomplicated paeans to a lover, the sambas are just so swinging as to inspire you to walk in time with the music. This is just a lot of fun. Gilberto's voice is perfect for all of it. She has assembled such a brilliant cast of musicians that they collectively honour her father's legacy and advance the bossa nova seduction well into the Twenty-first Century. The recording is pristine. You can virtually here fingers touch the nylon strings of the guitars and the percussion percolates as though you were surrounded by the players. Quite an impressive recording! Many's the ostensible chanteuse, particularly the blonde ones, who ought to woodshed with this CD until they get it right (and lose their self absorbed English husbands). In any case, this is what seductive jazz singing sounds like, and I suspect I shall be listening to this through the summers on PEI and well into the frosts of winter. It has a passionately warming effect.
