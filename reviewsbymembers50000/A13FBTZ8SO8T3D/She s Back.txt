 One of the very best and most creative artists ever in rock music has returned with an incredible tour de force. This is her best since THE SENSUAL WORLD, and with Del Palmer, Paddy Bush and even Rolf Harris on board (Tie me Kangaroo down, mate), this is a superb collection of songs that contemplate life in all its glorious manifestations and final moments. It is without question her most profound statement to date. When you think of how she is sweeping aside all the Kate-wannabes from Amos thru McKennitt and McLaughlin, there is even more to celebrate with this disc. The knuckleheaded new-age ramblings of the faux-Kates fall away and what you have here is the genuine article. The instrumentation on each song is absolutely spot on. Her voice is as amazing as ever, and the fact that she can get across both the joys of motherhood and the philosophy of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross without coming across as either twee or preposterous tells you all you need to know about the craft of songwriting with a clear eye on the details. Her command of metaphor, her phrasing in her singing, her edft touch on the piano are all here in spades. There is no point in isolating a track or two. This is meant to be considered as a whole, and so, take this up, thank your lucky stars that she has come up with another brilliant CD, and in fact, thank David Gilmour for spotting the talent within her all those years ago.
