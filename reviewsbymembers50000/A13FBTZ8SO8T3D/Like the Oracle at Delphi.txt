 Janis sang the truth. This was only her third album, and it was to be her last, and the tragedy of that gets to you as you listen to the greatest woman ever in rock and blues take apart these songs. There is an overwhelming sense of tragedy as she delivers the famous "Mercedes Benz," but if you can divorce what you know from listening to this disc, especially the Legacy edition, you'll receive one of the most sublime musical experiences of your life. Every cut was perfect, even the title Coda instrumental that closes what was the official release. Richard Bell and his Canadian cohorts proved that Roberston, Danko & Co. weren't the only Ontarians who could deliver the goods. They band was perfect at every moment. Proof positive comes on the swecond disc, which is culled from the Festival Express tour across Canada. The tour occured before the recording of PEARL, but you can hear PEARL coming. The second disc is one of the best live CDs you'll ever hear. It is just such a shame that Joplin fell victim to old habits. There is a circle in hell for the rotten scum who sold her the uncut horse. Anyway, there would not be a voice with this kind of power again in rock until Sinead, whose wild horses are more psychological. All the same, nothing prepared rock for Janis when she hit her stride, and singers, male or female since, have never been the same. This is, beyond the cliche, what a classic CD sounds like. Do yourself a favour and pick this up.
