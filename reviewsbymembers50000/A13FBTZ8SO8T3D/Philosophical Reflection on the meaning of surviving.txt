 Nguyen Le has turned in another ruminative consideration of the spiritual quality of life, this time ably assisted by Paul McCandless and others, inspired by his own close call with cancer. As he has done in works ranging from the Hendrix tribute Colour of Purple to his mystical Tales From Viet Nam, and in all his work with his partner Huong Thanh from Moon and Wind through Dragonfly to Mangustao, he has given the guitar a unique voice. No easy task. That voice speaks like the writinigs of Thich Naht Hanh, and seeks to utter that quiet space where what is most fundamentally true remains silent. In considering this paradox, Le articulates in lines more Viet Namese and Buddhist than anything in the Western tradition of Jazz, save perhaps where Coltrane was beginning to go at the end of his life. Add McCandless and his soulful oboe and reed work, which seemed to first catch my ears in the Paul Winter Consort's epochal ICARUS, and you have a contemplation of critical moments in life that re-direct your intentionality. This is brilliant music.
