 that hides your soul is the subject, focus, dialectic of this remarkable achievement. From my standpoint, this is one of the greatest novels ever written, and deals so viscerally and passionately with the questions a man faces in dealing with how he might have been, even willingly, ground beneath the wheel of a technological age. Our alienation from our planet is played out in our relationships. Sexuality takes the place of intimacy, technicological surveillance usurps wisdom and insight, and yet the human soul refuses to take the hemlock, and like a Socratic heroine and hero who have resolved to rise up from paying homage to the shadows before them,  a daughter's search for her mother and her father's search for himself uncover all the dangerous questions we face when our lives come apart. And in the end there is a triumph of profound dimensions. I would encourage you to pick this up at once. I have read it several times and come away enriched after each reading. This is the story of how we exist at this point in the epoch of time.
