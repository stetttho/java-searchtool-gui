 Entirely mistitled, this. It has musically a lot less to do with "Fisherman's Blues" than it does with essaying the transition from "This is The Sea". Themes, lyrics and instrumentation are a lot less organic and rootsier than they would be on "Fisherman's" and "Room to Roam." In fact, the songs are less layered sonically than on previous Waterboys' rocords, but still, there is something that has not yet happened to push Scott into that place where his Irish sojourn would have its most profound impact. There are bootlegs out there that chronicle the next steps in the transitions as Scott, Anto, Blennerhasset, Hutchinson, Wickham and company moved out of the studio and into the pubs and the Gaeltacht that dramatically altered what was Scott's direction in every respect. Perhaps he has better quality tapes than what is out there and so perhaps that will be the next "Fisherman's" Installment. Nonetheless it is a great record. The songs are terrific, played with fire and commitment. This is definitely a band in a period of transition, but not quite ready to cut their moorings. That was still to come. Scott suggests there are hundreds of hours of music still to be distilled, and so perhaps that ragile threshold will be revealed, the faery door uncovered. For the meantime, both in the live sets and the studio work, this is a great addition to the Waterboys cannon. I'd heartily recommend it, but don't expect what would turn out to be one of the great folk/roots albums ever. It is  a coda to what was a brilliantly inspired rock band.
