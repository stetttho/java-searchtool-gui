 One of the things that this DVD demonstrates is that Stills was actually capable of pretty nifty playing when he checked his ego at the footlights. Long overlooked, and often deservedly so, Stephen Stills could, when he made up his mind, assemble a crack,no pun intended, ensemble of musicians and generate considerable heat, so long as he could refrain from showboating. This is a good concert video of the electric portion of his concerts from this era. It is too short, the audio is only of adequate quality (i.e. better than the available boots), but you took a chance with Stills acoustically, so maybe there just wasn't a good take on the acoustic set available to this team. What you do get is an appreciation of the considerable talnts of Chris Hillman, who ought to be awarded his own place in the Hall of Fame for having endured both Crosby and Stills. Hillman is the reason this band was so good on its good nights. And in all honesty, he brought out the best in Stills that the saturated fat of CSNY could not. So, does it make a case for elevating Steve Stills in the pantheon of rock performers? Well, almost...........
