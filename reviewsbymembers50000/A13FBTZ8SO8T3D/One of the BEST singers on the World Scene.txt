 All hail Amazon.com for making this fantastic CD available to the US market! Saoud Massi is a bright young French Algerian singer now living in Montmartre. Her guitar work, her voice, her songs themselves have set her apart on the folk roots, world music scene as an artist to be reckoned with. By comparison, her North American sisters pale as poseurs, be they Alicia Keyes, Idia.Arie or the shrill or self consciously poetic songwhiners. This is a woman with something to say and the sophistication to get it across. Like Rokia Traore and Huong Thanh, she is infused with the wealth and the subtleties of her culture, yet confidant enough to advance its treasures through her own voice. The crack musicianship surrounding her is absolutely perfect on every tune. This is the kind of soul and spirit that Bonnie Raitt summoned early on, and you'll find with Massi that she has that same sense of strength, passion, vulnerability and resolve to be her own woman. Songs are in French, but there is that Middle Eastern smokiness to the vocals, a sensual and ... line to the guitar work, and a rhythmic intensity to the bottom end that makes this music get under you, inside you, possess you. Miles once said he made music for "copulating", in all its sensual and spiritual ramifications, and so is this. Absolutely, purchase this CD. I first heard a tune from this on a sampler from fROOTS magazine, an absolutely essential publication for anyone whose need for genuine music exceeds what is programmed in North America. With one deft release, Saoud Massi has made the sirens of the US record industry totally and categorically irrelevant. This is music that matters. Get it.
