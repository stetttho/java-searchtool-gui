 One of the best songwriters and performers out there rarely leaves Canada, and almost rarely leaves his native Maritime province of PEI, but he is a sublime, world-class writer of extraordinary songs. This latest is another gem, including some English translations of songs from his French language CD, Le Vent Boheme. In fact, that title, Gypsy Wind, is nearly the best thing he has ever written. Pieces of You makes a reappearance here and along with Perfect Kiss are gurranteed to break your heart. Seven Years is another incredibly powerful tune about how difficult it is to get your heart across to someone. The instrumentation is his basic folk-rock-roots back up band, and there is a brilliant reading of the French song, Plage, to finish the official side of the CD off. It's followed by 3 bonus tracks that enhance the world-weary romantic take on life that is Lennie's stock in trade. Gallant shares McCartney's ability and talent for writing memorable melodies and poignant lyrics. His stories are to the heart, and often reflect a certain esprit that comes from having been raised in North Rustico, PEI. His songs are close to the earth, the sea, the hearts and souls of real people. Next to Lightfoot and Cockburn, there is no greater Candian songwriter on the scene.
