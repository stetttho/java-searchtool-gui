 This is one of those rare CD compilations that is a lot better than the source CDs from which the songs were culled. I am not sure I can explain it, but for wahtever reason, once Bill Berry left the band, the chemistry was altered enough to somehow sap REM of that drive that made them the most compelling American band ever. Stipe seemed preoccupied iwth his own ambivalent preferences, Peter Buck got distracted by side projects. Mike just seemed to wonder when it would all come back together. Pretty much everything after AUTOMATIC is lame. And this set draws most heavily from the GREEN through AUTOMATIC period, while managing to salvage what was worth it from the rest. As a collection then, it hangs together extremely well, drives with the urgency that was their hallmark and reminds you what a dynamic presence and welcome harbinger they were in their prime. Perhaps this will also serve to remind them what they are capable of. Currently, they are working with Bill Rieflin in the drum chair. They should make that permanent and get back to the dynamics of being a great quartet. Until then, savour this, especially the 2 CD set. It is absolutely their best effort since, well, since GREEN.
