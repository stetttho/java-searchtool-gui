 Rudy Van Gelder and the entire Impulse team deserve tremendous praise and gratitude for what a remarkable transformation in sound quality they have delivered on the studio and live performances of John Coltrane's immortal and masterful A LOVE SUPREME. Unless you've been listening to Afghan radio the past 35 years, you should have no doubt as to the importance of this work to the entire spectrum of Twentieth Century music. It is hard to imagine a more important composition or performance from any artist, let alone someone as immortal himself as the wonder inspiring John Coltrane. That said, as happy as I have been with all of my copies, from vinyl to previous remasters, I was completely blown away by what I heard for the first time. I've had a number of Euro copies of the live performance, and by comparison, this CD makes those renditions sound like a cover band.  You'll have to take it at that. There is not enough space to discuss the overwhelming significance and the mighty protean performances in the studio and on the concert stage by Trane, Tyner, Garrison and Jones.  They were firing on all cylinders at this point in their careers and what a mightily profound and soul stirring legacy they have left the rest of us mere mortals. John was clearly contemplating the image of God in this work, and this passion infused here is as terrifying as that of Francis of Assissi in mid-stigmata, or Gurdijeff in whirling dervish absorption, or the Boddhisatva at the moment of enlightenment. Passionately mystical, this work is one of a love supreme by its creator for his Creator. To think now you can hear it as closely as it is possible as John himself might have heard it - well, I can not tell you the stunningly profound impact it will have upon you. Purchase this CD. It will live with you forever.
