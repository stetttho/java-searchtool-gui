 This is a good general introduction to cryonic and nanotech life extension, but barely touches on a lot of the issues therein. Clearly written to be a popular piece instead of a "substantial" one. The  Socratic question-and-answer format makes it seem more of a straw-man  argument than one would hope. There are many better books on nanotech out  there, and though I applaud the author for trying to raise public awareness  of cryonics as legitimate science, he goes too far towards pop culture.
