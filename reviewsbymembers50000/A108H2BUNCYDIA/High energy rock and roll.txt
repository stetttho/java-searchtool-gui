 Def Leppard is often referred to as "a supergroup of the 80s" and that's true as far as it goes. But though today's Top 40 music doesn't match their style, they continue to produce excellent records with their  characteristic high-energy style of never-say-die rock and roll. A worthy  successor to Hysteria and Pyromania, although I still find Hysteria their  best album. But for any instance when you feel like some adrenaline-pumping  rock and roll to get your blood moving, I heartily recommend this album.
