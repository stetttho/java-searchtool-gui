 I ordered this DVD with the expectation that it'd be an amusing return to childhood diversions of getting up early to watch Star Blazers before school. I was pleasantly surprised how well it translated to DVD and how well the story held up. No, it's not a work of genius, and I had hoped for some "DVD special features", but it was everything I expected and then some.
