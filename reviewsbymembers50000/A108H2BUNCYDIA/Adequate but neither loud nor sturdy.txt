 Don't get me wrong - this headset does get the job done, and is more comfortable than those atrocious "ear buds". This device clips on over your ear and positions the mic perhaps midway down your cheek (unless you have a really tiny face). Audio reproduction is thus adequate but tends to pick up background noise. Similarly, the speaker in the headset would probably be pretty good if it were form-fitting with your ear, but as it stands I find it hard to hear, especially when driving. (And after all, that's what you usually want the headset for, right?) My final concern would be the lightweight construction. It isn't falling apart, by any means, but I get the impression that if I accidentally sat on it - or subjected it to the sort of manhandling it'd get when tucked into my laptop bag - that it might readily be damaged. I'd still rather get a better headset, if one were available. That being said, it does do the job.
