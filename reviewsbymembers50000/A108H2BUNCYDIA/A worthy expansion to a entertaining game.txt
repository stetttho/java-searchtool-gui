 The Command and Conquer saga has been running for a while and occasionally starts to show its age. This expansion pack, though not revolutionary, provides some additional depth and strength to balance out Tiberian Sun  effectively. NOD players will love the new spider-cyborg, and GDI finally  gets a worthwhile artillery unit with the Juggernaut. Enough new units,  twists, and tactics to give the game a different spin (also, some of the  more outrageous effects from the initial game are turned down - NOD  artillery is now a little more "under control"). Better balanced  game, and very good if you enjoy the C&C genre.
