 I bought a pair of these for my folks on their anniversary. They're sturdy, natural-looking, and are comfortable to kick back in. Assembly is pretty easy, although not all that fast, and they do occasionally have splinters. Once it's weathered a bit, though, they are great to lounge in and birdwatch or read or just enjoy the sun.
