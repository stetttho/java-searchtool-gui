 I found this text to be a good overview of Cisco practices and rationale behind the decisions that have brought the company to this point. Inside Cisco is quite readable, in fact perhaps erring too much on the side of easy readability - it could stand to be condensed a bit into a "Cliff's Notes" version. For all that, however, it's convenient to have a reference as to the Cisco processes; most companies considering any sort of M&A activitity could stand to take pointers!
