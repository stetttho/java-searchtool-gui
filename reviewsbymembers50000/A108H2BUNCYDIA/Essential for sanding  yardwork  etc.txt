 Allergies are a killer, especially in the spring when so many home-renewal projects hit. Clean up the yard? Do a little woodwork? Painting? Maybe you're blessed with a lack of allergies, but I for one am often impaired by  that sort of thing. So if you have to knock down the Scotch Broom that is  infesting the yard, or some other high-pollen-count invader... one of these  can be quite handy. Well put together and a solid product. Glad to see  Amazon carrying it.
