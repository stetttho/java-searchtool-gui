 A definitive and original work of fantasy, this book comprises Zelazny's ten Amber novels. Drawing elements from Celtic myth and branching out from  there, to Alice in Wonderland and beyond, this work is a truly delightful  read - the Amberites are a terribly Machiavellian lot but all the more  entertaining for their squabbles. Filled with wry humor and a fascinating  cast of characters, this book spans two generations of the Barimen clan  (Corwin, and his son Merlin), each of which were initially five separate  novels. The two halves of the book have a very different flavor, and I  confess I enjoy the first more than the second... but they are both  interesting in their own way. In any case, a unique work, and one that  should delight any fantasy reader.
