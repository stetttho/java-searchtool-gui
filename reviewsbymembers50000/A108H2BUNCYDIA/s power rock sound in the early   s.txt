 This album has the feel of a late-80s rock performance, which may account for some disgruntlement among those who regarded the early 90s as an era for grunge and industrial music and nothing else. I can't say I enjoyed  everything on the disk - that almost never happens anyway - but it's more  than enough for me to give it five stars for the energetic rock and ballads  mixed herein.
