 Bruce Sterling steps to the opposite end of the spectrum from some of his earlier high-energy works to write this almost lacksadical piece. Holy Fire is a story of a successful "life extender" who regains her youth  and really has nothing to do with it other than go sightseeing. Brilliant  paean to Sterling's descriptive talents and imagination, but this is a book  where not much happens other than the scenery. I had hoped for a lot more.
