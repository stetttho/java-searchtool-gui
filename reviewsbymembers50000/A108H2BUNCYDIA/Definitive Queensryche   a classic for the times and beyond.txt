 Concept albums are tricky, and can easily turn out to be a cheesy smirkfest of inside jokes. Operation Mindcrime, on the other hand, is a brilliant expose of the times - it was conspiracy before conspiracy was  cool (to butcher a metaphor). Engrossing storytelling, definitive  characters, vivid music and plot - this feels like a movie soundtrack or an  opera, and easily could have been. Superb guitar work, biting lyrics,  insightful story ... I recommend this album without reservation.
