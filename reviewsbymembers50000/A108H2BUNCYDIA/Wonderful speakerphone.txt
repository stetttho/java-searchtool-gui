 After getting frustrated with typical multipurpose phones (handset,  speakerphone, answering machine, caller ID, potato peeler, and inflatable  raft all in one) I went looking for an excellent speakerphone. This gets my  highest recommendation. The sound is clear, the ability to carry on a  two-way conversation without noticable pausing or clipping is wonderful,  and the system is compact and easy to use. One slight caveat: though the  microphones are sensitive enough for everyday use and the speaker can be  turned up loud enough to make the party at the other end of the line  clearly audible, there is a certain threshold below which you cannot hear  the individual at the other end of the line - in this case, a handset can  be superior. (I didn't downgrade this system from five stars for this,  though - all speakerphones seem to have this problem.)
