 In his usual satirical style, P.J. O'Rourke tours the bars of the world and the economies of the various nations around. He skewers many popular  myths about economic success or lack thereof, dispenses humorous anecdotes  that contradict many "central planning" schools of thought, and  generally makes an excellent case for how and why economies work like they  do. Highly engaging tale of why some nations are poorer than dirt and  others do better - or as he puts it "America - it doesn't suck".  Read it for a good macro view of econ, and how that relates in the real  world to you and I who live it.
