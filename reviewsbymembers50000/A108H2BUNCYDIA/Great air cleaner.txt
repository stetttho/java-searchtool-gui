 The usual expedient delivery from Amazon left me with this product sitting in a box for a couple of days before I had rearranged the furniture to place it where I'd intended. The effect is dramatic - this system cleans the air quickly and very effectively even on the lowest setting. Fortunately, it has three different speeds - the highest speed is rather loud, and I recommend turning it down before bedtime. This is by far the best air purifier I've ever owned.
