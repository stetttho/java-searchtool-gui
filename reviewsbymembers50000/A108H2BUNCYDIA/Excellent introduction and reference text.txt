 What is refactoring, why is it a good idea, and what are good mechanisms for doing so? I highly recommend this text for those involved in software development, especially later in the software life cycle when maintenance is a crucial issue. Honestly, even if you just read the first three chapters you get the gist of the book (the majority of the book is specific types of refactoring) and enough knowledge to decide on whether refactoring is a useful thing for your code base (it almost always is). An excellent look at a crucial part of "Extreme Programming" and a useful part of development of all sorts.
