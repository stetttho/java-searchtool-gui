 Though the concept of the Magister as a Highlander-for-magi "there can be only one" concept promises high adventure and danger, this book doesn't seem to live up to that. One might term the Magister an avatar of Mystra, although that would not quite be correct... it's more a position  akin to a research professorship bequeathed by the ultimate Dean of  Studies. Too much filler material, drawn with a broad brush and overly  stereotyped - this book seems like it should have been a couple chapters in  a larger text rather than padded out to fill its own volume.
