 Certainly does the job - they're not as durable as I might like, but if you're assembling a server rack or otherwise in need of a number of monitor  extension cables, you could do worse than this. I bought five and I'm happy  with them - you're not paying for the Monster Cable kind of durability. I  haven't seen any ghosting or other problems, even in a fairly crowded  server rack, although I can understand why the other reviewer would find  that to be a problem!
