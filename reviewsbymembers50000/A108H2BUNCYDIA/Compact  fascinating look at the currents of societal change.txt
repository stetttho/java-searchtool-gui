 Interesting anecdotal stories, theories, and conjecture blend in a discussion of how trends spread and grow. Fascinating to see Paul Revere cast in a whole new light and why his "call to arms" succeeded  where others failed. Insightful assertions about Hush Puppies, adoption of  smoking, teen suicide, and how these change - curiously, I found his  discussions about how to "enforce change" almost at odds with the  initial thesis. All in all, an excellent book for making you think and  recognize cultural patterns... but if you were hoping for a road map to  structuring your own tipping points, you'll have to write it yourself.  (Which, I suspect, is the point.) This book won't change the world, but it  may give you guidance on the path to do so. Recommended to anyone who wants  to know how or why trends arise and spread.
