 I had seen chairs of similar appearance before, so I was pretty dubious about these. Boy, was I surprised! These are easy to set up and take down, comfortable, light, and convenient. (They are bulky, though.) I would recommend them for anyone who doesn't want full-time yard chairs but would occasionally like to sun themselves out on the lawn, or perhaps take a chair to the beach, camping, or to a tailgate party.
