  I've been picking up all the alsatian cookbooks I can find, and so this one seemed promising. However, something about it just didn't pay off for me. The cookbook is broken down by seasons, which is always a plus, but none of the recipes seemed appealing to me. The ingredients tend to be things not normally found in the local markets (ex. "Wine braised beef cheeks with chanterelle goulash."), and are frankly quite intimidating to me (let alone, the picky (yet adorable!) person I cook for). The recipes are also very, very complex.
