 Not so much a cookbook as a meditation on the art of slow food. There are plenty of recipes, but the author concentrates more on the way you prepare the food. A former chef at Chez Pannise, he approches cooking with devout respect. This book could have been called "The Zen of Cooking," and focuses on techniques of fine italian cuisine. A good book, it's probably not appropriate for the casual cook.
