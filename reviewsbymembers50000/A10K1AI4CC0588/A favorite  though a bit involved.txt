 While I don't think this book would be good for novice cooks, this is a great introductory book for classic French cooking. I've tried several recipes, and have been happy with the results of all of them. The recipes do seem to be a bit involved and called for some expensive ingredients, but it's unlikely you'll be making many of the recipes frequently, so for special occasions, it's worth the extra trouble. And the trouble pays off in spades. For example, I made the recipe for braised short ribs, which were quite delicious. As an added bonus, though, the recipe made enough delicious gravy that I froze in tiny containers and ended up serving along side steaks and beef for the next two months.  Finally, I also really like the look of the book, which is evocative of the golden age of food extravagance, in Edwardian books published 100 or more years ago. It's full of beautiful photographs, and could probably be right at home on a hardcore foodie's coffee table.
