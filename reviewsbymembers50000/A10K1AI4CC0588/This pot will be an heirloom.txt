 Even at the great price Amazon is selling this pot for, it's still very expensive, but these pots are virtually indestructable, last a lifetime, and you'll be able to hand it down to your grandchildren. And this is a great price.. I've been keeping track for awhile now, and this price rivals used models sold on eBay. Le Creuset pots offer all of the great qualities of cast iron (even heating, heat retention, heavy) without the downsides (no seasoning required, tolerant of acidic foods, no metallic aftertastes). I'd be buying this one myself today if it weren't for the fact that someone would kill me if I spent this kind of money on something with my birthday coming up so soon!
