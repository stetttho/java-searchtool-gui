 Anyone who is looking for a new experience with the Civilization series and who buys this new version is in for a big disappointment. Conversely, everything you loved about the older versions of Civ are still here, and a little bit more. Civ 4 is mostly just a cosmetic update, and it succeeds well at that. Any of the modifications to the game play are so minor that only a hardcore Civ Junkie will notice them.  It took me awhile to get the game running. It didn't run well on my laptop -- a graphical problem with the font the game used made the game unplayable. And it balked at playing on my desktop PC, requiring about an hour of installing and de-installing my video and directx drivers due to a known bug with the installer program and my videocard (ATI), but ultimately I was successful, once I visited the support website.  The new graphics are pretty -- allowing you to swoop from a godlike view of the map all the way down to an isometric close-up of your troops, workers and cities.   One major difference between this version and last is that it's designed for multiplayer over the net, right out of the box. I haven't tested those functions, though, and I suspect I probably never will, at least not with random players. (I don't relish the thought of getting my gameplaying dinner handed to me by some faceless 10 year old in Albuquerque.) But I have a friend on the other side of the planet who I might want to challenge, so having the option is great.   So is it worth buying? If you've never played before,  then yes. The game is deeply addictive to a large segment of the game-playing population, and has been for years. (What does it tell you that I ended up staying up all night last night playing?) If you loved the game before, then it's worth buying, if only to keep food on Sid Meier's table, so he can keep producing his wonderful games, but don't expect a radical new experience.
