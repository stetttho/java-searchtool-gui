  Ina Garten gives us a very americanized french recipe book. Many of her recipes are americanized, and familiar. Geared more toward the casual cook than some of the other french cookbooks available this year. But Ina can't do wrong as far as I'm concerned, though her recipes tend to be anything but dietetic. It's probably more accurate to classify the food in this cookbook as "inspired by french cooking," than strictly french fare. However, for some home cooks, this might be exactly the right approach.
