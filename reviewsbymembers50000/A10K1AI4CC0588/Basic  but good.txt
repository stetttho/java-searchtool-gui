 After some not so successful experiments with dishes at a recent family gathering, I decided to pick this one up. It's certainly not full of gourmet fare, but its full of the sort of thing everyone loves and remembers from when they were kids... familiar, stick-to-your-ribs recipes. Though the food is geared towards crowds (most recipes serve 6-8 people, so they're definitely going to be leftovers in our house when I make them). None of the recipes are complex, nor do they require outlandish ingredients, and are well within the grasp of all but the most inept chefs. This is a good, basic cookbook that anyone who enjoys cooking for a crowd would love.
