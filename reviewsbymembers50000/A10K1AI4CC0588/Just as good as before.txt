 I've only played about 2% of this game, but I can already tell I like it a lot. Not much has changed in the graphics engine since the last go-round, but it's still visually stunning. The voice-acting is completely awful. The game has lots of new monsters, and they've fixed some of the gameplay issues since the last time. I still have had a little trouble with the targetting during the battles... if you don't click directly on the (usually moving) offending foe, you'll sometimes run past them (and usually into the clutches of their buddies behind them, such that you're completely surrounded). A very minor complaint. Like almost any other game of the hack-and-slash genre, there's really not much more than hacking and slashing, which can get a little tedious, but that's a flaw of the genre, and not this particular game. Make sure you have an oomphy system to play, too, and you'll be rewarded. And if you never played the earlier version, now's your chance, as they bundle it in with this new game.
