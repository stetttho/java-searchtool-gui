 I've been playing this game for about a week. I keep running into "impossible" tasks that take me a couple hours to accomplish. If you're like me, this is fun, in a masochistic, maddening, vein-popping-out-of-your-temple, throw-the-effing-joystick-across-the-room sort of way. I don't find this game offensive, despite the "darker" overtones that it has over the previous Jak & Daxter game. The game environment is lush and extensive. Not that I have many complaints, but one thing that does bug me is that a lot of gametime is spent moving through parts of the city that, aside from other hover-cars or pedestrians (that are mostly just obstacles), and an occasional fruit basket, there's not much interaction. I'd like to be able to explore the huts in the doc area, or enter the shops in the bazaar area.  This game does provide lots and lots of gameplay variety, though. You never know what your next task is going to be. From escort missions, to timed races, to third-person shooting, to Dance-Dance-Revolution-like button-mashing challenges.  This game will provide you hours and hours of very challenging and diverse gameplay, and fans of the platform genre will not be disappointed.
