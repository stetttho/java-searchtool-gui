 But for the money, it probably can't be beat. I've had bad results using non-Lexmark printer cartidges, though. And, aside from the sheer wastefullness, at the price these printers go for new, it's cheaper to buy another whole printer (along with the ink cartidges it comes with) than to spend the extra $10 to buy just the ink cartidges all by themselves!
