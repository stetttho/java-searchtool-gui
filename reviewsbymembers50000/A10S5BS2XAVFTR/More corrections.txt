 Someone please tell that reviewer that s/he is an episode off.  Really people do the math.  Since the volumes each contain three episodes the third episode's number is divisible by three.  Eighty-five is not divisible by three, eighty-four is.  That said, if you are an Inuyasha fan then even, though, you haven't seen it you know this will be a great set of episodes.  From what I hear Koga has a self-appointed fiance who returns to claim him.  You know it is going to be good with that introduction. These episodes are in their Japanese traslated titles, (I don't think anyone knows the english ones yet.) 82: The present and warring states era connection. 83: The female wolf demon and the promise of the moon rainbow. 84: The superspeed marriage deal.
