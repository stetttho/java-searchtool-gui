 I went to Inuyashaworld.com and looked up the episodes.  I haven't yet seen them but if it's Inuyasha it is going to be good. (Do note these are the japanese translated titles.  I don't know the english ones.) EPISODE 76:  TARGET IS SESSHOMARU AND INUYASHA EPISODE 77:  HYOUNEKOZOKU AND THE TWO TEETH SWORD EPISODE 78:  AIMING FOR SANGO, ONLY YOU
