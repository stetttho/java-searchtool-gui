 Kagome is your average middle school student.  Her family are the caretakers of an ancient shrine.  Kagome had no patients for all the stories her grandfather would recite at will until the day a demon popped out of the bone-eater's well and dragged her into fuedal Japan.  There she meets the not-so-charming Inuyasha, a half-demon dog, who wants the Shikon no Tama in order to become a full-demon.  When Kagome accidently shatters the jewel while trying to get it back from a demon she and Inuyasha have to team up to find the scattered shards.  Let the games begin!
