 I went to Inuyashaworld.com and looked the episode titles up. I haven't seen these episodes but if it's Inuyasha is going to be good. (These are the japanese titles translations.  I don't know the english ones.) EPISODE 79:  JAKEN'S TETSUSAIGA-SNATCHING OPERATION EPISODE 80:  SESSHOMARU AND THE ABDUCTED RIN EPISODE 81:  FINALLY BROKEN NARAKU'S MYSTERY
