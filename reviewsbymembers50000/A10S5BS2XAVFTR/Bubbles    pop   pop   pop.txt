 The battle with Juromaru and Kageromaru where Koga and Inuyasha team up aside this disk obviously shows they were cleaning the studio that week.  How else could you explain getting a pair of episodes that was mainly soap suds.  Now I think the series needed this slow down to allow our heroes time to reflect on relationships, but will someone please smack Inuyasha!  Inuyasha basically said it himself that all his feelings for Kikyo are revolving around guilt and obligation because Kikyo died for him.  He feels it's necessary to give his life for her at the very least.  Please, the girl pulled a knife on him while they were embracing and even said he was like Naraku in his feelings toward her.  How many more evil things does this dead priestess have to do before he gets a clue that the Kikyo he fell in love with is no longer going by that name?
