 Season 3 is best by far with how much the characters grow.  I would very much like to see Seasons 1 and 2 get on DVD especially Season 2 which sets up Season 3 with the web creature entering Mainframe and their battle to save Mainframe from the evils of the web and treachery of the guardians. However, did everyone forget about Daemon?  Reboot Season 4 aired briefly, and I mean briefly, on Toonami a couple of years ago.  I missed the event but I assume it involved the battle to take back the super computer and save the guardians from Daemon. So Season 3 is not the series end.  I would love to see Season 4 so start pressuring the producers to put it on DVD ASAP!
